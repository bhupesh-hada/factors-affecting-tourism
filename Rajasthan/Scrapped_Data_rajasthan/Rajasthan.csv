Rani Ki Vav 1
Just layers and layers of intricate rock carvings. This vav was re-excavated in the early 1960s having been almost forgotten completely and filled in with debris over many years. It is perhaps the best example of a baori in all India. Rani is Hindi for Queen.
November 2016



Gujarat and Rajasthan, India



“Sing like no one's listening, love like you've never been hurt, dance like nobody's watching, and live like its heaven on earth.”

Mark Twain



“Aim at heaven and you will get earth thrown in. Aim at earth and you get neither.”

C.S. Lewis



“The ''kingdom of Heaven'' is a condition of the heart -not something that comes ''upon the earth'' or ''after death.''”

Nietzsche



How often are our experiences of the manifested world, both natural and man-made, an essay on the labyrinths of our minds? It only needs us to stop .. just stop the mind's side chatter for a moment in time... and simply experience that which is before us. Stepping down into the depth of the Rani Ki Vav in Patan (Gujarat) on Christmas day 2013, there was a sense of full emptiness... fullness of sensual representation of a past civilisation and the mystique that surrounded this conception of ritualised bathing and cleansing activity; and emptiness in terms of the unknown beyond the depth that brought me face to face with my own mortality and the passing of time. And then the thought that me there as part of 21st Century tourism in that moment was just another reality that maybe one day would be a conceptual experience for some future being in this same spot.



In the northern Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat,
Rani Ki Vav 2
The well/pool in the depths of the vav.
the problem of water is a profound one. Reminiscent of Jules Verne’s Journey to the Center of the Earth — where the characters come across a massive underground mass of water — there exists under large parts of these states a vast (if diminishing in recent times) subterranean sea. Where even annual weather cycles mean scarcity of water, let alone the intermittent serious droughts that occur, it's no wonder that heaven can be conceptualised as not just above the earth... but below too where sacred and life sustaining waters abide. Water plays a special part in Hindu mythology, as a boundary between heaven and earth known as tirtha.



Situated at the edge of the Thar desert, these states experience torrential seasonal monsoons. Almost immediately that water disappears through the silty soils. The wet season is followed by dry summers with 40 degree plus temperatures. In times bygone, a solution for locals and travelers along trade routes was the creation of the stepwell. The earliest of these new types of wells date to about 550 AD, with the more elaborate examples being built in medieval times. Over 3,000 such wells were built in these two north-eastern states.

Situated on the outskirts of Patan in Gujarat. Here the intricate detail of the rock carvings.



As man-made tirtha, the stepwells provided sustenance, and a cool refuge for bathing, prayer, and meditation. In Hindi they are are variously called baori, baoli, baudi, bawdi, or bavadi. In Gujarati, they are commonly called vav.



During the British Raj, the English rulers, with their particular views on sanitation, discouraged the use of the wells and they started to fall into disuse and ruin. Pumps and pipes were the new technology, and the the use of stepwells were often banned. Heaven was delegated to hell somehow, despite centuries of traditional efficient and effective usage of the well system.



I first came across baories in Bundi, Rajasthan. I have been to this place perhaps a dozen times. I love the respite on my motorbike journeys from the Himalayas to other parts of Rajasthan. My guest house of choice has a platform just beside the Sagar Lake ideal for sunrise yoga. There are many baories throughout the amazing old town, with most in disrepair. However the major baorie administered under the National Monuments scheme in the middle of town is kept in pristine condition. Next to it are a pair of open squared baories
Chand Baori
Mesmerizing steps
with the type of steps suggesting that the dutch graphic artist Escher might well have visited India (there is no evidence that he did) before he started on his explorations of infinity, reflection and symmetry, often depicting steps to nowhere.



I have happened upon other delights in Patan (Gujarat); at Amber Fort in Jaipur; and the Chand Baori on the road between Jaipur and Fatehpur Sikri. Then one comes across baories all over the place in northern India.



And so.... stepping down to heaven …. into the bowels of mother earth. Somehow it feels comforting down in these refuges below the chaos of what is above on the surface.

This morning was an early start for the safari. It was very misty to begin with as you can see on the photo. Slowly the mist began to clear. The was a good variety of bird life. This included jungle fowl on the ground, green parakeets, two different woodpeckers, a quick blue flash of a kingfisher and Indian roller bird with flashes of blue on its wings. These birds were just flying or hopping around as birdssod, but more interestingly we also saw an eagle which had just caught a small bird. It flew up into a tree with its prey. In a nearby tree there was a different kind of eagle. We saw lots of spotted deer, but none of the bigger sambar deer. Up in the trees there were jungle squirrels and langur monkeys. The early morning sun coming through the trees was highlighted the wide variety of trees. Our wildlife spotter was on the lookout for tigers. He heard something from the animal calls and took us back to the area where a small lake is visible in the distance. He spotted a tiger not far from the water. I caught a very brief glimpse with my binoculars, but it was a long way away and difficult to see. Much easier to see and more interesting to watch were the wild dogs. They were nearer and could be seen with the naked eye as well as through binoculars. Photographs were not possible because they were behind scrub. They had dark thick tails and reddish coats. The carcass of their deer kill was clearly visible and they were taking turns to eat. One of the pack was keeping watch for other predators.



We were hungry for our late breakfast and it was a late start for the drive to Coorg. Coorg is a coffee growing area. And it is also a tourist area popular with the workers from Bangalore. We first drove to the Eco lodge where we are staying. This isrun by a couple who have a small farm. The cottage had a large room and next door a small plunge swimming pool just about deep enough and big enough for one stroke. In the afternoon we made the short drive to The town in the area to. Visit the fort and a viewpoint called Raja's seat. We also stopped at a supermarket sellipopp local coffee and spices. This shop was jammed full with Indian tourists.

Our dinner was home cooked food from the farm, a vegetable curry, dhal and a chicken curry. Very good.

Today we are in a new state, Karnataka. The drive this morning inclused a very attractive countryside section. This was introduced by what looked like hay spread out over the Tarmac road. Our driver told us that this is lentils. The cars and the traffic drive over and this seems to be part of the threshing process. Very unusual. The cows seemed to be enjoying eating the lentil stalks. There was also a section of the road with an avenue of banyan trees forming an arch over the road.

The lodge where we are staying is a luxury place, unusual for this trip. We have our own veranda with a view of the lake. There are hammocks and even a free mini-bar! We chose to do the jeep safari early tomorrow afternoon which gave us time to enjoy the facilities here. The lake was quite low, but we walked over and on the way spotted a large black ibis on the grass. There were more birds on the lake so we walked along the lake shore. There was a large grey heron, the same as in the UK, but also a much smaller heron. There was also a very large
P1018527.JPG
egret, small cormorants and different kinds of small wading birds. In addition to the water birds there were terns and swifts. As we walked back to our cottage we heard monkeys above us in the trees. These were the common monkeys we have seen before, but their behaviour in the trees was much more interesting than their roadsidE behaviour. They were eating the leaves of the tree and breaking off small branches and eating those. While sitting outside on the verandah in the evening the insects were coming into their own including a moth drawn to the light.

Shamrock Farms Book Club
We travelled over 8,000 miles back to Shamrock Farms from India armed with new camel blankets, camel knowledge and more camel connections than we had when we left over a month ago.

It only seemed fair that we shared all of this camel excitement with the loved ones who would appreciate it most - the Shamrock Farms camel herd!

With all of our new camel knowledge swirling in our heads, we had to decide where to start. The logical choice seemed to be Ilse's book Camel Karma. Dad bought his own copy of the book and read it on the trip.

With our two books and our new connection with the author, it only seemed fitting that we start a Shamrock Farms Book Club. The camels really embraced this idea.

I cannot tell if they really love the book or if they are just relieved we did not decide to teach them how the Raika install a nose peg!

Depuis quelques semaines les routes goudronnees et renovees fleurissent dans le quartier technologique. A savoir que la plupart des routes sont en terre et remplies de nids de poule. Vous ajoutez ca au fait qu'elles ne sont pas tres larges car ils sont depasses par le succes du parc technologique, et aussi l'instinct de l'indien qui essaye de gruger tout le monde et ca devient vite un bordel monstrueux. En plus il y a tres peu de feux alors ce sont les flics qui prennent le relais. Sauf qu'ils foutent plus le bordel qu'autre chose et puis personne ne les ecoutent vraiment a commencer par notre propre chauffeur.



Il y a une blague qui circulait sur internet il y a quelque temps : A la fin de Interstellar, la fille du hero, vieille dans son lit d'hopital, demande a son pere ou il etait tout ce temps. Son pere repond dans les embouteillage de Whitefield. Whitefield etant le quartier technologique ou l'on travaille. Cela represente parfaitement la realite des choses.

Notre premier jour a Dreamworks, ca nous a pris 1h30 pour rentrer a l'hotel seulement a 11 km de la. Les HR se sont limite excuses en disant que c'etait pas comme ca d'habitude, histoire de nous rassurer. C'est pas toujours autant que ca, mais c'est un bordel bien au dessus de la moyenne en general.



Bref, parfois on realise que du jour au lendemain ils ont rénovés toute une portion de route. Et souvent la portion est assez longue. Avec Aude on etait assez surpris de l'efficacite des indiens. Et bien non. Ce serait sans compter sur la corruption qui ronge tout le pays. Pour faire simple, les politiques font refaire les route pour justifier d'impots plus importants et s'acheter une villa privee ou autre. Jusque la ca va, c'est partout pareil. Sauf que si la route est trop bien faite et bien t'es vire. Un fois, une compagnie avait fait une route de bonne qualite. Elle n'a plus jamais eu de contrat avec le gouvernement ni personne d'autre. Elle a juste ete blackliste. Ce qui fait que 3 mois plus tard, a la moindre pluie ou degat des eaux, la plupart des routes se font emporter.

Voila un bon exemple de corruption en Inde.



Elle n'est generalement pas dans l'interet publique. Certains en arrivent meme a dire heureusement que le pays est corrompu, car cela permet de se sortir de situation impossible. Un pot de vin est le probleme est regle.

La derniere fois, un ami un indien nous a dit que beaucoup d'indiens avaient leur permis de conduire sans forcement le meriter. Certains manquent meme d'ecraser quelq'un a tous les coints de rue ou rentrer dans un poteau, et ce durant l'examen lui meme. Ils obtiennent tout de meme leur permis simplement parce que ce sont les auto ecoles qui payent directement les inspecteurs. Ca explique pas mal de choses quand au mode de conduite des indiens. Ca me rassure presque finalement.



L'ensemble du pays et fait comme ca, c'est un peu bancal syur plein d'aspect. La corruption est telle que chaque personne essaye va essayer de baiser une autre d'un amiere ou d'une autre et quelque soit la situation. Il faut etre tout le temps sur ses gardes.

La premiere fois qu'on a achete des bananes au supermarche, genre meme pas une semaine apres notre arrivee, la personne qui pesait nos bananes a taper un code d'un produit different et beaucoup plus cher afin de multiplier le prix par 10. On a ete vigilents et lui a signale que c'etait pas le bon pris. Je veux bien qu'on se trompe mais de la a confondre des bananes et des radis.... Surtout quand general, la personne te regarde avec un grand sourir qui veut dire pardon j'ai pas fait expres mais sont regard lui veut dire clairement j'ai failli te niquer.



La fois on on a acheter notre four et aspirateur (celui la meme qui n'avait pas la bonne prise), le prix total etait de 20000 roupies et des poussieres. Et j'avais droit a 1500 de rabais car au dessus des 20000 roupies. Arrive a la caisse il on simplement reduit l'adition de quelques roupies afin que je passe en dessous des 20k et perdre le rabais de 1500. Encore une fois j'ai pris un malin plaisir a leur mettre le nez dedans.

- ""Comment vous etes arrives a se resultat ?""

-""Et bien ca + ca""

-""Ok mon telephone me donne 20K vous voyez. Vous me devez 1500 de rabais""

Et puis les deux vendeuses se marrent entre elles et te regardent avec le meme air, genre pardon mais on voulait vraiment te niquer.



C'etait pourtant dans des magasins assez etablis, dans des centres commerciaux et qui ciblent pas la tranche social la plus pauvre. Le magasin d'a cote c'est Yamaha et Apple quoi. Et ben faut pas se filler aux apparences. Ou que tu ailles il faut faire attention, donc maintenant on est sur nos gardent. Et c'est a se demander quel interet ils ont a faire ca. Comme si ils etaient payes al commition. Je vais me renseigner a ce sujet car dans le supermarche, quand tu fais tes courses de bouffe, tous les 2 metres y a un vendeur pour te harceler. T'as le malheur de regarder un produit, chose que j'ai encore du mal a eviter quand je fais mes courses, autant pour moi. Tu peux etre sur que le vendeur le plus proche va te roder, probablement le mec a quelque centimetres de toi qui respire dans ton oreille. Et la c'est partie :

- ""Ca pas cher, ca meilleur qualite, ca crevette grosse, ca crevette moyenne, ca crevette petite, ca crevette curry,.....""

Et si tu regarde un autre produit il va enchainer sur ce produit.

Generalement Aude les envoie chier et moi je dis non une fois et apres je les ignore. Chacun son mode de reponse quoi. On commence a s'y faire mais au debut tu te sens vraiment agresse et mal a l'aise. Au debut on osait meme pas acheter quoique ce soit dans le magasin. On s'y sentait vraiment pas bien.

Parfois c'est vraiment utile et t'es content de recevoir un renseignement, mais la plupart du temps tu te sens juste observe.



Donc voila on est souvent sur nos gardes quand meme.

Ca plus le fait que quand ta carte bancaire passe pas ou que la connection au serveur n'a pas fonctionnee, et ben tu ne recois pas ton fameux ticket d'annulation et quand tu reesayes de payer tu te demande si tu va payer 2 fois ou pas. Mais au final on a jamais eu de mauvaise surprise. C'est juste un peu surprenant au debut. En general 30 seonde apres une transaction ta banque t'envoie un mail et un sms pour resummer la transaction. C'est pratique meme si ca rempli rapidement ta messagerie. Et finalement la seule fois ou on a paye deux fois pour la meme transaction, c'etait a Decathlon. Comme quoi les prejuges....



Le week end prochain on va visiter les ruines de Hampi sur 3 jours donc on aura surement des super souvenirs a partager.



Bonne annee et a la prochaine !

Bijapur, North Karnataka
Gol Gombuz
Christmas Holidays are probably the best time to travel for Bangaloreans. IT and related software companies which are the nerve-centre of Bangalore remain in comparatively leisurely mood.

This year (2015) Christmas was on Friday resulting in continuous three holidays. Unbearable traffic in ever-busy Bangalore Roads was not visible. Most residents either went to their native places or decided to break out of Bangalore. Above all Bangalore weather was excellent. I could not resist taking a long drive out of Bangalore, this time to the heritage sites of North Karnataka.

Karnataka boasts one of the finest architectural creations in India (if not the world) and a very rich cultural heritage, most of which is located in North Karnataka. I planned to visit the following places to fully utilise my holidays spanning three days :

1. BIJAPUR - Bijapur city is well known for its historical monuments of architectural importance built by the Muslim rulers during Sixteenth century AD. It is located around 530 Kms from Bangalore.

2. AIHOLE – Temples Famous for Chalukyan Architecture from Fifth to Eigthth Century AD. Located around 130 Kms from Bijapur.

3. PATTADAKAL – Magnificent temple sculptures of Seventh & Eighth Century
Bijapur, North Karnataka
Imbrahim Rouza Tomb
AD, declared as World heritage Site by UNESCO. Around 13 Kms from Aihole.

4. BADAMI – Cave temples carved out of caves during Sixth to Eighth Century AD by Badami Chalukyas. Further around 22 Kms.

I skipped Hampi due to paucity of time and also since I visited the place earlier.

My travel plan was as follows :

1. First day- to reach BIJAPUR and stay there.

2. Second day- start with visiting sites in BIJAPUR and then gradually travel to AIHOLE, PATTADAKAL depending on availability of time

3. Third & Final day- to visit tourist spots in BADAMI and coming back to Bangalore.

My immediate requirement was to look for a lodging arrangement at Bijapur. To my misfortune, despite continuous efforts for hours (initially thru net-booking and when that failed, thru calling over phone to no of various hotels (collected from sulekha.com)), I could not manage confirmation from any of the hotels. That did not deter me, I decided to go ahead with my plan.

25.12.2015

Bangalore-Neelamangala-Tumkur-Hariyur-Chitradurga- Hospet- Bijapur

(NH4 & NH 13)- Distance around 530 Kms

Thought of starting early morning (around 5 O’clock) but delayed to
Bijapur North Karnataka
Imbrahim Rouza Tomb 2
around 6.15 AM due to making all necessary arrangements. Previous night, I completed my essential pre-requisites i.e. filling up the fuel tank (35Ltrs required) of my car from the nearby Shell Petrol Pump, checked Air-pressure of wheels. Google Maps would be my guide for selecting the route.

Weather was cool but not chilly. City was slowly waking up with early morning laziness. Traffic was comparatively less, but only upto Yeshwantpur. From there, after driving for more than half an hour at snail’s speed, when I finally touched upon the lengthy flyover near Peenya, it was already around 7.15 AM.

There were two Toll Gates in the outskirts of Bangalore (Rs. 20/+Rs 17/-), out of which one was just after Neelamangala. I was amazed to see hundreds of vehicles waiting to cross the toll gates. There were seven-eight queues each consisting at least hundred vehicles. Many of them were cars with families and friends going out of Bangalore.

In my queue I noticed that the toll challan was issued by a person standing after the toll gate. While counting the change he returned one rupee less. When pointed out he returned one rupee separately. A convenient way to
Bijapur
Jamma Masjid
earn huge un-accounted income by the toll-gate personnel for each of so many waiting cars, since there was hardly any time to count the change returned.

Immediately after leaving Bangalore ,the weather became foggy and visibility level dropped. The traffic was considerably lesser. NH4 was a six lane highway and the entire road was beautifully maintained. At 8.30 AM I reached TUMKUR (75 Kms) and soon after crossed the next Toll plaza (Rs. 70). Thereafter it was a pleasant drive. I kept my accelerator pressed, and drove between 120 and 150 Km/hr and reached the fourth Toll Plaza (Rs. 55) at around 9.45 AM (187 Km) (near Hariyur).

I was not ready for what I was about to see next. Two young Motor Cycle riders were lying on the road in a pool of blood, with their two-wheelers by the road-side in badly damaged condition. From the look of it, they appeared to be from Bangalore, having possibly embarked on a joy ride. Both were badly wounded. Some two-wheelers stopped and tried to call for Ambulance/ Medical assistance, which was not forthcoming.

This incident helped me regain my sense of safety and need to drive carefully. I
Bijapur
Entrance Jumma Masjid
decided to monitor my speed (preferably not beyond 110 km/hr) and thereafter maintained the same throughout my journey.

Before Chitradurga I switched on my “Google Map”. Reached Chitradurga at around 10.15 AM (200 Kms). Taking right turn to reach NH 13 was slightly difficult since I could not properly gauge the map direction initially but corrected myself thereafter.

Since I would be driving alone, I was carrying plenty of snacks and fruits. I did not stop for breakfast (except a sip of tea in one of the toll gates). I decided to have a dry-lunch with my snacks and fruits only. This worked well as I managed to avoid a siesta which would be risky in a long drive.

After taking a brief rest the journey began in NH 13. Unlike NH4, it was a two lane Highway upto Hospet (around 130 Km from Chitradurga) with reasonable traffic (mostly trucks, large car hauling vehicles). The journey had been slightly painstaking, particularly in view of the recurrent trouble of overtaking large vehicles in a comparatively narrow road. Moreover, there were sudden speed breakers, mostly without any road sign.

On the way I came across a big market
Aihole, North Karnataka
Durga Temple
on the road side (around 80 Kms from Chitradurga) exclusively trading of sheeps and goats. Large no. of people, bullock carts as well as two wheelers were parked nearby. People were carrying animals in their vehicles after trading. It was a country market which was different, particularly for urban folk like me.

I also stopped near a Sunflower cultivation field on the roadside. Watching thousands of Sunflowers glowing in the sun-shine served as a welcome break to the monotony of a long drive.

At around 1.15 PM I reached Tunga Bhadra Dam (330 Km). The place was unique and worth spending time in. The periphery of the dam (on the left side) was so huge that the other end was not visible. The right side was surrounded by hills with railway tracks on the top. I noticed a goods train moving slowly on the top. Thereafter NH 13 became broad and after around a kilometre entered a tunnel. Hospet town came after few kilometres crossing the tunnel.

Immediately after Hospet, there were two Toll gates (360 Kms) one after another (Rs. 35/- and Rs. 45/- respectively). My destination, Bijapur was around 170 Kms from here.

After
Aihole
Durga Temple
Hospet, NH 13 (now a six lane high way) was a pleasure to drive.

Crossing three more toll plazas (Rs 45+Rs.50+Rs.70),I reached Bijapur (530 Km) at around 4.30 PM. The fuel indicator was nearing the danger mark, hence the immediate need was to feed the car. I did the same by filling 10 Ltrs of petrol from a small-sized petrol bunk inside of Bijapur town.

A brief history of Bijapur:

Bijapur city came under the Muslim influence since the time of Allauddin Khilji of Delhi in the late 13th century.

In 1347, the area was conquered by the Bahmani Sultanate of Gulbarga. In 1518, the Bahmani Sultanate split into five states known as the Deccan sultanates, one of which was Bijapur, ruled by the kings of the Adil Shahi dynasty for nearly two hundred years (1490–1686). City’s famous architectural marvels were built during the rule of this dynasty.

Although generally rivals, the five split states of erstwhile Bahumani Sultanete allied together against the Vijayanagara Empire of Hampi, the last and only famed Hindu dynasty of South India in 1565. The battle of Talkota was won by the Muslim forces , permanently weakening Vijayanagar Kingdom and finally culminated in its end
Aihole
Wall Sculpture Durga - Durga Temple
after a few years.

But it resulted in further strengthening Adil Shah Dynasty. During the rule of Mohammad Adil Shah (1627-1657) the boundary of Bijapur state extended as far as Bangalore.

The Sultanate was damaged by the revolt of Shivaji, whose father was Maratha commander of Adil Shah regiment.

The rule of Adil Shah dynasty ended in 1686, when Bijapur was conquered during the reign of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.Although the Mughals destroyed the Adilshahi, it was Shivaji's revolt which weakened the Adilshahi control.

Coming back to the present :

I tried to look for a lodging near the bus stand. I approached “Hotel Lalit Mahal” adjacent to the bus-stop and luckily got accommodation.

The hotel mainly caters to the long-distance bus passengers who need overnight halt in a boarding place near the bus stand. The tariff was quite reasonable (Rs 750/- per night for a double bed room, far less than other well-known hotels shown in various web-sites). The rooms were ok for a night’s halt. Futhermore, it had parking facility. It fulfilled all my basic requirements.

Despite having great historical significance and being the centre of humongous and beautiful Muslim Architecture, the present
Aihole
Wall sculpture of Durga - Durga Temple
Bijapur looked dirty compared to other Karnataka Tourist places, as if time stood still there. There seems to be less publicity also compared to other tourist spots.

I had dinner at “Kamat Hotel”. Despite its brand name, the quality of food was not upto the mark.

26.12.2015

After taking breakfast I checked out from the hotel. My program was to visit the important tourist places in Bijapur first and then proceed for the next destination.

My morning visit commenced with “Barah Kaman” then to “Jami Masjid” located nearby. The Barah Kaman was in ruins and did not look to be impressive, wheras the “Jami Masjid” was a must see.

JAMI MASJID

It is the largest and oldest mosque in South India. Ali Adil Shah I, after his triumphant victory over Vijayanagara built this mosque. This wonderful place of worship is a brilliant piece of architecture and a must visit in Bijapur.

GOL GOMBUZ

It is the largest dome ever built in India and second largest in the world, next in size only to St Peter's Basilica in Rome. It is the tomb of Mohammed Adil Shah (ruled 1627-1657) and construction ended in 1656.Adil
Aihole
Love eternal - Durga Temple
Shah was buried in the vast vault, beneath the floor of the hall.

I was surprised to note the respect and love given by the king to his mistress (Ramba) who lied on the one side of the king’s tomb along with his wives. Definitely he had a great heart.

The tomb is an example of architectural glory with its magnificent large 'whispering gallery'. Gol Gumbaz is a fine piece of Islamic architectural style.

The tomb was located near the Railway station and opens at early morning.

The archaeological museum was located inside the compound and worth visiting. The paintings of the Battle of Talkota (fought with Vijayanagara Kingdom) were exhibited in the Archaeological Museum, Bijapur. One picture showing beheading the defeated Vilayanagar King was striking.

TOMB OF IBRAHIM ROUZA

Built in 1627 it comprises two magnificent buildings, one is the Mosque and a Tomb. It contains the tomb of Ibrahim Adil Shah II and his queen Taj Sultana. It was originally intended to be the tomb for the queen.

One important feature was that the design of Taj Mahal was inspired by this tomb. The look of the structure has similarity to
Aihole
Narasimha Avatar - Durga Temple
the Taj Mahal, although the Taj Mahal was constructed by Marble rocks..

This is one of the most beautiful monuments I have seen anywhere.

In both the places I took the help of Guides to understand the importance of these structures. Entry fee in both the places were Rs. 5/- + Rs 25/- for Camera + Rs 150/- Local Guide.

Interestingly I saw hundreds of school children visiting these places (even places of my subsequent visits i.e. Aihole, Pattadakal, Badami) along with their teachers. Probably the visits were educational tours arranged by schools in various parts of Karnataka and commendable.

City has many other historical monuments, many of them are in ruins.

I started my visit at around 7.30 AM in the morning and when I completed the visit of “Ibrahim Rouza”, it was already 11.30 AM. I decided to proceed to my next destination, AIHOLE.

AIHOLE

Visiting Aihole from Bijapur was like going back another millenium or so i.e. from 16th Century, back to 6th Century AD. Aihole is around 130 Kms from Bijapur. Initially I drove around 100 Kms thru NH 13 and in between crossed two Toll Plazas (Rs. 50-+Rs
Pattadakal, North Karnataka
Sanghameshwara Temple
80). After the second Toll Plaza passing a bridge near Almatti Dam I took right turn to drive thru SH 133.

While the drive thru NH 13 was excellent, the state Highway 133 was narrow and not well maintained. The area was near the Almatti Dam and rich in cultivation. I was coming thru interior villages as well as cultivated fields in both sides of the road. Without “Google Map” direction, it was impossible for me to locate my destination.

At around 1.30 PM I could reach AIHOLE. On the way I filled in 10 more Litres of petrol.

Brief history

Aihole was located around 500 Kms from Bangalore. It is said Parashurama washed his axe in Aihole after killing the Kshatriyas.

It has immense historical significance and is called the 'cradle of Hindu rock architecture’. The temples were famous for Chalukyan architecture dating back to a long period from fifth to 12th Century. There are many temples in this place.

Durga Temple

Most incredible was the Durga temple constructed around 8th Century AD. The temple was enriched with beautifully carved walls and pillars having various sculptures with minute details. The wall carving
Pattadakal
Virupakhsha Temple
of “Mahisa Sura Mardini Durga” was magnificent. The wall statue of Durga was almost identical to Goddess Durga worshipped in Bengal which was an integral part by Bengali culture. How it related to our Durga idol and reached distant Bengal was amazing. Other wall statutes of the temple were also simply outstanding.

Lad Khan Temple

The temple was built by the Chalukya Kings in the 5th century. The walls of the temples had beautifully carved stone sculptures. Ironically the temple was named after a Muslim warlord living here.

PATTADAKAL

Pattadakal was very near (around 13 Kms) from Aihole. I started for Pattadakal after around one hour stoppage in Aihole.

Initial drive was thru a narrow and badly maintained road (around a Kilometer) inside a village. Gradually the road condition was improved to some extent but still filled up with large no of patholes. Driving had to be slow and cautious. Surroundings changed after some time and there were long hills in the surroundings. One important feature was the colour of the hill stone, mostly pinkish. There was definitely a link between the nature of this stone and rich architectural environment in this place.

At

Sanghameshawara temple 2
around 3.15 PM I reached Pattadakal.

Located near Malaprabha river, Pattadakal is one of the world heritage sites declared by UNESCO.Itwas the capital of the Chalukya dynasty between the 6th and 8th centuries. The Chalukyas built many temples here between the 7th and 8th century. Pattadakal is a great centre of Chalukya art and architecture, noted for its temples and inscriptions. It is called ‘the Laboratory of Indian Temples’. One can find both North Indian and Dravida Style of South Indian Temple side by side.

One advantage was that all important temples were located within one area.

Virupaksha Temple

Built in eighth century, the temple was the largest of all temples in Pattadakal. I am not a student of architecture, but I must say that the brilliant sculptures of Nataraja and other goddess in the temple wall were enough to mesmerise even an ordinary person with no background in this field. Kudos to those talented craftsmen who made those outstanding creations with stone that stood the test of time.

The sanctum contains “Black Siva Linga” as well as a “beautiful stone large bull.”

Sangameshvara Temple

This temple built in
Pattadakal
Nandi statute - Virupaksha Temple
Dravidian Style by Chalukya King during 7th Century AD was the oldest amongst all temples here.

There were large no. of visitors in all those places enjoying Christmas Holidays, many of them were school children.

It was 5.30 PM and I started for my last destination Badami.

BADAMI

Badami was around 22 Kms from Pattadakal. Road condition was not good once again. On the way I saw the Pink Stone of the roadside hills becoming reddish with the evening sunlight, a beautiful view to watch.

Once again, I had no prior booking of accommodation. After trying a few hotels in vein, I was suggested by one of the hotel personnel to try at Hotel Mukumbika. I got accommodated (Rs 1450/- for Double Room, Single Occupancy). I was allotted a room at the Ground Floor Corner, since all other rooms were reported to be already booked/occupied. Room was clean although not matching with the tariff. Ok, I had no other choice. The hotel was having a separate parking lot where I parked my car.

There was no restaurant in the Hotel. Hence I had to dine at night at an Udupi Hotel located just on
Pattadakal
Siva Linga - Virupakhsha Temple
the opposite. The quality of food was not satisfying.

After roaming various places throughout the day I was very tired. Thus it was time to go to bed and gain energy for the next day.

A touch of History of Badami

Badami was capital of “Badami Chalukyas” during Sixth Century AD. This kingdom ruled Karnataka, few areas of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra during the period of Sixth to Eighth Century. The greatest ruler of this dynasty was Pulakeshin II.

In middle of the Sixth Century, the Pallavas (presently from Tamil Nadu) destroyed Badami (then named Vatapi). But the Chalukyas fought back and won the war against the Pallavas and their capital Kanchipuram. After the Rastrakuta dynasty came to power in Karnataka, Badami lost its importance.

The rivalry between two south Indian culture dated back to thousand years which was manifested in the conflict between Chalukyas and Pallavas.

I was advised by the Hotel personnel to visit the Badami Caves in early morning which I did. The place was very near to the hotel. Another advantage would be avoid huge Christmas Holiday rush.

Brief History of Badami Caves

There are
Aihole
Sun flower Blossom - On the way
four cave temples created side by side. The Cave Temples were sculpted mostly between 6th and 8th centuries. One had to climb to the caves thru around 100 footsteps. The panoramic view on top of the hill was beautiful. The hills of Badami Caves was on one side of a big lake. In fact the lake was surrounded by hills of pink colour stones. On the bank of the lake was the ancient Boothnath Temple.

Cave 1 was devoted to Lord “Shiva”. This was the oldest of the caves. What attracted me the most was the crafted sculpture of Lord Shiva with 18 arms depicting different dancing poses. Lord Ganesha was on the left side with dancing mood. The craft was one of the best and brilliance of the craftsmen was beyond elaboration.

Cave 2 & 3 was dedicated to Lord Vishnu. Several forms of Vishnu avatars are crafted in the caves. Lord Vishnu manifested in his various glorious form which were immortalised by the beautiful craftsmen thousand years ago.

Cave 4 depicted Mahavira and other scholars related to Jain Religion.

These four cave temples represent the secular nature of those rulers. “Intolerance”, “Secularism” are the buzzwords
BADAMI
Badami caves
and much discussed topic today. However depiction of the lords of various religions (Hinduism, Buddhism & Jainism) side by side together in Badami Caves was a glaring example of tolerance practised in India since thousand years.

Visiting all the caves took nearly two hours. I came back to main road and had small breakfast. There was a motorable road for going to the other side of the lake. But it was very narrow and stretched between dense habitats. I decided to visit there particularly to have glimpse of the ancient temples located therein.

There were no of ancient temples on that side. Out of that most noticeable was the Boothnath Temple. This temple of Lord Shiva was constructed right on the lake itself and excellent to watch.

Driving back to Bangalore

After having bath and checking out from the hotel I started my return journey at around 12 PM. Bangalore was around 450 Kms from Badami. The day temperature was hot but not un-bearable. During return journey also I decided to depend on Fruits and Snacks only to statisfy my belly with occasional stoppage in between.

Starting the journey thru NH 367. After around 50
BADAMI
Anantha Vishnu
Kms, Google Map advised me to adopt a shorter route. I followed the Google Map and landed into a narrow road. The road was full of Potholes and not at all motorable. After proceeding few kilometres there was a bit improvement. Suddenly the Google Map stopped its operation.

Thereafter I had to drive considerable distance in an under-construction road. I was deeply concerned with the safety of my car, which was not equipped to face this kind of road. Gradually the road stretched thru interior cultivation fields on all sides and few interior villages.

The fuel meter was indicating need for filling up petrol at the earliest.

Totalling loosing the way, I halted to the next village stop. Despite having language problem they were very helpful. As per the villagers advice I had to change the direction of my car and to drive further. At around 1.30 PM when I reached Beur to touch NH 13 I felt relieved.

One disadvantage of blindly following the Google Map was that the road condition had not been explicitly depicted or known. As such, there was a possibility to end up in an awkward situation which I experienced at
BADAMI
More images Badami Caves
the last leg of my journey.

I filled up 20 Ltrs of petrol from the nearby petrol Bunk and resumed my journey. Thereafter it was a smooth journey. I reached Hospet at around 2.10 PM and Chitradurga at 4.30 PM.

Ultimately I reached my home in Bangalore at around 9 PM. Over all I travelled around 1170 Kms in three days and consumed around 65 Ltrs of petrol.

Total approx cost of the trip (except cost of food, Entry Fees, Guide Charges):

1. 65 Ltrs of petrol – Rs. 4300/-

2. Toll Plaza Fees

i.Bangalore to Bijapur – Rs. 417

ii. Bijapur to Aihole – Rs. 130

iii. Badami to Bangalore – Rs. 242

Total Rs. 789

(I hope I did not miss any Toll Gate)

3. Lodging Charges –

Bijapur Rs 750

Badami Rs. 1450

Total Rs. 10790

Overall It was a pleasant journey.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Chikmagalur
January 2nd 2016
Published: January 2nd 2016

A Good Vibe leads to a Good Start!-Sneha Marappa

Chikmagaluru has always been on the top list of my favorite places with the best of the climate that you can ask for, mountains stretching all around, waterfalls that you can see after every few meters on the road, fog that hugs your body with the chill breeze where goose bumps too would feel good. I would never get bored to visit this place; my friend’s call it as my second home but I call it just as home. I have been going through lot of blogs since many years and this travel blogger Shivya Nath is one of my favorites who had written about how to start solo travelling where she stated to start a solo trip with a known place that you are comfortable with and there you go, I knew which place to start with.

Been wanting to share this post from really long time but there was something holding me back, may be my conscious somehow knew I would be visiting this place again and again. After my first solo trip in February to Chikmagaluru, I went for the second time in March with a friend
2
of mine and for the third and last time just for this year (hopefully) with another friend. So here it is presenting 3 phases of Chikmagaluru!

Phase 1!

I have been to Chikmagaluru twice earlier so have pretty much seen most of the places around. As this was my first solo trip, I just wanted to feel comfortable in one place and come out of my hidden fears. I have always been scared of dark and staying alone, I really had to come out of that fear. One of my friends referred me to stay in this place, Devigiri Homestay, which had everything like I wanted. As comfortable as I want to be and as adventurous as I can be.

Tree house that I stayed in where there is no electricity, solar lamp is used instead and is about few meters walk in the woods from the main area. It was luckily a full moon night; there was moon light peeping through those tall silver oak trees. I managed to walk all through gazing at the moon by telling thanks for shedding the light while I walked!

These pictures are from a short trek that I went
3
through the estate I stayed in, got to witness the spectacular sunset amidst the mountains bidding goodbye for the day.

On the last day of any trips that I have gone so far, I have always felt wish I could stay longer. But on the last day of this one, I was very happy, there was a smile around me that kept saying this is not the last day, it is a beginning of many other trips in future. I made a promise to myself that I would never stop travelling and it will always or mostly be alone.

Phase 2!

Just like I felt there are many more to come, right after a month; a friend of mine wanted to go to Chikmagaluru. As it was first time for her, we had to go see the places around.

Mullayanagiri is the highest peak in Karnataka; it also has few caves which can be peeped into. It was raining when we reached there; we started climbing the hill to witness the view of the whole town. Seethalayanagiri is another hill which is on the way to Mullayanagiri. Baba Budangiri also called as Datta Peeta is a
4
pilgrimage site, there is a waterfall here called Manikyadhara falls which is a sacred place for devotees who visit Datta Peeta.

Jerry Falls is about 20 minutes’ drive in the Jeep from the main road, due to bad roads cars or any other vehicles were not allowed.

To wrap the day, we stopped over a temple and had a very good view of Devigiri Hills for the sunset.

Phase 3!

This was totally a different experience, it was the first time I was seeing a different part of Chikmagalur. A friend of mine who accompanied me is a wild life and nature lover and so am I; so I decided this time to stay close to Bhadra Wild Life Sanctuary. We stayed in a place called Nature Light Home Stay in Mallandur, a small village which is about 20 Kms from Chikmagaluru which is surrounded by coffee plantations. Nature Light Home Stay has the best food and best hosts I have come across.

Trip to Chikmagaluru without a trek is never complete; Kavikal Matta is a view point which is about 8 Kms from the home stay, can also be reached by a Jeep but we of course
5
preferred to trek. There are no rough roads or stones that you could see while walking but all you can see is a green carpet on all the sides you turn around. On the way there are lots of private coffee estates which you can run into, a river which is flowing by, small roads where there is no tar instead all green, drizzles dripping on you, fresh air that is not polluted.

This was the time when all our 5 senses were completely awake, most adventurous jeep ride ever with only rocks on the road and wheels rolling over them. Holding our breaths tight in the ride, we moving all around like a tide! This place is called Bande Kallu(Bande is rock and Kallu is stone), not to be exaggerating, once you are on the rock all you can see is 360 degrees of mountains all around.

There was only peace all around, it was too difficult to leave this place but had to bid a good bye. With global warming on one side, such places give us some hope that there is some way we can still sustain our lives for few more years.

I
6
always believed in this line “It’s the Journey that matters and not the Destination”; this was so true with this journey; Journey to this waterfall called Jagara Falls was just more than incredible. The drive is completely through the dense Bhadra Forest which is about 10 km drive from Mallandur.

With the bumpy ride on the jeep, trees all around, anonymous river flowing, peacock’s which are my favorite bird which was all around on the roads; they are all just a feast to the eyes.

There was this huge tree with a tiny cave in it J

Jeep ride ends to a point where there is a river flowing, from the river it is about one and a half km trek through a private coffee plantation to reach the waterfall. Leeches chilling on your feet tasting your warm blood, holding to the roots of the trees to pass from one corner to other, sliding through the mud and we finally reach the destination to watch the beautiful waterfall. Like I mentioned earlier, Journey to this waterfall was more incredible than seeing the waterfall itself.

This boy took us all around and made us feel safe in
7
the bumpy ride!

There is a very famous place where a lot of regional movie shootings happen which was our last stop for the day, yet again with a beautiful view of mountains and paddy fields.



Green on the ground and green all around,

You made us swirl like a cloud.

All our senses had its feast,

You are a beauty and the beast.

Slice from heaven that came through rain,

You make us fall in love again & again!



Blooming...

Ah quoi de mieux pour commencer l’année qu'une coupure d'électricité justement !

Ça faisait un mois qu'on avait pas eu de coupure d'électricité. En fait depuis qu'on a quitte l’hôtel ! Un hôtel pourtant 5 étoiles, dans lequel on est reste 3 semaines le temps de trouver un appartement. Mais cinq étoiles ne veut pas dire que l'on échappe a 3 ou 4 coupures d'électricité par soir, ce qui rend les conversations skype ou meme le visionnage d'un film, un peu complique. Et quand par miracle l'électricité ne fait pas des siennes, c’était l'eau chaude qui posait problème, ou plutôt l'eau froide en l’occurrence.



Toujours est-il, depuis notre arrivée dans notre appartement il y a 1 mois, pas de coupure d'électricité, rien. On a bien eu un petit problème de chauffe-eau mais après tout, 1 semaine après il était réparé, et puis on avait toujours les 2 autres salles de bain pour moyen de secours (chacune ayant son propre chauffe-eau).

Et puis soudainement, hier soir, 31 décembre, on décide de se faire un petit repas tout simple, normal quoi. On prépare notre poulet et nos patates, on met en marche la machine a purifier l'eau et on allume même le système d'eau chaude pour faire une petite vaisselle, tout ce qu'il y a de plus banal. Puis 20 minutes plus tard, sans raison particulière, coupure de courant. Puis le courant se remet en marche, et coupure a nouveau. Comme ça 3 fois d’affilé jusqu’à ce que cette fois le courant ne revienne pas. On ouvre le disjoncteur, tout semble ok. On désactive et réactive au cas ou il y ait un truc bizarre, genre une surprise indienne. Après tout ils vendent bien des aspirateurs avec des prises plus grosses que celles dans les murs (oui oui, on a bien eu cette surprise). Bref, on réactive le bidule mais ça change rien. On allume nos bougies, on appelle 3 ou 4 numéros jusqu’à joindre l’électricien. Parfait l’électricien arrive dans quelques minutes.

On est assis dans le noir sur le canapé, comme des cons, a attendre que le mec vienne, la bouffe est froide et pas cuite, le linge est encore trempe dans la machine a laver (elle aussi arrêtée en plein milieu), et on se dit que la soirée s'annonce longue. On reste assis la dans le noir, pendant 1 bonne heure. L’électricien ne vient pas. D'habitude ils ne sont pas ponctuels mais la, personne a l'horizon. Et subitement, le courant revient. Sans raison aucune. Je saute de joie retourne a mes fourneaux et rebelote, coupure de courant. Aude rit jaune. Le courant revient, je débranche le four au cas ou. Suite a différents tests je me rend compte que le four n'aime pas la prise sur laquelle il est branche. Ça fait des semaines qu'il est branche la mais ce soir, je sais pas pourquoi cette prise le gonfle et il ca fait tout disjoncter, quelque part, dans un lieu inaccessible et inconnu.. Aujourd'hui c'est pas le cas, il est de retour sur sa prise, mais probablement que le 31 decembre c'est un jour qui lui rappelle des mauvais souvenirs. On n'a pas voulu le contrarie, alors on l'a change de prise juste pour cette fois la.



Finalement la soiree n'a pas ete si longue que ca !



Tout ca pour dire qu'en Inde, y a toujours un petit truc pour te rappeler a l'ordre. Que ce soit dans un hotel 5 etoiles, au centre commerciale (pratique pour conserver la chaine de froid), ou chez toi, tu es en Inde et la vie te le rappelle. Que ce soit l'electricite ou autre chose. Oublie ta routine car ca n'existe pas !



Mais bon c'est cool quand meme, a cote de ca y a des avantages. On sort du mois le plus froid (decembre) et on l'a passe en t-shirt. On va d'ailleurs probablement passer notre hiver a se baigner a la piscine.



Bisous et bonne annee !

Asia » India » Karnataka » Bijapur
December 29th 2015
Published: January 16th 2016


Ibrahim Rouza
Bijapur
We had chosen to come to the region of Badami after our time in Hampi because we thought that on this off the beaten track destination we will not have to struggle with accomodation. How wrong we were. It took us ages to find accomodation here. Badami was fully booked. Both, Aihole and Pattadakal are little villages that do not offer accomodation. Finally we found a place in Bagalkot which is another hour away from Badami (even Bagalkot was nearly fully booked). OK, we were right: it is off the beaten track hence we did not meet westerners. But for indians, it seemed like all inhabitants from Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, Chennai and Mysore together were on the move in this region including hordes of school classes.

The trip from Hampi to Bagalkot was pretty easy. We took a bus to Hospet, changed for a bus to Ilcal and then another local bus to Bagalkot. It took us 4 hours. We did not have a map of Bagalkot and not the slightest idea what this city was like. We just had the address of our guesthouse. It turned out that this guesthouse was in the suburbs of Bagalkot (a nice residential
on a horse-drawn carriage
area). We took a rickshaw and arrived there safely. And then the shock: we had booked in (and payed already - it was the only possibility to get a room) a shit hole! The rooms were really old, only superficially cleaned (surprisingly, the bedsheets and towels smelled and looked freshly washed) and the bathroom was filthy. The door did not even have a locker. We complaint because of the locker and got a different room which was slightly better. But there were spiderwebs hanging around the cupboards and on the walls - awful. OK, for this night, we had no other possibility - we had checked everything. If we wanted to see the temples of Aihole and Pattadakal again - we had no other possibility. OK, somehow we managed to calm our mind, just take it like it is for 2 nights.

After leaving our things in the guesthouse, we tried to find a place where we could relax over a cup of tea and later have dinner. We ended up in one of the best hotels in Bagalkot, the Shiva Shangam Hotel. It was not a cozy place, but enough to hang around a bit and have a
Nina among school girls
decent dinner. After a night in safe sleeping bags (we always carry our sleeping bags for beds like this), we got up really early and took the bus to Badami and further on to Aihole. The temple in this little village (oh yes, this area is the true rural part of Karnataka) is extremely beautiful. As we reached it quite early, the grounds were empty and peaceful. Visiting the impressive Durga Temple we agreed that it was worth staying in our filthy place to come here. Later we took a local bus back to Pattadakal. Pattadakal is known for its groups of temples which are collectively a World Heritage Site. The main Virupaksha Temple shows on its columns episodes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Also these temples were amazing and really beautiful although in the meantime, the hordes of indians and school groups had arrived. But we took our time and enjoyed the scenery. To go back to Badami, we squeezed into a completely overloaded minibus which was speeding from one village to another for 1 hour before reaching Badami (the trip was accompanied by VERY loud music). It was fun and the locals on the bus seemed to
Durga Temple Aihole
see white people for the first time in their lifes. We felt like aliens....;-).

In Badami we made a little lunch break and went for a nice Thali to the Mayura Hotel before we took a horse-drawn carriage to reach the Badami Caves. The caves and the views from the caves were really beautiful. But it was so packed with people, we could hardly talk to each other because we could not understand our own words. The many school groups were incredably loud and all wanted to take pictures with us. It was fun but after a while, this is really making you tired and we just tried to escape the situation. Finally we took back the bus to Bagalkot and went to the hotel for dinner before it was back to the awful room for another short night.

The next morning we took the first bus at 6 am to Bijapur. It was again a 4 hour ride with a local bus. By reaching Bijapur we were shocked. We have never seen such a dirty city in our lives before. There was rubbish all around, it was very dusty and men and women alike were spitting wherever
bull race in the streets near Bagalkot
they were standing. But by reaching our next homestay we were very relieved. We stayed in the Sabala Heritage Home . We had a nice, clean and quiet room with a big bathroom with hot water and a balcony (with a view over the fields around Bijapur). OK, maybe the city was not our favourite one, the homestay was nice, people really friendly and the food was excellent. On the grounds of the homestay there was also a NGO. Local women who lost their husbands are given work by producing local handicrafts. The handicrafts are sold in different shops around India. It is a great project and it was very interesting to see the work.

One afternoon we went for a walk around Bijapur town. Our first impression was right: this town consists of dust and rubbish. One can see beautiful islamic architecture all around the city - but the buildings, mosques and houses just stand there and are left for decaying. No-one is interested in them, the locals do not even know the names of the buildings. Often, we have seen signs in front of a building saying that this is a historically protected building and underneath the sign there
Durga Temple Aihole
is a huge pile of garbage. We were really shocked. The next morning before sunrise we took a motorbike (renting the bike was cheaper than taking a rickshaw and it was a lot of fun) to visit the famous Golgumbaz. The Golgumbaz is a mausoleum dating back to 1659. The towers are capped by an enormous dome. It is said to be the largest dome in the world after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. One can reach the dome of the Golgumbaz by climbing up steep, narrow stairs in one of the towers. Indeed, it was impressive! In the afternoon we visited the second famous sight of Bijapur, the Ibrahim Rouza. It is another really beautiful islamic monument. On our way back to town we visited some decaying mosques, the citadel and the central market. But soon we went back to our homestay. On our last day, we were just hanging around in our homestay. In the afternoon we left Bijapur by train to Solapur from where we had to change for a night bus. Some more chaotic travelling was ahead of us.

We had a difficult time with a lot of struggles in this Northern part of Karnataka
Durga Temple details
and we were really sick of travelling by local transports around this part of India. It is stressful, it is packed with people and all people are touching us, starring at us. No-one speaks english and we could not read signs on the buses. More than ones we were really lost. This does not make travelling any easier. We were hoping for some nicer areas to continue our travels. Anyway, the tempels and the 2 major sights in Bijapur were really impressive. For the first time we understood people who were really fed up with travelling in India........ It was taking out all our energy.....

December 25th 2015

How lucky we were that we got train tickets to go to Hampi before christmas. This was nearly impossible and I still have to thank this wonderful and patient travel agent in Agonda who booked us the tickets 2 weeks in advance. As it was a day train and only a 7,5 hours trip from Madgaon to Hampi, we did not care about a general class ticket. The journey was great and the landscape especially in the beginning around the Dandeli Wildlife Parc really beautiful. In Hubli a horde of army guys came onto the train. But they were very kind and respectful. The train was packed but the journey still pleasant. Arriving in Hospet we were immediately attacked by the rickshaw drivers who wanted to take us to Hampi. No thank you - the local bus is much cheaper, convenient and fast. Only 30 minutes later we were in Hampi.

Famous Hampi - how many travelblogs have we read from bloggers raving about this serene spot. About the special atmosphere in Hampi. Well, the first thing we noticed was: Hampi is packed with tourists. Mainly indian tourists. Well, it is high season, accomodation is hard to get and really
in a coracle over the river
expensive (especially considering what you get). We had booked 3 nights in a non AC simple room in Hampi Bazaar for 2.000 Rupees! Across the river, where we originally wanted to stay, everything was booked for the next 2 weeks. Cheaper digs were impossible to find (despite one wants to sleep in a shit hole). Wow - glorious Hampi. It did not start that glorious and peaceful for us. Later, we found poor travellers sleeping in restaurants for one night as they did not get a room. We were lucky though. But the cost of the rooms ruined our budget. Anyway, we stayed a fourth night at a different place. It was awful, but the only way to see all the sights.

After our bad start in Hampi we headed to a roof top restaurant to enjoy the sunset and the views. That was indeed relaxing and nice! For dinner we ended up in the Mango Tree Restaurant in Hampi Bazaar. It was very relaxed, friendly and had amazing food! So we came here every single night.

Next morning it was time to explore Hampi. As our room was directly on the path to the river, we woke
Hampi impressions
up at around 6 am when all the school groups and other people who slept in the temple (and that were hundreds of people) went down to the river for the morning routine. OK, we followed them (not for our morning routine ;-)), but simply to watch the happenings. Well, when we say morning routine - this includes everything! People were shitting in the bushes and in between the rocks. They were all taking a bath in the dirty river where big crocodiles are supposed to be. They were washing their clothes, cleaning their teaths and so on.... It was a big event and great fun to watch.

Later we had a relaxing breakfast in a decent rooftop restaurant. First we decided to get an idea of Hampi by foot. We started to walk up Hemakuta Hill from where one can get a nice view over Hampi Bazaar. Furth on we went to the Krishna Temple and as far as the Lakshmi Narashima Tempel. Back to Hampi for a late lunch and than it was time to hike up Matanga Hill, the best place to enjoy the beautiful sunsets here.

The next day before further roaming around Hampi
indian tourist with her son
we had an important task to do. Where will we go after Hampi. Later than the 26 of december there was no space left in Hampi for us. As we thought to travel to some remote areas we excpected to not face any problems in finding a place. BIG mistake! We wanted to stay in Badami for 2 nights - everything fully booked. A travel agent found us a room in Bagalkot and he was also able to book a long distance bus for us later on, as all train tickets for the next 2 weeks were completely sold out. No need to say, that the remaining tickets were not a bargain! We were a bit frustrated - where is the fun of travelling when you have to prebook everything? And it was really ruining our budget. But we had no other possibility. Later the day, it was Hampi time again. We rented some bicycles an drove to the ruins further away, like the famous Elephant Stables, the Lotus Mahal and the Vittala Temple with the stone chariot. It was fun and it was really beautiful and once away from the most famous temples it was a very peaceful atmosphere.
on the train to Hospet
And of course, we visited the Virupaksha Temple - the only temple that is still in use here. Lucky enough, we could join a wedding ceremony there! On our last day, we decided to cross the river to Virupapur. There is a totally different feeling on this side of the river. We were very sad that we could not stay here as we liked it much more. It was still busy and full of tourists but has a more rural feeling with nice views over rice terrasses and boulders. We had a relaxing time and lunch in the Secret River View Guesthouse with fantastatic vies over the river to the Virupaksha Temple. Later, we walked over the boulders into a little valley an further down the river to the next coracle crossing. This was wonderful! No crowds, just some climbers hanging around the boulders. The landscape was stunning! For the first time we realised why so many people rave about Hampi. When we reached the river again we crossed over in a coracle and walked back to Hampi along the river, visiting some more temples and ruins. We ended the day with another sunset on a rooftop and a fantastic
Castle Rock train station
dinner in the Mango Tree Restaurant.

Well, Hampi did not leave us speechless. It is not a MUST visit place for us although it is nice. Maybe the crowds were to much - but anyway it is very touristy. The landscape is beautiful and the ruins are beautiful - we missed the special spirit we heard about so often. We simply did not get it. We had a good time, it was nice to see all the ruins, there are some relaxed places to hang out and have a good time. But that's it. 4 days of ruins were enough. We were ruined ;-) by the ruins and the prices here.

So if you want to go to Hampi, do it. You will have a good time. But avoid peak season when you will not get a bed cheaper than 1000 rupees for a cramped room (if you can get a bed at all).

Curiously about what was coming next, we took the bus to Bagalkot? Never heard of this place? No problem, you are not alone....... That is our next blog.

On the way to Salem 1
OUR TRIP TO KERALA




Visit to the God’s own country by car was in our plan for quite some time. Dussera holidays during end October gave that opportunity. We (Myself and my wife Munia) were consulting various websites from the net to select the route. We visited Munnar and Thekaddy earlier around five years back. However Kerala is world famous for its backwaters. This time we thought of visiting the backwaters of Kerala. We decided to cover three places which are well known for backwaters i.e Alpuzah (Alleppy), Kumarakom and Kottayam in between.

These places were far away (more than 500 kms) from Bangalore. Moreover a substantial stretch was thru hilly tracks I.e Western Ghat section, since we would cross the Western Ghat mountain ranges. Hence we decided to break in-between. Another attraction was various off-season hotel discount offered by different travel-sites.

After studying various alternatives, finally we decided to visit KUMAROKAM with a halt in MUNNAR. ALPUZAH was near to KUMAROKAM. We would return thru Wayanad. It would be a trip of five days altogether. Google Map would be our guide to show the route. Most important was the role of the navigator (Munia)
Hotel Annamalai Udmulpet
to provide the direction, while I would be on the wheel.

Accommodation was booked in MUNNAR(22nd), KUMAROKAM (23rd), ALPUZAH(24th) & SULTAN BATHERY, WAYANAD (25th) thru various websites.



21st October, 2015 - UDUMULPETTAI



With tour plan finalised, we started from Bangalore at around 10 am. Delay was due to certain unavoidable pre-occupations in the morning. Last night, Petrol tanks were filled in (35 ltrs) and air checked of the car in the shell petrol pump near to our house.



Munnar was around 500 kms or around nine to ten hours journey by car from Bangalore. Today’s program was to reach Munnar if possible, otherwise to stay en-route at night and reach Munnar next day morning.

First one hour there was heavy traffic till we reached the first toll gate (Rs 45) to catch the elevated lengthy flyover thru electronic city. Traffic was occasionally slow and there were few crossings upto the second toll gate(Rs 25). We reached Hosur (Tamilnadu-40 kms from B’lore) at around 11.15 am.

NH 7 is a 6 lane highway and ideal for driving. Gradually we were passing hills on both sides as well as
Entering Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary
in the horizon. I was tempted to put pressure on the accelerator. It was a sunny day with beautiful atmosphere. We reached Krishnagiri (91 km from B’lore) at around 12 pm.

We passed a tollgate (Rs 60) to enter Krishnagiri. The six lane road was so smooth, the engine was joyfully acknowledging its acceptance. I could hear that the car was singing. The road was moving to the horizon like a serpent passing thru the glaring sunny atmosphere. It was a pleasure to drive.

Next toll gate was at Thoppur (Rs 86). Soon we were near Salem (Tamil Nadu). Surrounding nature with hills filled with green cover was excellent to watch. Slowly no. of windmills appeared on the hill-top. We were feeling hungry. The tollgate boy suggested Adyar Ananda Bhawan at Salem would be a good choice for having a good quality lunch.

Salem was around 202 kms from Bangalore. The restaurant was deep inside Salem city. We had to deviate around 1.5 km from NH 7 to reach our destination. We could reach our destination thru Google maps, but half an hour additional time was lost. However it was a good veg lunch, nice to enjoy
Forest Checkpost
since we were hungry.

We started from Salem at around 2.30 pm. There are various alternative routes for Munnar from here. One alternative was Bangalore – Dindigul – Theni – Bodi – Pooppara – Munnar route . As we gathered from the websites, road condition would be better in this route, but it was lengthy. We selected Bangalore- Hosur- Salem- Perundurai- Dharapuram - Udumalaipettai- Marayoor- Munnar route for our journey since this route passes thru Chinner Wildlife Sanctuary and had immense natural beauty.

There was some indication board to deviate from NH 7 towards Perundurai. Unfortunately we missed the board and proceeded further. I was little perplexed. But my guide (Munia) assured a better alternative as suggested by the google map. We decided to proceed thru this route. We crossed Namakkal (254 kms) and then Karoor (298 km). In between we crossed another toll gate-Rs.42).

From Aravakurichi (324 km) we took a right turn and entered SH 193 and then SH 84C towards Dharapuram . This state highway in Tamilnadu was a two lane road, but properly maintained except few places. We passed Dharapuram (370 km) and reached Udulmulpet (408 Kms) at around 5 pm thru Dharapuram
On the way to Maryoor
- Udmulpettai road. So far we travelled 408 Kms.

Munnar was around 90 Kms from Udulmulpet. However the next drive would be on hilly tracks and in dense forest areas. Hence we decided not to proceed further.

Hotel Annamalai (Rs 650/-) was a place with basic facilities and Parking lot. The allotted room was broad enough but Munia was not satisfied with cleanliness. Nevertheless it was ok for overnight stay. However need for mosquito repellent was felt.

On the way we noticed an eating place just in front of the bus stand. We started walking towards that to have food. Suddenly there was a big sound of applying brakes and we saw a huge accident on the road. Two motorcycles with pillon-riders collided with each other at high speed, possibly from the opposite side. Three or four persons were lying in the road in a pull of blood. Luckily, two ambulances reached the spot immediately and carried the victim. We had to appreciate the immediate response to medical emergencies which might save those precious lives.



22/10/2015 MUNNAR



A beautiful sunny morning. Today our route was thru Western Ghats and amidst thick
NH 209 Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary
forests of Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary. We started at around 7 AM in the morning. Filling petrol was the first requirement, since no petrol bunk would be available till Munnar, once we leave Udulmulpet. Munia was asking to fill our belly also, but I insisted to proceed without wasting much time. Little confusion regarding the route to be adopted, but Google map was the guide. Once we left the town, the scenario was changing gradually. Hills and greeneries were calling us. After around half an hour we came across the first check-post to enter the forest. We had to write our names, destination and car no in the register. Check post personnel indicated for some tips which we ignored.

Road (NH 209) was narrow and going towards the uphill. We entered the western ghat ranges and the forest. There are lot of twists and turns on the road. It was quite narrow and rough in various places. Natural beauty was excellent. I was careful in driving while enjoying the amazing nature.

The second check-post came after few kilometres. We entered Kerala. Here also we had to write our whereabouts.

Monkeys. They were in large nos., naughty and looking
Nearing Munnar
for eatables. While entering our details in the checkpoint, we were surrounded by monkey regiment. Munia was frightened. Luckily all the car-windows were closed. Gradually we entered the deep forest. Roads were further rough, going up hills, with no of hairpin bends. The whole environment was calm and cool with sounds of birds occasionally. We stopped the vehicle at one place for quite sometime to feel the quietness.


This forest has no of wild animals including tigers, elephants and defers. We could not see any large animals except monitor, squirrel and varieties of birds. There were lot of sandalwood trees as also rare medicinal plants. Any way our knowledge was little in these areas.



At around 9 am we reached Maryoor ( 45 Kms from Udmulpet ). It was a small hill station before Munnar. A beautiful place with shops and market as also lodging facilities. We had tea break and also to take few snaps. May be, we could have stopped here yesterday by proceeding further. After few yards, we noticed a Kali temple too. Munia went inside to see and offer prayers.


A good place to have breakfast was
Approach to Munnar 1
in our radar. We got that. A nearby Hotel named Sarovar was managed by a lady. A menu list was hanging with various Kerala food as also beef. Beef is a controversial item nowadays. However we observed that there was no such taboo in Kerala. We noticed that subsequently also in the later part of our journey. Hindus and Muslims, Christians all were co-existing and running business here in harmony. We had breakfast with Appam ,omelette and potato sambar (obviously with tea at the end). With burning stomach the food was extremely delightful.

Posters, hoardings of two well known political parties (Congress & CPM) were spread out all along the road-side. Subsequently we found the same in almost all the places we visited. We heard that Panchayat Election was going to take place very soon throughout Kerala.

Now we were driving thru sandalwood forest and nearing Munnar. Tea garden started in between.

Next stoppage was at LAKKOM Falls on the way to Munnar. We had to climb a bit uphill. Entry fee was Rs. 20. With monsoon just ended, waterfall had ample water. Large no. of tourists alighted into the water. Some of them were taking bath
Beautiful flowers Munnar
also. After a brief photo session we decided to resume our journey. It was already 10 am and we were getting late to reach our destination. We had a taste of green coconut water (Color of the coconut was reddish). Taste was salty. Munia was negotiating for a hat to tackle the sun, but shopkeeper did not come down to the bargain.

Before Munnar, Eravikulam National Park was also on the way. This is one of the major tourist spots in Munnar. But we observed a huge rush of tourists in que in the ticket counter. We left the idea of entering. Any way we enjoyed the forest and the bountiful nature in our journey.

Munnar is one of the most favourite hill stations in India. Located in the western ghatranges (around 1800 Mtrs above sea level) it is one of the most favourite holiday destination in South India. Covered with greeneries and tea plantation, it presents a spectacular view of natural beauty. Low flying clouds and pristine, mist-filled valleys made Munnar one of the tourist hotspot.

This breath taking beauty of nature was overwhelming. Various flowers were blooming with wide varieties of color. We saw green
Tea Garden Munnar
tea bushes, tea gardens with vast greeneries. Mountain ranges touched the blue sky. Small tiny houses were visible in the distant Valleys. This is Munnar. Nature has opened its bounties here. We stopped the car in various places. Each place seemed to be unique in its beauty. We both felt much younger. Photo session continued for long. We entered Munnar town at around 12 pm.

Hotel West Wood Riverside was selected thru Makemytrip (Rs. 2500 rental). Hotel was located at around a km from the central point of Munnar at the bank of Mudhirapuzam river. We were alloted a room with river view. The river was not very wide (like any other river in the hill side), but with enough current. We sighted motor boats sailing the river quietly, carrying tourists. The river took a nice right turn after a while. The water was crystal clear, as if the river surface was visible from the top. Mountains of Munnar stood tall on the other side of the river. Another noticeable point was that there was no construction obstructing the view. Thus the scenic beauty was wide open. A good location to enjoy the nature.


We parked
MUDHIRAPUZAM RIVER VIEW FROM HOTEL AT MUNNAR
the car inside the hotel courtyard. Front office reception was ok, but in response to the query regarding sight seeing arrangement they had responded that it was already late for having a day sightseeing (Rs. 2000 per trip) today. However they could arrange for night jeep safari at Chinnar wild sanctuary (Rs. 2000 per trip). The visit would be for around three hours beginning from 10 pm.

Our previous experience of jungle safari arranged by forest department in various forests showed that the probability of noticing large animals had been quite low. Comparatively private safari had been more successful (of course risky in terms of dependability).

We decided to explore Munnar on our own. Beginning at around 2 pm we reached the Mattupetty Dam on the Eravikulam Lake first. It was a huge lake with exquisite natural beauty and surrounded by hills. There was heavy rush of tourists enjoying the beauty of the lake and surrounding areas. On proceeding further passing thru the right side of the lake, we came across Echo Point and few other tourist spots. No lunch today except street foods at nearby stalls adjacent to the Lake.

Our final destination was the “View
MATTUPETTY DAM
Point” which was around 24 Kms from the lake in the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border and a favourite tourist spot to watch the Sunset. Sky was overcast, but we decided to take a chance. Gradually the route was going up-hills with narrow hilly roads.

We reached the spot at around 5’o clock. Vehicles are not allowed after a particular point. After that the walkway was extended nearly a kilometre or so with both sides going down at least thousand feet deep, as if we were walking on top of a hill. It was an interesting place but distant horizon was not visible since both sides were plunged in deep fog.

We saw a hotel (named Hotel Periyar Residency) in that place, definitely an ideal place for lodging. It was very cold (much more cool compared to Munnar). We refreshed ourselves with omelette. According to Munia the size of the egg was unusually large. Clearing her doubts, the shopkeeper ensured that it was indeed a chicken egg (and not anything else).

Munia was delighted to acquire the long-cherished hat at last. This shopkeeper came down to the bargain and the hat was bought.

We came back to hotel
Top Point Munnar
at around 8 PM. Feeling extremely tired Munia wanted to have the dinner in the hotel room but the food rates were painful. I noticed a Gujarati eating place on the way and selected the place for finishing my dinner. Food was served after a long wait nevertheless it was north Indian type, hence acceptable.



23/10/2015 MUNNAR- KUMAROKAM



Morning break-fast was complimentary. Apart from the quality of food, the most noteworthy feature was the location of the eating place. The courtyard adjacent to the restaurant was in an open area covered with glass-pane at the top. Enjoying breakfast therein with a magnificent view of the river, adjoining mountains and light morning sunshine was a delightful experience. In fact this was the best place of that hotel.

At around 9 PM we began our journey to the next destination, Kumarakom, which was around 150 KMs from Munnar. According to Google Map, the journey would be via Kalarkutty- Koothattkulam-Perumthuruthu - Muthalakodam -Thodupuzah- Kuravilangad-

Perumthuruthu - Kumarakom route.

We commenced our journey thru NH 49. After around half an hour the Map suggested for a shorter route. Near Ambaddy estate we took left turn.
HOTEL KTDC WATERSCAPES KUMARAKOM
This road was narrow with lot of curves and sharp bends. We were moving amongst large tea estates. There were lot of resorts/Home Stays in both sides of the road. Soon, a river emerged on the left side. It was accompanying us for next half an hour or so. There were localities in between and the narrowness of the road made negotiating with the incoming vehicles quite difficult. Ultimately we reached NH 49 once again.

It was already 1 PM. Feeling hungry, we had lunch in a place called Kuravilangad. It was a ordinary eating place with localites. We ordered two Kerala Fish Meals. Two /three types of vegetables were served without any limit, with Kerala rice. Vegetables were tasteful but the fish curry disappointed me.

Road was divided in this place. One road was moving towards Kottayam and another to Kumarakom. We resumed our journey at around 1.30 PM. After driving nearly one hour or so thru narrow roads as directed by my navigator (Munia) in slow speed, when we reached Kumarakom, it was around 3 PM.

Lake VEMBANAD is a huge fresh-water lake stretching Kumarakom and Alpuzah. This lake is at the confluence of three
KUMARAKOM BIRD SANCTUARY
rivers (Periyar, Meenachil and Pampa). Kumarakom is situated in the eastern coast of lake VEMBANAD. The whole area is a network of rivulets and canals. Boats are the main mode of transport. Taking the lake as waterfront, these canals constitute backwaters.

Another important feature is that the adjoining paddy fields are below sea level. The waterways are made by blocking the huge water thru barricades made of mud on both sides, miles after miles. It was a different world I had never seen before. I heard of similar place in Venice or in Bangladesh (Purba Bangla).

Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary lies on the prolific estuary of river Meenachil and embraced by lake VEMBANAD. Hotel KTDC WATERSCAPES is situated right inside the sanctuary. This place is famous for its natural beauty and migratory birds, particularly during winter.

We reached KTDC Kumarakom Resort (Rental Rs. 3455) at around 3 pm. It is a vast area within the bird sanctuary. The reception official informed that our booking was upgraded to lake-view room. We were pleasantly surprised to see the room. This wooden bungalow was elevated around 15 feet from the ground and was equipped with modern facilities but right into the
BACKWATER KUMARAKOM
nature. It was located in the bank of the lake VEMBANAD. There were several small-sized canals within the area and canal view rooms (which we originally booked and less costly) were located by the side of the canal.

View from the room balcony was exquisite. Varieties of fish catching birds were flying all around to look for prey. Occasionally the fishing boats and house boats were visible. We could see the vast lake meeting the sky in the horizon. Everything was calm & quite except the birds.

Reception person advised us to book for boat ride in advance. But subsequently it was known that all bookings for today were full. Ride could be booked only tomorrow morning. We thought of visiting the bird sanctuary now. From the entry point it was around two km walk. The entire stroll was between trees and plants. However we could not watch any migratory birds since this was not the season for birds arrival. Ideal time for bird watching was winter.


We thought of having the joy of boat ride. However house boat ride was costly. There are various kinds of house boats and the rentals starting from Rs.600
LAUNCH SERVICE KUMARAKOM
per hour. Cost further escalated depending upon the size, look, amenities and luxurious arrangements of the boat. House boat was very popular for staying amongst tourists but not cheap. We came across hundreds of house boats of different varieties plying into the lake and adjoining backwaters. Any way we had booking for boat ride tomorrow morning.

I read of a cheaper alternative in the internet. There are no of ""passenger ferries"" across different routes of considerable distance passing thru the lake. Rates are extremely low and one can enjoy the boat-riding experience at the lake. In fact it is poor man's choice of tourism.
When asked in the reception they could not provide the whereabouts. After several enquiries, we could gather the details of ferry ghat. It was not very distant from the resort. We decided to take a chance.
The ferry service was upto a place called Muhammad. Ferry service runs every half an hour. We boarded the 6 pm ferry. It was a twilight time. But the sky was almost overcast. The journey was between two points of the lake. Gradually the daylight vanished and the ferry boat slowly moved to its destination piercing
LUXURY HOUSEBOAT
the darkness. Small points of lights emerging from fisherman's boat were visible in the distant horizon. We were enjoying our journey, but a bit un-easy since there were few passengers in the launch and the destination was totally un-known to us.

After around half an hour journey, we reached the destination, Muhammad. The ferry ghat seemed to be recently renovated but had a deserted look. There was vast darkness of the lake except the lights at the ghat. On return we were the only two passengers in the entire ferry. Our adventure ended at around 8 pm. It was a nice experience.

Night buffet dinner at the resort was quite costly (Rs. 850 per head). According to me it was not worth it's cost despite having large varieties of both veg as well as non-veg dishes. There were cheaper alternative outside, but Munia did not agree.

After dinner, Walking into the huge garden within the resort was enjoying experience. There are nice walkways and we were tempted to walk.

It was 9.30 pm. I pulled the chair to the balcony and admire the dark nature with room-lights switched off. The entire atmosphere was extremely
KUMARAKOM LAKE VEMBANAD
calm and quiet. Few houseboats are seen floating in the lake.
Soon we were interrupted by various insects. It was time for a quiet sleep.

24/10/2015 KUMARAKOM-ALPUZAH




I woke up in the early morning. That was the time for birds. They were extremely busy in their routine activities. Sky was overcast yet again. Lake was still in a lazy sleepy mood with a mystic cover of light fog. I opened the glass door and noticed everything was wet due to mist at night.

Our boat ride would be from 7 AM (Rs.600 for one hour). Mr Mani would be our guide and also boat operator. He was a local man and a very friendly person. He operated our boat to the lake as well as nearby backwater. There were houses in both sides of the waterways and a dinghy or a boat at every house. It was as if we were moving thru the country road in a rickshaw, only difference was that it was waterways, not roadways. There are vast paddy fields at both sides. Interestingly, the paddy fields are below the level of backwaters.

Waters were restricted thru mud
ALPUZAH BACKWATER
barriers in both sides of the waterways, mile after mile. Was it natural or man- made, I have no idea.

Mr Mani showed the place where the boat race was organised every year during August. It was a major tourist attraction. This year the monsoon was less, affecting the crop.

There were large no of house boats floating. Many of them are fully AC, with dining table luxurious sofa-sets, placed in the front balcony.

We came back at around 8 AM in the morning. Breakfast was complimentary. With large varieties, it was a good refreshment. “Puttu” was one local tasty special variety.

Our duration of stay at Kumarakom was coming to an end. Now we have to be ready for our next destination I.e. Alpuzah.

We spent some time sitting in the garden in between the lake and our room. It was a memorable experience in Kumarakom. We liked the place.



24/10/2015 ALAPPUZAH



Alappuzah (Alleppey) City is an important tourist destination in Kerala. This town with picturesque canals, backwaters, sea beaches is described as the “Venice of the East”. The vast backwaters of Alappuzah are the
BACKWATER VIEW ALPUZAH
most popular tourist attraction. A houseboat cruise in these backwaters is a delightful experience. This place is also famous for the SNAKE BOAT-RACE organised during August every year. Tourists from all over the world come to visit Alapuzzah to watch the boat-race.

Distance between Kumarakom and Alapuzah was around 33 Kms. Commencing our drive at around 12 PM thru SH 40, we reached the giant Pallathuruthy Bridge to cross over Lake VEMBANAD.

At around 1.30 PM we reached our destination, KTDC Hotel Tamarind at Alpuzah (Rs 1200).

We booked this hotel also thru MakeMy trip. The room allotted was extremely small. Maintenance of the hotel was not up to the mark. There were barely minimum furniture inside the room. Even the room key was not operating properly. Despite intimating at the reception, there was lukewarm response. We were disappointed but there was no other choice.

The reception person was very much interested to arrange a houseboat trip for us. When we asked about the location of the jetty for availing passenger ride, he initially attempted to discourage us. Nevertheless we took an auto and reached the jetty. It was not very far from the hotel.
FERRY STATION ALPUZAH

There were ferry services commencing from this jetty to various distant places. We saw a launch about to start its voyage. The destination was difficult to pronounce and remember. However we understood that it would take more than an hour to reach that place. The launch was of two storeys. But upper deck was already full. Hence we had to contend ourselves in the lower deck. We occupied two window seats. The journey started. There were dense habitats in both sides of the waterways, large multi-storeyed buildings in certain places on the riverside.

Soon the waterway plunged into the vast backwater territories. We saw a large auditorium in a small lagoon, church, market, beautifully constructed houses all surrounded by water. The launch went on cruising from one point to another with several waterways in between. There were pedestrian over-bridges in waterways to move from one side to the other. We observed hundreds of houseboats throughout the journey. They were of different sizes, equipped with all facilities expected in a star hotel.

Like Bus-stop, there were four-five water-stops. Passengers dis-embarked and new passengers came in. After around one and half hour, we reached to the final terminus. The fare
LUXURY HOUSE BOAT ALPUZAH
was Rs 20 per head, meagre expenditure compared to the travelling cost thru houseboats but with fairly long duration.

After a brief halt, the launch began its return journey. This time we could occupy seats in the upper-deck. The fare was double i.e. Rs 40 each. Dam cheap once again. Today’s lunch was snacks and biscuits which we carried with ourselves. Once again we could experience the nice surroundings. This wonderful journey ended at around 5 PM.

We came back to hotel and refreshed ourselves with Coffee and tasteful Banana Fry. Next destination was to visit the Sea Beach. When we reached there it was almost Sun-set time. The place was full of people. Large no of shops were visible in that area selling varieties of food items, stationeries, momentos etc. No of Bengali Tourists assembled therein to enjoy the puja holidays.

At night, I had delicious dinner at the KTDC restaurant with “Kerala Curry Mean” with rice. It was a nice meal reasonably priced. Munia had to be satisfied with veg meal since it was Saturday (observing “Tirupati brata)”). The climate was humid and we were feeling very tired after continuous roaming from one place to
Beautiful Flowers Munnar 2
another through-out the day. Time to take rest as also prepare for tomorrow. Tomorrow we had to undergo a long journey to Wayanad, a distant place from here.

Hampi
Geo: 15.3333, 76.4667

Ah! Hampi! This is one awesome place to visit! In the middle of nowhere, surrounded by boulders and rocks, big and small. Two to three days is a good amout of time to see everything here. We arrived very early by overnight bus from Goa along with many other blurry eyed travellers. We spent the first day walking nearby and going up the hill for some superb scenic views.
There is also a tuk tuk tour available which most drivers will try to get you to do from the moment you step out of the bus door.
It's quite beneficial to do this tour as there is a lot to see and it's a quick way to get around. The price isn't too bad either for a full day tour. We saw many temples and even a half sunset at the end.

We also crossed the other side of the river and hired bikes to 'monkey' temple with its 600 steps to the top. It's a good little workout, especially in the heat! But you are rewarded with 360 degree views of this magical landscape. On the way back we chilled out at the laughing buddha cafe which has great
Hampi
views overlooking the river to Hampi.
We then took a overnight bus to Mysore for a few days. We visited the main palace which is quite impressive.

For one of the days we hired a taxi for a visit to Bandipur National Park for a tiger safari. It was an early start to drive the 2 hrs there. We got a private jeep, much better than a bus full of locals, and had about an hour and a half safari. We didn't see a tiger but we did wait at a spot for 30 min because apparently there was one about to arrive at the watering hole. But it never came. We didn't even see an elephant, only deer and a few birds. It was still fun but we just had no luck with the animals on that day.

It was a Saturday so maybe they were sleeping in!
On another day we went up Chamundy Hill by local bus for views overlooking the city. Unfortunately it was quite hazy and being the weekend made it very busy. One annoying thing about Mysore was that tuk tuk drivers and other people try to get you to visit silk and fabric shops
Hampi
and are quite persistent. We had to be quite firm saying no!
Our visit to Mysore had it's ups and downs so we were looking forward to a different setting as we took the overnight bus to Kerala to start a one week tour.

Hiesiges Fährboot
Nach ausgiebiger Erforschung der Städte, Strände und Berge dieses Landes wurde es Zeit mich ins ländliche Indien zu begeben. Der an Goa angrenzende Bundesstaat Karnataka schien mir dafür gut geeignet. Nach einer rumpeligen und daher etwas schlafarmen Fahrt mit einem Nachtbus (ironischerweise Sleeperbus genannt) kam ich dort in einem mir zuvor völlig unbekannten Dorf namens Hampi an. Dieser Ort befindet sich inmitten des Ruinenfeldes der vor 500 Jahren untergegangenen großen Stadt Vijayanagar, die zur Zeit ihrer Zerstörung 500.000 Menschen beheimatet haben soll. Typisch Indien hat sich in all diesen Jahren niemand gefunden dort aufzuräumen 😉 Das Ergebnis ist eine unwirklich scheinende Landschaft voller eigentümlicher Hügel aus großen Felsbrocken zwischen denen Ruinen alter Paläste, Tempel und Forts verstreut liegen. Das Ganze ist oft von Nebeln durchzogen und in ein seltsames Licht getaucht, das von allen Seiten gleichzeitig zu kommen scheint. Ich betrat Hampi zu Sonnenaufgang direkt vor dem einzigen noch erhaltenen und noch benutzten Tempel, aus dem ein eigenartiger, durchgehender Hindugesang zu hören war. Ein wahrlich eindrucksvoller Empfang!



Niemand schien es hier eilig zu aben. Alles schien so gemächlich voranzugehen wie der Fluß, der an dem Ort vorbeifließt. So wartete ich gemütlich bis das Fährboot langsam den Betrieb aufnahm,
Felsen soweit das Auge reicht
setzte ans andere Ufer über und suchte mir dort eine Unterkunft inmitten der Felder . Die dort versammelten Traveller waren eine bunt zusammengewürfelte und gemütliche Gruppe, in der ich mich schnell heimisch fühlte. Witzigerweise traf ich hier auch auf überraschend viele bekannte Gesichter, Leute, die ich zuvor in anderen Teilen Indiens getroffen hatte. Viele waren auch Kletterer, die eigens fürs Bouldering auf den unzähligen hiesigen Felsbrocken hierher gekommen waren. Die Tage in Hampi vergingen wie im Flug und waren aufgelockert durch Aktivitäten wie Klettern, Wanderungen in den Ruinenfeldern und auf den umliegenden Hügeln, Schwimmen am hiesigen Stausee und Motorradausflügen ins Umland. Oder man spannte sich einfach eine Hängematte zwischen den Palmen auf und las etwas. Am Abend versammelten sich viele von uns zum Beobachten des Sonnenuntergangs auf einem der Hügel und der eine oder andere brachte Instrumente mit, um das Ganze mit improvisierter Musik zu untermalen. So läßt sichs aushalten! Oder wie der Inder sagt: Om Shanti!



Gut erholt und voller neuer Ideen wird es nun Zeit mich von Indien zu verabschieden. Die verschiedenen Orte die ich hier besucht habe waren teils so unterschiedlich, daß mir Indien oft wie eine Vielzahl verschiedener Länder erschien und ich bin
Sonnenuntergang - immer wieder ein Highlight
mir sicher, daß ich bei weitem noch nicht alles gesehen habe, daß es hier zu sehn gibt. Aber es gibt ja immer ein nächstes Mal!

Happy Calf Getting Dinner
The last time we were at Pushkar, we received a message that Uncle Ray had passed away while we were traveling. We were sad to lose a dear member of the family, but philosophical about the cycle of life. To honor his memory we placed flowers in the sacred Pushkar Lake.

Four years later and here we are again at this holy place of pilgrimmage when we get a message from home that Uncle Max had passed away.

We made the decision to again pay our respects by buying flowers in the Pushkar market and placing them in the scared Pushkar Lake to honor Uncle Max. As we thought about the loved ones that had recently passed through our life, we realized we had also said goodbye to some other dear family members.

On our last trip, we received notice that Grandma Ted (Theola) had passed away. We missed her memorial service because of our travels and, therefore missed the chance to properly pay our respects.

Only days before we left on our last trip, Grampy (Grandpa George) also passed away.

The plan was made to honor all three of these family members at the lake,
Another Happy Calf
but in a highly spontaneous moment we drastically changed this plan and I am so happy we did.

For several days our walk took us on the southern loop of the lake where it is considered so sacred you must remove your shoes to even walk on the bridge. At the end of the bridge there are usually some devotees praying and some pilgrims preparing to enter the lake. We always lingered a bit at the end of the bridge becasuse this is where we put our shoes back on our feet.

On our last evening in Pushkar, following the same routine along the auspicious part of the lake, a woman offered to sell us fresh cut cane sprouts to use for an offering in our worship. As we did with everyone offering to sell us something, we said ""no.""

Then dad got the greatest idea...he suggested we buy the fresh foliage here at the sacred part of the lake and feed some of these hungry calves we see walking around town to honor those loved ones that we recently lost.

I just loved the idea and I am certain Uncle Max, Grampy and Grandma Ted
Hey Good Lookin'
would be so happy to know their memory meant that three hungry calves had a hearty dinner in Pushkar. I suppose I do not need to mention how happy those calves were when we spotted them, untied the greens and scratched their backs while they had dinner.

A very fitting memorial for people who we cared so much about.

Murudeshwar
Determined to hit the beach immediately after lunch, we left home by 5.30am. The drive was scenic with great roads Router: Tumkur- Davangere - Yellapur- Ankola - Gokarna.

Reached Kudle Beach resort by 2pm with a couple of breaks. It was a lovely resort with an awesome view of the Kudle beach. The beach is a 500m trek away which was fun in its own way. The first evening was just beach beach beach. Having totally fearless kids adds to the beach fun 😊

Bang opposite the resort is a beautiful hillock. We had heard that the sunset from up the hillock would be good, but were awestruck when we reached the top. The ocean view, the rocks, trek down to the waters and the entire green area left us spell bound and to top it all we were the only ones in the entire hillock. If you walk across the hill, you will reach a Rama temple. The ancient temples of Gokarna are a delight to any spiritual person 😊 The calmness and aura cannot be explained. We get a panoramic view of the Arabian sea from here and the Gokarna beach is just a few meters walk.
Kotitheertha at Gokarna town


Opposite the Kudle resort is a Shiva cave. The cave is small and dark and there is a 2500 years old linga inside. The cave apparently leads to Uttar Kashi. Filled with bats and just a small hole for sunlight to enter, meditating in this place would surely get you closer to yourself!

A few kilometers away from Kudle beach is Om beach. After getting used to the clean, calm, beautiful, less populated Kudle beach, we were not too impressed with Om beach and returned quickly.

A must do for old town and temple lovers is a visit to the Gokarna town. We drove to the Mahabaleshwar temple. The temple has the 'Atma Linga' kept a few feet under ground. Ganesha had saved the Atma Linga (worshipped for Immortality) from Ravana (you can get more details here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murudeshwara). Don't miss the Anna Prasanna if you reach there between 12 to 2pm which happens everyday for all!

The roads around the temple have the culture of incredible India retained and the architecture of the houses is beautiful. The roads lead to the Kotitheertha which is a pond in the centre of the town. A walk around the
Kudle Beach
pond is a definite must-do.

Murudeshwar is a 90km 1.5hr drive from Gokarna. You just reach there and a magnificent 125 feet Shiva statue awaits you! The Gopuram is 237 feet and there is a huge statue of little ganesha deceiving Ravana right in front of the Shiva idol. You must visit the place during sunset to see Shiva in the ocean background with the orange light adding beauty to the already spectacular scene. You can reach the Gopuram top via a lift and have a great view as well. The beach was of course crowded but the view of Shiva and the Gopuram from the beach was amazing!

Gokarna - Kudle beach is no doubt one of the best beach for people who love to go right in and enjoy the waves but the city's beauty is doubled due to its spiritual feel! Definitely a place we would visit several times 😊

Fish Thali
So even though I'm 5 months behind on my entries (I still have photos to post of Italy, France, and Spain), I'm trying to stay on of this trip. Also, my parents would probably shun me if I didn't share the pictures of all of my meals, which could end up being the whole trip anyway if tonight was any indication.



We took off from Dubai this afternoon and set off for Bangalore to meet my wife's brother, who has been working here the past 5 months. The 4 hour flight was uneventful, relatively calm and no hiccups along the way, which was good since my wife had minor nightmares that we'd be thrown back on the plane. Alas, we made it and after we claimed our luggage we found my brother-in-law amongst the throng of hired drivers looking for their patrons. We took a taxi from the airport to our hotel took about an hour and a half door to door. About halfway through my wife turned to me and said Dramamine would have been a good thing to bring. I had that thought about 20 minutes earlier as our cab driver had passed 15 people, braked
2
hard three or four times for speed bumps, and honked at everything that was alive. Once to the hotel, it was a smooth evening from there. We had dinner at what most people probably wouldn't call a hole in the wall type of place, though it was up 2 flights of rickety stairs which may have holes in the wall. The food was incredible as I had the fish thali, which was fried fish and a collection of other dishes as well. It was delicous though may have set a crazy high standard for food over the next week.





We go into downtown Bangalore tomorrow and the a wildlife sanctuary on Friday. No word yet if I can ride a tiger though I'm just going to assume I can until someone says I can't...

September 7th 2015

Sandstone temple
The initial draw for Mysore was the yoga (for P mainly). Apparently there are many yoga centres offering classes and some even offering courses. After getting the yoga bug in Indonesia, P placed Mysore firmly on our itinerary. Of course Mysore is more than just a yoga hub, it's a huge modern city; with wide one way roads, colonial style buildings, a palace and a large cathedral. We likened it to Jaipur when we arrived but far more cleaner and organised. Before getting here we pictured it to be a lot smaller and less busy. How naive of us. This is India.

There's an overnight train that goes straight from Hospet (near Hampi) to Mysore. We were on that train. But due to a major oversight on our part we had booked it only part way to Bangalore and had booked a separate train 2 hrs later from Bangalore to Mysore. We had no idea why we had done this, only realising our error as we boarded the train. We had 2 choices: We stick to our schedule and get off at Bangalore and wait for our next train OR try and stay on this one and feign confusion
Local street seller
when asked for the ticket...At around 7am the conductor came along and woke us out of our sleep to tell us we we're in Bangalore. P shown him our tickets and told him we wanted to go to Mysore. He looked at our ticket, wobbled his head, scribbled on his paper and then went on his way. We love the relaxed rules of India.

Looking through our guide book, there didn't seem like a hell of a lot to do in Mysore, and we were supposed to be there for 2.5 days. Also since arriving in India we learnt that doing yoga here wasn't as straight forward. Apparently its the more remote resorts such as retreats in the jungle somewhere away from any other hint of civilisation. Many of them being more like schools/colleges where you'd need a student visa to attend, not just a basic tourist visa! No yoga for P.

After settling into our fancy hotel (there is only one budget hostel outside the city, whereas we wanted to be in it) we stepped out into the cool refreshing air of Mysore. It wasn't cold by any means but the humidity was a lot
A grand catholic church
lower than previous places, which we were so grateful for.

Just around the corner from our hotel was a large cathedral (built in 1931). We decided to pay it a quick visit, as when you think of India, Christianity and cathedrals rarely spring to mind.
**Fun fact: The minister who married us back in England was Indian**
The cathedral looked pretty large from the outside and in good condition. It automatically reminded us of the many cathedrals and churches back home from stone structure alone. We stuck our heads through the door to admire the architecture inside as a service was taking place with hymns sung in kannada (local dialect). The inside was pretty much the same as any other church really, with pews on both sides and the aisle down the middle leading towards the pulpit.

We had barely walked down the street on the main road before a rickshaw driver approached us. He said he would take us into town for 20rupees (which a very good price for tourists). We asked him to take us towards the city palace, where all the eateries were. On the way he was telling us about
The palace draws its inspiration from many countries and faiths
how the people in Mysore were very nice, friendly and don't overcharge foreigners. ""Trust me"" he said. Stopping just outside of the palace, he started giving us info on where's best to eat, mentioning some silk and fabric market and the opening/lunch times of the palace. He offered to take us to all these places and more. We declined his offer and asked him to just drop us near the palace where we could get food. For some reason he started driving us in the complete opposite direction of the palace, ready to take us to some restaurant he mentioned earlier, away from everywhere else. Getting stressed we told him to take us back the way we came. It seems the trick here is rickshaw driver’s offer extremely low priced journeys but will then earn commission for taking you to 'recommended' places. Highly frustrating, especially when you are hungry but to his dismay we refused to give in and we were finally dropped off where we were asked to be. The only reason he did this is because we took his phone number with a plan to call him once we had finished (we certainly were no fool).

The grand palace of Mysore
Finding a popular eatery called RRR restaurant, with a very basic menu selection but offering a unique experience we took a seat inside. P ordered the veg thali meal whilst Chris ordered a chicken biriyani. All meals here are served on a banana leaf and diners are to be ate with your hands. P was served a poppadom, rice and about 6/7 sauces, Chris had his biriyani with 2 sauces. We were both stuffed after eating the mountains of rice they gave us but it was really tasty meal and cheap too.

After lunch we headed to the city palace. A fairly large complex with a fusion of Hindu, Islamic and English architecture. From its red minarets on the outside to the huge ceiling and wall paintings of Hindu deities to the bronze lion statues throughout. This place was truly grand. The original was actually made out of wood and burnt down in 1897. The building we seen today was built in 1912 by an English architect. We took the audio tour around the palace (free for tourists) stopping at highlighted points to get an idea of what we were looking at. Unfortunately taking photos inside is forbidden
so we don't have any snaps of the grandiosity of the architecture here or the lifelike paintings drawn from photos. The huge columns, the enormous chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, the stained glass windows and the burmese teak wood with ivory ingrained it, really shown off the amount of money flying around the royal family at the time. There was also a residential part for visitors to walk through but we gave it a miss. Palace fatigue.

We sat outside for the rest of the afternoon admiring the views of the palace and people watching whilst planning our next move. Both feeling slightly exhausted we decided we would cut our time short here and head to our next destination further south for some relaxation by the coast and the backwaters. The business of India’s roads and towns had finally taken its toll on us and maybe that short stint in Goa also shown us what else we could be enjoying in India. We somehow managed to find a train leaving the following day and booked it straight away. Despite reserving 2 nights at our hotel online, the manager was very kind and only charged us for the one night
Baa baa yellow sheep...
we stayed and cancelled our 2nd night with no fuss. After checking out he even gave us fruit juice, omelette, toast and a free taxi to the train station - all on the house. Maybe we should stay in hotels more often. We think the fact that P promised to write a good review for them on trip advisor also helped.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Hampi
September 4th 2015
Published: December 7th 2015


Hampi; described as one of the most bewitching and spell-bounding landscapes with sandy temples and ruins dotted across some of the most spectacular scenery. Now a world heritage site, but in its prime it is believed Hampi was once one of the richest and largest kingdoms in the world. Take that you other built up ugly capital cities. In other words Hampi is generally described as a place not to be missed on a trip to southern India.

Furthermore it was off the tourist trail of Rajasthan. Saying all of this, before we arrived we could not get ourselves excited for Hampi as we enjoyed our few days of relaxation in Goa and had seen enough palaces and temples to last a lifetime by now. Did we really want to see another one, two or even more? We just didn’t have the energy for any.

However we were right to visit. Hampi was truly magical. As soon as we set eyes on this place we were struck by the beauty of it. It was like nothing we had laid eyes on before in India or anywhere else. Once again I would say pictures and even words do not do
These children loved having their picture taken
this place justice. Either way let us try to explain.

One of the first things that caught our eye in Hampi was the unusual landscape. Piles of mountains were made up of circular round boulders, like very large pebbles. Some small, others giant sized, all laid on top of each other as if they were purposefully placed. These boulders looked dusty in texture and sandy in colour. They sat in contrast to the sharp blue skies and sparkling blue river that snaked its path through this heritage site. Then there were the bright greens from the rice terraces. It all looked like the perfect natural and calming environment, very quiet in places and far removed from the cities we had previously visited.

Plus there was more to this place than meets the eye. On second glance, located across the sandy boulder terrain were temples that blended so effortlessly into their surrounds. After all they were made using the boulders that surround them. Once you spotted one, your eyes began to train themselves and you could see one more, two more, and then many more revealing themselves.

Unlike the other grand marble and mosaic filled palaces we were
Stone ruins amongst the stones
used to seeing in Rajasthan, these were far smaller in scale. However you have to bear in mind that they are not a true reflection of what they once were (as after all this whole site is now in ruins). What remains is many smallish square structures with columns bringing the builds (very open in design) together. In some ways it reminded us of Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Bagan in Myanmar but yet still so different. Although the temples may be more impressive in the latter two sites the scenery here tops them both. It was stunning and came without the hordes of tourists you see at Angkor Wat.

Plus we were about to have another first on this trip as we were to experience an ancient method of travelling across water…









After arriving we decided last minute to base ourselves on the ‘hippie’ side of town. Across from the river away from the main clustered Hampi Bazaar with the maze like narrow streets sitting beside Virupaksha Temple. We were located in more natural surrounds - plus we had with a perfect view of the temple and the boulders
Braving the intense heat for some sightseeing
that dotted the terrain across the river. We certainly wanted calm and tranquil by this point. Guesthouses here were small and quaint all located down one dirt-path backed by many rice terraces and rocky hills.


After crossing the river by the small overcrowded motor boat (30 second ride) we initially settled at Nargilla home stay but after a few hours of no power we decided to move to Sunny Guesthouse that had 24hrs electricity thanks to a backup generator.

Sunny Guesthouse was initially on our list. However as it had a lonely planet status we tried to avoid it. Sometimes LP's suggestions take their LP status as all they need to increase prices and lower standards. Sunny guesthouse was surprisingly rather pleasant with circular huts. Either wooden or cement based and were quaint and clean with fans. All for 400 rupees. It actually surprised us how much room we had inside one of the circular huts (bathroom included). They can be deceiving from the outside.



The locals here were friendly and not too pushy, and the ones that could speak English made an effort to remember our names. One old villager with
IMG_7406
limited English asked Chris if he was from Japan. Haha not quite.

After getting ready, and waiting at the boat dock a group of children made a beeline for P and her camera all asking for their pictures to be taken. It was quite nice at first but then annoying to see some of the kids become far too aggressive towards one another so that they could have their picture continually taken. We did manage to take some adorable pictures though.


Most locals were friendly, however we did encounter a very annoying rickshaw driver. Once we had crossed the river he practically attached himself to us. We decided to go for something to eat hoping he would get the hint and so we could gain some clarity on our plan for the day. Sadly this did not stop the rickshaw driver from waiting for us. Slightly annoyed by this we told him where we intended to walk around today and would not be getting a rickshaw. After finishing our food and leaving, this rickshaw driver continually offered us day tours. We were as clear as possible when we told him we did not need his service
tranquil
and wished to be left alone. Nevertheless this guy thought it would be useful for his rickshaw business to them inform us he would be very angry with us if we proceeded to go with someone else. This really annoyed us but at least this would be the last of him we thought. Nope he was still following us. We stopped again to ask him what he wanted only to receive the response that he intended to follow us to ensure we did not get another rickshaw driver.

This guy was very rude and insistent. Despite being very frustrated by this point we decided to continue with our day and ignore this guy. We decided to go to the tourist office. Rickshaw driver nevertheless in tow walking behind us. When we entered the temple he stayed at the gate. In the tourism office (located in Virupaksha Temple) we found out they were offering bicycle tours around the ruins as the distant between them was not very far (despite what many rickshaw drivers tell people) plus we would be given a guide providing information on the history. What a delightful way to explore the ruins we thought to ourselves. We
Conical boats have been used for centuries here
signed up for the following day.



After exiting the temple, you’ll never guess who was waiting for us. That annoying rude rickshaw driver. We told him we had signed up for a tour and he began shouting and screaming in our faces. He then proceeded to call the tourism guide out of the tourism office for stealing his customers. We were quite shocked by it all and wanted to get as far away from this idiot as possible. As we walked off, a fellow guide told us we should report him to the police as it is not the first time he had done this to tourists and he should not get away with it as along with his threatening demeanour he was also shouting profanities to us (not in English) and the tourism office man.

As we walked away he did not follow physically but kept his eye on us. What a creepy experience, we were both shaken by it. Luckily we did not see him again apart from at the boat dock the following day but apart from asking how our bike tour was in an overly jovial manner he ignored us as he
Can you take my picture...eek
accepted there was no custom here.

Anyway less about this guy and more about this majestic place of Hampi. We decided that we would spend the rest of the day exploring the temples located beside the river on foot. As we followed the beautiful trail that snaked beside the river we came across some completely abandoned sites. We were mesmerised by Hampi. It was such a beautiful place. Thank god we took this trail on possible on foot too instead of the rickshaw as we would have missed the delightful walk beside the river. No rickshaws can travel this route.

Our surrounding was mesmerising and it was very tranquil. As we stopped at some of the many ruins along the way although we knew very little about the history of these abandoned stone buildings we were mesmerised by the whole setting of it. Not too many tourists at all and instead many Indian families walking this trail or sat down for a Indian style picnic bringing more colour to this amazing site with their colourful saris. Added to this was the odd monkey which did not seem to be too distracted by us at all.

circle of life
Just looking at the giant round rock boulders that were all precariously standing upon one another looking as if any minute they may topple. We asked ourselves how they came to be and later found out that there are 2 theories to explain this unusual rock formation.

The first theory many Hindu people adopt relates to a rock fight between two gods, leaving behind these circular shaped boulders. The second theory relates to natural erosion from the strong winds blowing sand across the rocks creating a sandpaper effect and rounding many of the boulders off. We’ll leave it to you to decide.

After lots of picture taking and as much sun exposure that we could manage we walked back towards the boat jetty. On our way we got speaking to the most delightful children, many siblings and cousins on vacation with their families. They were between the ages of 4 and 13 and could speak very good English. They asked us many questions about us and our trip and also told us lots about where they were from in Calcutta and Mumbai. Chris also proved to be one of the little girl’s hero when he spotted
P getting comfy for sunset
a monkey behind her ready to snatch the corn on the cob she had in her hand, scaring it away. This was a lovely past time here, as apart from that unfriendly rickshaw driver many others were very friendly.

On the morning of our bicycle tour we got talking to the rest of our group, a British guy living in the states, a mixed couple; German guy and Ecuadorian girl and 3 guys from India on vacation here. All very friendly.

The tour started in Virupaksha temple and we were given a brief history of Hampi here. Our guide explained that the Hampi site was built in the 14th century as a Hindu kingdom. Its main purpose however was the trade of precious stones and gems. This kingdom was very successful with many visitors from Europe coming across and trading for some of these precious stones. He described a scene of the main road (outside this temple) bustling with elephants, camels, horses and the traders that rode them. We couldn’t quite picture this tranquil place in such away and were taken by surprise by a painting illustrating a scene that once was. It looked like a
Looks like its waving to a friend
bustling area just like any other in India (far from what it is today) but with a very grand feel to it as all the buyers for the precious gems rode their highly decorated Camels and Elephants.

We were informed that this kingdom was very successful at the time. That was until the sultans from further south stole the stones and destroyed most of the temples only leaving a few standing. We were both surprised by the trustworthiness back then which led to such a steal. It was quite normal for traders to cover their precious stones with blankets alone at the end of the day before they went home and this was when the ransacking took place. They were clearly not expecting such an attack.

Although the attack was initially an attack to gain more money and power as the sultans were initially after the precious stones, as they continued to demolish most of the temples here it soon turned into religious fight between Hindus & Muslims. The fight broke out into a war and left Hampi abandoned for many years.

For us, one sad thing about Hinduism is that once a temple
Jump and wave
or statue of a god is destroyed you cannot carry on worshipping at that sight. Once damaged it is no longer a temple, it is believed the spiritual essence of the place disappears and does not ever return even if the broken temple/statute is repaired. It therefore becomes a monument. This site therefore has lost most of its religious significance.

One thing our guide shed light on that had otherwise puzzled us on this trip was the erotic carvings etched onto many of temples we had visited. Quite surprising to see especially when you take a closer look. Our guide explained that these images are meant to distract evil spirits away from something so beautiful i.e ‘the temple’. Okay that makes sense but I bet the artists had a lot of fun creating them though.

The same idea applies to the babies with black make up under their eyes and sometimes with a huge mole drawn onto their faces. We always asked ourselves why people could be so cruel to their babies smearing them with so much black makeup. Well all was revealed… the black make up is meant to protect the baby by confusing the
Scenic Hampi
evil spirits that the beautiful baby is not in fact beautiful. We liked this idea, although we are not sure about how far we would go in adopting this ourselves.

Over the 5 hours of the tour we cycled from one site to another (with very little distance between them) and were given some information on their history. One commonality between them all was the destruction of the temples, shrines and even the palace. The palace was a huge complex and with all the building knocked down you could only get a feel for it from the foundation of squares that remained on the ground. Such a shame. Apart from being directly in the sunlight, we enjoyed the bike tour. It was very informative illustrating key features and designs of temples you may have otherwise missed. On one temple there was a 7 animal figure made up of an elephant, tiger, rabbit, crocodile and some other interesting creatures. We would have completely missed this without our guide.

Along with this tour another enjoyable past time during the day were the few rides we took on one of those unique river crossing vessels. These were in fact circular
Smile for the camera
conical boats which surprisingly have been around for a long time in many Middle Eastern countries. Interestingly there is a new theory around the famous story of Noah’s ark which is not only significant to the Bible, but the Quran and Torah (albeit with different names). It is argued with some pressing evidence that if such a thing existed it was certainly a round boat. Interesting hey.

Our evenings in Hampi on the other hand were relaxing (after climbing a rock formed hill) and admiring the sunset (a must while here) or enjoying a beer and delicious curry meal from one of the roof top restaurants, chatting away to both Indian and International travellers here.

Before finishing this blog we will share a story that stayed with us. One we found out about by talking with a local about his life. After talking for some time, he shared with us that both of his parents had sadly passed away to cancer when he was just a child leaving him and his siblings to fend for themselves. Although he has grown up and has now left his home town he continues to support his younger siblings in education.
Cycling across hampi
What really surprised us when talking to him was that although he has managed to forge a way of life for himself and even his siblings, he will always be disadvantaged on one aspect of his life. Marriage. He is 25, the age many men and women start to really settle down here. His friends have already found wives.

However as it is common practice for parents to find suitable partners for you here in India, he is not deemed suitable by many potential women and their parents due to a lack of parental line. He is however on the look out though so hopefully he'll be able to overcome this hurdle in his life.

Children in orphanages face the same challenges although many orphanages do play a parental role when it comes to this to help their children and young adults move on. Really harrowing. Never even considered this possibility when thinking about arranged marriages.

Gokak Water Falls
It is dry and barren because of drought in North Karnataka (Adverse impact of global warming)
People who love to travel, keep their eyes and ears open for every opportunity. His/her friends know it all. So when my friend bought a brand new car and planned to travel to his hometown for his baby’s naming ceremony, I got an invitation to travel with him.

I started early from office so that we could reach his home. Along the way, we picked up his cousin and hit the toll road of national highway. We were travelling from Bangalore to Gokak via Dharwad which was about 500 kms. The roads were good and we hit 100km/hr. on an average. There were not many private vehicles. My friend was keen to reach early before it gets dark. Starting at 2pm IST (Indian Standard Time) from Bangalore, it was simply impossible to do so.

We spoke about family, office and work. The green scenery of paddy, sugar cane and corn was pleasing to the eye. The weather was turning hot as we moved north. I attacked the muffins, the corn chips and water. We tasted some delicious homemade laddoos.

Gokak is small town built by the river Ghataprabha on the leeward side of the Western Ghats. It has
Hanging bridge over Ghatprabha river (Gokak Falls)
one of first cotton mills set up by British. It uses hydro-electric power generated by the magnificent Gokak falls (Niagara of India). As the south west monsoons had failed this year, there was hardly any water. The rocks showed their bareness and sorrow. There was an ancient temple built by the Chalukya’s dynasty at least 500 years ago close to Gokak falls. Next to the falls, there is Gokak Cotton Mill estate with its own bungalows, staff quarters, social club, school, swimming pool, badminton court etc. It appeared to have been constructed by the British to take care of its employees. There is a hanging bridge over the water falls which allows workers from other villages to cross and come to work in the mill. Later we visited another temple at a slightly higher elevation. It was inhabited mostly by monkeys and a few priests. We visited the local town temple. After a lovely dinner at Gokak resort, we rested.

On the way to Dharwad, we bought some fresh regional sweets called Kunda (famous in Belgaum) and Kadardant (popular sweet of Gokak). Dharwad is a university town with many horticulture universities. It is also called the pension town of

Karnataka. Many academicians, intellectuals, artists and scholars including Gyanpeeth awardees settle in this place. At the naming ceremony of my friend’s daughter, only female family members (no males!) lovingly decorated the baby’s cradle with flowers and balloons. The baby was gently rocked in cradle and the names of goddesses were whispered in her ears by her aunts. The women sang lullabies and the baby, Aarohi slept off peacefully. We had a sumptuous lunch and hit the road to return to Bangalore.

In this trip, I learnt that people fight over petty things and associate bad luck with certain plants and animals. Perhaps, they are insecure, afraid and find blaming a plant a solution to problems. Also, with Re1/kilo rice that is being distributed by the government, people perhaps are not motivated to work and have a lot of idle time to cultivate fancy superstitions. I realized the bad effect of not having a purpose in life; to do something meaningful with time. The full moon in the sky seemed to wink at me in silent agreement. I was home.

Jungle Walk
Mudumalai Tiger Reserve
Dear All

Greetings from Mysore, in the Indian state of Karnataka. Just arrived here a few hours ago, and other than saying this just seems so far the most comfortable, swankiest hotel I’ve stayed in so far, I will save writing about my time here until my next. The reason is I think there is plenty to relate already about these last few days, and I will add my afternoon in Mysore on to my next blog entry.

So last up, I believe I had just arrived in Ooty, at the most unusual Mount View Heritage Hotel, wonderful faded colonial grandeur with absolutely zippo on the service-front. It’s a shame, as I think they could do so much for the place if they spruced it up a bit and added a few friendly faces, what with its stunning rooms and top-notch view over Ooty. Still, if they had done that, then it would have been way out of my price range...! I had a unique stay in the hotel, and indeed these last few days have been quite different to anything I had experienced previously in India. These were days of relative peace, away from the hustle and bustle
The Black Bear Family Close-Up
of India, cool temperatures with no need for air-conditioning, and a glimpse into the more natural side of India. At the same time, they have been a bit unusual in being off-the-beaten track, with barely another tourist in sight, and travelling around has been a little bit trickier. It does feel good now to be back on the tourist trail once again though, but nevertheless, I have had a fascinating few days indeed, and here I will tell more.

First off, I have to admit that in the Mount View Hotel, when evening came, my excitement at being in the largest room I think I’ve ever stayed in, with its antique furniture seemingly dating back to the colonial days, seemed to fade away with the light. The lodge is at the end of a 200 metre dirt driveway from the main road, with no lighting along it whatsoever, making for a very spooky walk to the nearby resort hotel for dinner and back again. But my first night there was even spookier. I had not thought, upon checking in during the light of day, that the place might be haunted, but as dusk approached I could think of nothing
Gaur, or Indian Bison
After squaring us off, this buffalo stood to the side to let us pass in our jeep. As we passed, we only then saw the other buffalo hidden in the bushes to the left getting read to charge us - jumping around in a circle and snorting like crazy. Very very scary...
else. For the first time since sometime in my childhood, I had to sleep with the lights on! And even then it was a light sleep, as I kept waking up every couple of hours or so to check that there was nothing there in the room with me. All that stared back at me was the smile of a traditionally-dressed Indian girl in the one painting, eerily hanging over the fireplace. It’s amazing what tricks the mind plays on you when night falls in a place like that, and I was glad when the dawn came again the next morning. My second night was a bit easier there, and I could make do with sleeping with only one light in the vestibule area on. There also checked in two other foreign travellers in the room opposite me, both from the North of England, and the gentleman actually being the Headmaster of a private school in Sheffield, not far from where I grew up – what a small world! The fact that I was not so alone in the hotel did make the second night a bit easier to sleep through.

Perhaps it was this first night of light

sleep, or the fact of rising to an altitude of 2500 metres so quickly, that my second day in Ooty was pretty drab and perhaps the first naff day I’ve had travelling. Still, one naff day compared to twenty fantastic ones is a good ratio to my mind, and it all adds to the experience. My first day in Ooty I had gone straight on a hike out of town, but my second I thought it might be nice to wander around town and see a few of the touristy sights, this being a tourist town after all. It was interesting to take in Ooty’s beautiful lake, marred by a serious fun-fair type of atmosphere and hundreds of vehicles and tourist minibuses, St Stephen’s Church built by the Brits in 1829 and housing a number of fascinating tombs and gravestones of many a British colonial army officer and his family, and the central area of town centering around the main junction known as Charing Cross. Lunch was also taken at the plush Savoy Hotel, and dinner at Domino’s Pizzas (more Western comforts…!), but I couldn’t help thinking I might have had a better day had I arranged a day excursion
Udagamandalam (aka Ooty) Train Station
No sign of the Toy Train...
somehow into the beautiful highland areas out of town, home to stunning lakes, forested peaks and traditional tribal villages. Ah well, not to worry. The day was interesting at least, and it was still a refreshing change being up in the mountains.

But these last two days have been just incredible, and as soon as I descended from the upland Nilgiri Hills area, I felt uplifted again (perhaps, then, it was the altitude…?). Taking a taxi from Ooty to a tiny forest outpost called Singara around 30km away took me down from the hills again, down the even more spectacular Sighur Ghat road. The road comprises 36 hairpin bends, and as soon as it left the upper plateau area around Ooty, there were spectacular jungle wilderness vistas as far as the eye could see. The lower the road took us, the more the sounds of the Indian Jungle took over, and I realised that this was going to be a very special couple of days. I just have to briefly mention two more of the memorable signs glimpsed down the mountain road. On every hairpin bend, there was an advertisement for an ambulance company reading “For a free ambulance,
""Charing Cross""
The name given to the main junction of Ooty
call…”. On just one of them, there was a sign that read “For a free mortuary van, call…”. I have yet to decide whether this was as a joke, or was deadly serious. Was it also for the dangerous road which negotiated extremely steep valley sides, or was it for the dangerous animals which inhabit the jungle? I am still uncertain. Indeed, stopping for a quick toilet break, a monkey tried to get inside the taxi but fortunately I had rolled the window up. Monkeys initially look cute, but when they bare their fangs you realise just how nasty they can be. And then a few minutes later after driving again, an elephant crossed the road merely metres in front of us! This was actually really quite scary, it just came out of nowhere, and then disappeared again as soon as it had crossed, before I had chance to grab my camera, or even to say “elephant!”. It was just huge, a male elephant – contrary to African elephants where both sexes have tusks, it is only the male Indian elephant which has them, females don’t, and for this reason the male is also called a “Tusker”. This was certainly
Ah, the Cow Chilling Out in the Street!!
Been looking for one of these for a long time...!
a huge Tusker, and my first sighting of an Indian elephant in the wild. Very exciting indeed!

The taxi driver dropped me off in the jungle outpost “town”, or huddle of shacks, called Singara, at the edge of the tarmacked road, and already deep in the heart of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. Mudumalai is only part of a huge protected area called the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, comprising Mudumalai in Tamil Nadu, Bandipur and Nagarhole in Karnataka, and Wayanad in Kerala, UNESCO protected and said to be one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. It also has one of the best chances in India of spotting the ever-elusive tiger in the wild, with Mudumalai being home to around 50 of them, the highest population density in the whole of India. So I was certainly hoping to see a tiger during my visit, and this was one of the main reasons I included it on my itinerary. At Singara, the owner of the lodge I had booked into, The Wilds at Northernhay, met me in a 4x4 jeep and drove me the final two kilometres to the lodge, along the bumpiest road I think I have ever experienced.

My goodness what
Mount View Heritage Hotel Entrance
Rather foreboding...?!
a lodge! Straight out of a romantic safari-based novel, The Wilds at Northernhay is based in a(nother!) former British colonial bungalow, and also doubles up as a coffee plantation. I had booked myself into the lodge’s stunningly sited Tree House, about ten metres up a huge tree away from the main building, with stunning, unparalleled views over the Indian Jungle. This place was straight out of the Jungle Book, and the first time I have ever been in proper jungle. It was different to the rainforest type of “jungle” which I have experienced in South America, Africa and South-east Asia, though I can’t really explain how – I guess the trees were not so tall, more spread out, and the undergrowth bush was much more dense. I could never really describe the rainforest as a jungle for some reason, but this place I could. I just spent my first couple of hours there on my Tree House balcony, just staring out at the beauty of the landscape, and wallowing in the wondrous sounds of the wild – the exotic birds singing, insects chirruping and monkeys howling, along with various other sounds in the background, particularly at night, which I have

Spooky corridor...
no idea where, or what, they came from. This was just pure, how can I put it, jungle…!

I was also amazingly enough the only guest there for my two-night stay. The morning I arrived, a group of 12 had just left, and after I left this morning, they had five rooms booked up in total for the same evening. But for these two nights, I had the entire place to myself. The owner actually said I could have any of the rooms for the same price (still, not cheap – I consider it my “splurge” during this trip!), including the luxury suite with its two bedrooms, sitting room, and bathroom (with a bath!), or I could stay in one room one night and switch to another the other night. This was very tempting, as they had a good choice of interesting rooms, including along with the suite a separate cottage, and a traditional mud-built, but still luxury, hut. However, I was most satisfied with the Tree House. Even though it sloped slightly, and even though it creaked all night, and even moved when it became windy, I felt like a little boy again up there in the trees!
Me
Sorry, I just think this is really quite a cool picture...! Taken in the Mount View Heritage Hotel
A wonderful two nights were spent there, although the second night proved a bit troublesome to sleep again, as just as I was dropping off there came an almighty scuttling sound from the roof, and then in the bathroom. When I checked, a chocolate wrapper I had just put in the bin by the washbasin was lying in the middle of the bathroom floor. I believe it was a monkey that had somehow entered through the gap between a tree trunk and the ceiling, so again I slept with the bathroom light on and with one eye open… I also packed everything into my bags again before I went back to bed, as monkeys have also been known to take valuables such as mobile phones, and goodness knows what I’d do if one took my money belt. After a short while though, I did enter a deep sleep, and woke up the next morning with everything still there, which was a relief. Still, another night in which I was glad to see the dawn…!

Anyway, I fail yet to mention the amazing safaris I did from the lodge. The first evening, after a visit to the local (domesticated) elephant
Ooty Lake
camp, I was taken to a place to the north along a tarmacked road, but still prime viewing area for wildlife. Spotted some beautiful beasts, including a herd of elephants hidden deep in the bush, chital (or spotted) deer, wild boar, peacocks, and my favourite for the evening: a small family of black bears, with a little cub riding an adult piggy back – very cute! A very rare sight apparently, and along with tigers, leopards and black panthers, one of the “Big Four” to spot there. Unfortunately the family disappeared very quickly, before I had chance to take a good photo – still, I include a blurry one that I took anyway, as it was such a great sighting!

My second day I had to wait a bit to see if it was possible to go on a “nature walk” as well as another evening safari, as it had been raining pretty much ever since I got there and including through the night. This made the area around the lodge, being untarmacked and undeveloped, very muddy indeed. I was told it would be unsafe to do either a walk or a safari when it is muddy, because if
Ooty Lake
you have to run then you would most likely slip, fall over, and then…?! I was disappointed with the rain, but certainly didn’t want to find myself having to run away from something only to fall face down into a muddy pool and have the thing catch up with me. Also, safaris here were very different to what I had done in Africa. In Africa, the land was just so open wide, the wildlife was comparatively very easy to spot, and was also easy to drive away from quickly as you can just generally drive in any direction. Around the lodge, however, there was thick and dense jungle, criss-crossed by very muddy, very bumpy dirt tracks, which you can hope to travel along at an average speed of around 5mph. I wasn’t too sure of wishing to encounter something big and dangerous when the driver couldn’t get away too quickly, so when the rain did stop and we were given the go ahead I was most nervous to be honest.

On the morning of the second day, I went with one of the employees called Babbu on a nature walk around the lodge, asking in particular to see trees,
Ooty Lake
plants and butterflies, rather than tigers, leopards and elephants, due to our travelling on foot (though I guess you don’t really get much choice out there…!). Another different thing about safaris in India compared with Africa is that the guides are not allowed to carry guns, they are prohibited in India. So, I must say I was rather nervous during our hour’s walk through the coffee plantation, but fortunately the only animals we did see were a spectacular group of at least a hundred chital, or spotted deer, and a family of langur, or Hanuman (black-faced) monkeys. And after a wonderful rest of the day chilling around the lodge all to myself, and on my Tree House balcony with the spectacular view, it had stopped raining and I was able to take the evening jeep safari around the muddy tracks of the plantation. Within five minutes we had made our first sighting, a gaur, or Indian bison. This was stood on the track ahead of us, facing us, and I was told it was male and showing signs of aggression. This is a massive beast, with huge horns which have very sharp points, definitely not something you want to get
Having Fun at the Fair!
Ooty Lake
on the wrong side of. After a while, it backed down and stood to the side, so the driver decided that then was the time to drive past it. It was only upon approaching it that we realised and saw that there was one more even more aggressive-looking male hiding in the bushes to the side just metres to the left of us, and as we passed it began to jump and toss itself in a circle, making very loud snorting noises. This was very very scary, I did not enjoy it at all, and the time it took the 5mph jeep to pass this snorting beast and its companion, both ready to charge at any minute, seemed to last forever. My goodness it was such a relief to pass by safely, and to be honest I was most thankful that for the rest of the safari we were only able to spot one male, antlered chital deer standing very peacefully on the side of the track, generally minding its own business. That was just about enough excitement for one evening for me. Unfortunately my viewing of a tiger in the wild will have to wait for another time. We
St Stephen's Church
Ooty
at least did see tiger paw prints, apparently only an hour old or so. When we got back, I realised we had pretty much done the safari in the area that we had walked on on foot (without any kind of weaponry protection) that very same morning. Wow. Perhaps I’m getting old, perhaps I’ve an overly vivid imagination, or perhaps I watched the “tiger attacks man on elephant” video on YouTube too many times before coming to India, but I think I feared the safaris at the time more than I enjoyed them. I do enjoy reminiscing on them now, however.

Anyway, and overall, an amazing two days spent in the jungle. This morning I said goodbye to my Tree House which had been home for two nights, and caught a bus to my third and final Indian state during my travels, Karnataka. In a place called Mysore to be exact, in the most wonderful and comfortable hotel with an array of fantastic hotel freebies including talc, matchsticks, “skin jelly” and a superb souvenir bottle-opener/key-ring (which I shall be using very shortly to help me open my newly-arrived, from room service, large bottle of Strong Kingfisher beer!). Still, I
St Stephen's Church Graveyard
The tombs and gravestones of British colonials
will save writing about my time in Mysore so far until my next one.

For now, I sign out, after some very enjoyable, often quirky, days of travel off-the-beaten tourist track in Southern India. I spend two nights here in Mysore, before moving on to Bangalore on Friday, and back home on Sunday to arrive at Gatwick late Sunday evening. I will most likely write once more, to conclude my trip, on Monday, from the comfort of my very own spare bedroom in my beautiful little house in Croydon. No doubt after having unpacked, stuck everything in the wash, had a beer or two, and a long, stinkingly hot bath J

So, until then, thanks for reading, and bye for now!

All the best

Roaring sea Gokarna
Karnataka boasts no. of splendid waterfalls situated in various spots of Western Ghat Region. Best time to enjoy the waterfalls is during monsoon. Last week the news of monsoon spreading towards Coastal Karnataka was highlighted in various media channels. We were in two minds, whether this would be the right time to visit that region, particularly by road. Ultimately, last Friday (19thJune, 2015) late evening,we made up our minds and booked on line accommodation in Jog Falls.



Day 1 - 20th June, 2015

Way to Jog Falls

Next day myself along with my wife and son started in our Car towards JOG FALLs. It is one of the highest waterfall in India (around 900ft) located around 400 KMs from Bangalore.Our destination was Hotel MayuraGerusoppaJogfalls of Karnataka Tourism. We started a bit late (around 6.15 AM) since the program was made suddenly and without much planning. After filling petrol when we reached near Yeshwantpur it was past seven.My wife helped to navigate me with “Google” and GPS in hand. My son joined the navigation occasionally.

Route Bangalore to Chitradurga

Our route plan was to reach near Chitradurga via NH 4 (Bangalore Mumbai Highway) then take
On the way to Jog Falls
left turn towards Shimoga thru NH 13 (Sholapur Mangalore Highway)and finally take NH 206 (Bangalore – Honnavar Highway) to reach Jog Falls via Sagar.

From Yaswantpurupto near Neelamangala there was morning traffic. After crossing the second Toll Gate (Rs 18, First Toll gate we paid Rs 20), no of vehicles considerably reduced and we could drive fast. It was a pleasure to drive through NH4, which was a four lane Highway and well maintained.

After reaching Sira (8.35 AM) thru Tumkur, followed by Patterhalli (8.55 AM) and Hiriyur (9 AM), we reached our first destination near Chitradurga(9.30 AM) where we took left turn after a lake and enter NH 13 (Sholapur Mangalore Highway). On the way there were hundreds of Windmills installed in the hilltop which provided a nice view.

Weather was cloudy with small showers in between.

Chitradurga to Shimoga

Felt hungry and finished breakfast at a roadside hotel immediately after Chitradurga town(10 AM). This area was surrounded by small hills with big boulders, no vegetation.

Road condition of NH 13 was not at all conducive for smooth driving. The road was getting broadened (two lane) for which construction work was going on
Jog Falls with dark cloud
at various places. Road materials mixed with rainwater made matters worse. Above all the road was broken in some places. Negotiating all these,when we reached Chennagiri (11AM) and Shimoga(12 AM) crossing Tunga River, already the car was very dirty with wheels and lower part becoming red mingled with debris.

Stopped at TungaRiver to decide the next destination. Crossing two three circles, few Medical Colleges finally touched NH 206 (Honnavar Highway). This road although not very broad but was well maintained.

From Shimoga to Sagar was around 90 Kms. Thereafter we entered a sanctuary. Forest started. Now the scenario changed. Hilly tracks, in between villages. We saw a big village market on the road including Fish market also.

Rain,Rain,Rain

After that, rain started. Incessant rain, as if the whole sky was releasing its deposits on our car and on the road. Car wiper at its maximum speed, Windscreen flooded with waterflow, only the sound of rain on all sides.

It was thrilling, may be risky, but we came to see this.

Entering Jog Falls

We pierced the rain and entered our ultimate destination for the day, JOG FALLs crossing Saravatiriver at around 2 PM(425
Mystic Jog
Kms from Bangalore, 106 Kms from Shimoga,26 Km from Sagar).

Hotel Mayura Gerusoppa Jog falls, Karanataka Tourism was well maintained. I came here around ten years back. It was renovated. Inside room was cosy and spacious. Most important,the falls were just in front of the hotel. Nice location to enjoy the waterfall. No private hotel was allowed adjacent to that area.

To our surprise we saw large no. of visitors who came by Bus, Trekker, Tata Sumo, Hired vehicle and of course private vehicles. These enthusiastic people enjoyed getting soaked by rain and of course the view of waterfalls.

Last time we went to the foothills (around 900ft) where the waterfall touched the Saravatiriver. But now the walkway was closed due to some accident. Thus it was better to enjoy from the top.

Lunch was not expected, but it was available even at around 3 PM at KSTDC Restaurant. Not very tasty, but there was no other option also.

Meanwhile the weather improved, the white lines became visible. We thought of visiting the other side of the river to have different view of the falls.

Two districts of Karnataka (Shimoga and Karwar) are separated
Fourth Source of Jog Falls
by the river. KSTDC Hotels where we were staying was on Shimoga District, while on other side of Karwar district only Government Inspection Bunglow and some private shops were located. Then we visitedthat area.

View of the falls was better from that side. Moreover there was walkway to go down to a certain extent. However it is risky since not fenced unlike from the Shimoga phase.

Intensity of rain increased again when we reached there. In spite of that there were lot of tourists.We spent there as long as there was day light . Had tea and small chat with shop-owner, then came back to Hotel.

Dinner we had in a nearby stall with fish curry. Night sleep was enjoyable with sound of the waterfall.

Day 2 - 21st June, 2015

Morning started with heavy rain. Falls were mostly not visible. The contest between “cloud” and the “waterfall” was in full swing. We thought of starting early but “late-latif” as usual.

After breakfast at KSTDC restaurant we bagan our journey towards Honnavar thru NH 206 and ultimately to Murudeswar.Meanwhile dark clouds covered almost entire place including Hotel area. Hardly anything was visible.

Murudeswar
View from the public balcony
was around 80 Kms from Jog Falls, Honnavaren-route was around 50 Kms. NH 206 which goes to Honnavarwas narrow but road condition was more or less ok. Honnavar is located on the Arabian Sea coast.We had to cross the Western Ghatmountains to reach our destination.

Heavy Rain with storm at the Ghat Section

Immediately after crossing the Saravatyriver in Jog Falls, thick forest started. A few kilometres later Ghat Section road began. The road was zig zag with large no of curves and it neededcareful driving to negotiate. All those were known, but to our disadvantage, heavy rain started with stormy winds. Heavy fogs made visibility near to zero even with fog light. Falling trees in various places narrowed down the road passage. I switched on all the headlights of my car while proceeding slowly. Gradually, we reached the plain land after driving around 25 Kms on the Ghat section. It was a breath taking journey.

Honnavar

NH 206 touched NH 17 after going further down. NH 17 comes from Mumbai on the North and goes beyond Mangalore on the south. Honnavar is basically a fishing port located on the Arabian Sea. We stopped there for
Raja & Rani two separate sources outof four
a while. The two KM long Honnavar road bridge on the way to Murudeswar is one of the longest bridges in India. The bridge is constructed on the Sharavatiriver near the confluence of the Arabian sea. The backwater of the Arabian Sea gives a magnificent view of the whole place.



Murudeswar

Giant Lord Shiva Statute& Temple

This wonderful place is the abode of Lord Shiva and located on the coast of Arabian Sea. The giant Statute (122 Ft) of Lord Shiva, one of the tallest in the world was built on a big rock on the seashore. The area has other beautiful statutes and the temple.One can directly drive near the statute or visit by walk. The area is well planned and beautifully maintained. There are no of hotels in the vicinity. The entire place including hotels belong to a private RNShetty Group.

Murudeswar Temple

As per legend, this temple has the linkage of Ravanas worship to Lord Shiva to acquire Atma-linga (soul of Shiva) to gain immortality.He was unable to do so due to tricks by other gods like Lord Ganesha and Narada to save the universe. On his failure,Ravana threw his
Ghat section from Jog to Honnavar
belongings in anger to this place. Original temple was re-built by businessman R N Shetty.Gopuram of the temple was more than 20 storey tall, one of the tallest in the world. There is lift arrangement for reaching the top floor to have abirds eye view of the surrounding area.

Stay at Murudeswar

We reached Murudeswar at around 2 PM. There was no rain, but sea was very rough and roaring. We selected Hotel RNS Residency Hotel for staying. Location of the hotel was unique since it was constructed on an area which was extended to the sea. Thus almost three sides of the hotels were surrounded by the sea. It is one of the best location I have ever seen anywhere particularly for staying on sea-side.

The hotel tariff was low since it was off-season and very few visitors were occupying the rooms. We selected a sea-side room on the fifth floor. However, the flip side was absence of proper maintenance. Furnishing, cleaning of the hotel were not of that standard. But definitely a great feeling for one day experience.

Rest of the day spent by visiting the temple, Shiva Statute and surrounding places and enjoying
Ghat section from Jog to Honnavar 2
evening coffee in the wonderfully placed restaurant surrounded by sea. We were standing at the front-side of the hotel where roaring sea weaves just few feets below relentlessly attempting to break the cement structure with enormous energydue to inclement weather. Observing from the hotel balcony that tonnes of water waves dashingbeneath the hotel structure in roaring defiance of destruction was a frightening but worth experiencing. Also viewing the sea at night from the hotel balcony was a memorable experience.

Day 3 - 22nd June, 2014

Way to Gokarna

Time for returning to Bangalore. Complimentary breakfast time of the hotel was 7.30 AM onwards. Previous night we thought of starting immediately after taking breakfast. But after finishing breakfast and check out formalities when we started it was around 8.45 AM, already one hour late from our schedule.

Weather was far better today. After expressing its anger, Sea was calm and cool today. Offered “pranaam” to Lord Shiva and our journey began.

We were in two minds whether to visit Gokarna, but my wife insisted that we should not miss it. For Gokarna, the route was same uptoHonnavar. Distance between Murudeswar and Gokarna is around 80 Km
Lord Shiva statue Murudeswar
thru NH 17. This road was quite good to drive with wonderful natural beauties on the way. After crossing Honnavar, Gangavalli river was giving us company on her voyage to sea. The river was in spate,a splendid view to watch on the way.

Gokarna is a small town, but we thought of visiting “Om Beach” first, which was around 20 Kms from the main highway, around half an hour journey. It was a pleasant journey with the narrow road gradually increasing in height havingseveral twists and turns. Around four Km away from the beach we had the first glimpse of the sea from the top. Sea and the beach were located around 200 ft down below, amidst hills in the surroundings. An excellent panoramic view to enjoy. Gradually we came nearer with Resorts and Cottages in between. The beach looked like “OM” from the top, a spectacular sight. It was around 11 AM.

We stopped the car and trekked down below to the beach. This beach was different with rocky areas in various places. Sea was once again looking furious with mighty waves falling on the rocks. It was wonderful to watch the big waves and beauty of
Om Beach Gokarna
the beach.

MahabaleshwarTemple,Gokarna

The Mahabaleswar Temple, Gokarna of Lord Shiva was auspicious and a must visit. The Atmalinga or Shiva linga is said to bestow immense blessings to the devotees who took even aglimpse of it. According to mythology, the deity was placed by Ravana when he carried it from Mount Kailash. The temple according to legend was originally built more than thousand years ago and subsequently re-built during Vijaynagara period. The temple is claimed to be as pious as the Shiva Temple of Varanasi.

Gents visitors have to remove theirbanian to enter the temple.Luckily there was no rush, we visited the Lord, collected Prasad.

Return to Bangalore

Now we had to start at the earliest for reaching Bangalore within the day. According to Google map, there were no. of routes for going back to Bangalore. I wanted to take the same route thru which we came here.But the map showed a different preferred route for reaching early. With some hesitation we decided to take that route . The distance to be covered was around 600 Kms. It was 12.30 PM.

NH 63 thru Yellapur,Mundgod and Bankapur

We took left turn thru NH
Om Beach Gokarna 2
17 for around twenty kms further down towards Karwar. Thentook a right turn to reach NH 63 towards Yellapur. Reached Yellapur at 2.30 PM. The road passed thru absolutely green forests in Western Ghat with occasional view of waterfalls from nearby hills. There were some risky turns but overall road condition was good. There was not much traffic en-route. We passed around 60 Kms thru forest&Ghat section like these.

Throughout our journey the “Google Map” followed thru GPS dictated us which route to take as well as the distances to be covered. Suddenly we observed that there was not enough “Charge” in our mobile. We forgot to charge our mobile last night. That was a big mistake. We had bought a charger to recharge the mobile from the Car itself. But when we needed it most, we found out that it was not working. So the immediate requirement was to conserve the charge remaining in the mobile as much as possible.

Reached Mundgod and observed Tibetan Monasteries, villagers and their habitats on the way. We love Tibetan food but there was no time to search for eateries.

Our immediate objective was to touch NH 4 near Bankapur.
Raja, Rani, Rocket Jog Falls
Unfortunately,near Bankapur we lost the way and erroneously entered a remote village road with large potholes. That was a nightmare and I waspraying that our car would somehow pass that road (around five kms) without any trouble.

Bankapur-Haveri to Bangalore (NH 4)

At last, near Bankapur we reached NH 4 with a sigh of relief. We had crossed around 200 Kms already. There will be another nearly 400 Kmsdrive to reach Bangalore. It was around 4 PM.

Immediately, there was a Toll gate atBankapur (Rs. 70/-). Afterwords, we passed at least 5 Toll gates (RanebennurRs 95/-,HebbaluRs 75/-, GuilaluRs 55/-,TumkurRs 18/-, NeelamangalaRs 18/-). In many tollgates they ask for exact change and then return one rupee less in absence of change. But had no regets, since we could cover around 375 Kms within four hours with one stop in between. As I explained NH4 is one of the best roads to drive. Around 8.15PM we passedYashvantpurRailway station and reached home at around 9 PM.

We drove around 1200 KM in three days. In between we passed dense forests, huge waterfalls, mighty rivers, twists and turns of Ghat Roads. We offered prayers in temples. We enjoyed vast
Raja, Rani, Rocket Jog Falls 2
areas of Western Ghat range and Coastal Karnataka. Above all we experienced rain and Monsoon.

A memorable journey indeed.

May 12th 2015
Published: May 12th 2015


I’ve been back on the land for two weeks and all kinds of things have happened since, but let me use this post to explain the few weeks I spent at Auroville.

After a few more days with the Auroville guys, I left with Ilango and Vikram in the Bolero with all their gear and we drove to Auroville in 10 hours. The trip was mostly uneventful as we listened to a broken Bob Marley cd with the two main highlights being another twister passing us on the road and a very, very tight descent down the mountains with 27 needle pin bends.

We arrived at the AV youth centre in the evening. The first few days there were kind of boring to me but then I decided to go out and explore on my own. Mostaba let me use his bicycle the entire time (thanks so much!) so I was able to go out whenever I wanted. I checked out the visitors centre first and got a very different impression of the place than I’d had from just being in the YC the first few days

In brief, Auroville is a town of over 2000 people that was started in 1968, based upon the idea of human unity, as described by two somewhat mysterious (or perhaps mythical) persons generally referred to as ‘The Mother’ and Sri Aurobindo. As such, there are a lot of people from all over the world (especially many Europeans) who have contributed to the place and have basically built a life for themselves. At the centre of Auroville there is a huge golden globe, called The Matrimandir, which is the symbol of Auroville and is a place used for tourguides and meditation. I guess occasionally ceremonies and things of such nature are held in or around as well, though I didn’t get to see any. Inside the matrimandir it looks and feels like a 70’s sci-fi movie. You have to wear white socks in order to keep the carpeted spiral walkway up to the inner chamber pristinely white. Inside the inner chamber is a huge crystal ball, and underneath the entire thing is a smaller crystal ball, surrounded by marble slabs with water flowing over them. I found it all both beautiful and absurd.

I actually kinda knew about a lot of this before coming to India as I had been referred to AV as a potential place for my placement, but the impression I’d gotten through various online sources made me think it was either a tourist destination or a place for seriously floaty people. Plus they didn’t reply to my second email... At any rate, I can say that my assumptions were misplaced and I’m very glad to have been able to go there for a short while anyway. In fact, I highly recommend anyone to visit and learn about an alternative way to life (it is apparently the world’s largest eco-village) and I think I would have really enjoyed interning at one of their permaculture/reforestation projects. There are literally all kinds of people there, including many volunteers and travellers passing through, even outside of the tourist season.

The first two weeks I still hung out mostly at the youth centre. It’s actually one of the most unlikely parts of AV. Although mostly inhabited and visited by Aurovillan teenagers, there were 3 other visitors staying there at the same time I was. The rent is cheap (200 rps plus some volunteer work per day) and so I worked a bit now and then on digging a pool, building a treehouse and a gameroom, together with various of the AV gang, as well as some European travellers (Aemon, Alex & Mihael). Every Saturday they have a Farmer’s Market and a Pizza Night at YC which attract all kinds of people. The first time I met some people volunteering at Buddha Garden who invited me to join them the following Monday. I also met some Norwegian students who study at a Norwegian university in Pondicherry and eventually went with them to a party there.

At Buddha Garden I met several of the people who had invited me, but I also met quite a few others. These people seemed far more interested in sharing stories with me and as time went on at AV the group seemed to grow larger as people mingled with one another and got more familiar with the area. I felt relieved to have found people who were in a somewhat similar place as me and could therefore connect with. I spent some days hanging out with various crowds, doing some work at the youth centre, exploring the area, visiting a permaculture farm called Solitude (where they host concerts and offer meals cooked with a lot of their own vegetables), the Matrimandir and so on. There was also a big meeting (about 200 attendees) I attended where people discussed the issue of building a road through a place called Pony Farm. Basically there is a masterplan for Auroville’s development, which doesn’t seem to take into account the community of people already living there. It was very interesting to see how the whole meeting was set up and I thought the facilitator did a great job of giving everyone a chance to talk. Unfortunately I was unable to visit Pony Farm.

Then on Friday I met up with Lev and Lucie to go to the Pebble Garden tour. Since I was the only one on a bicycle I quickly had to learn how to drive a TVS (a small scooter with no gears) which was no problem. The tour was really great! Basically Pebble Garden is one of several reforestation projects that have been going on at and around Auroville in the past 20-30 years. The main person, Bernard, is a very excited storyteller and explained the history of the place before we went out to have a look around. They use an interesting technique for their garden beds, mimicking the behaviour of termites to create nutrient-rich soil. I also learnt that the entire area used to be a forests, before the British and French cut down all the trees and the topsoil was washed away into the Bay of Bengal, turning the area into a desert. Thanks to the efforts of people like Bernard, Auroville is now a very forested area with lots of shade. The weather is a bit different than at Swayyam. It’s very humid and quite exhausting, especially with having to use a bicycle most of the time.

The next day I met up with some Buddha Garden people at one of the lodging areas, called Reve and met an American girl named Madi and everything changed. We went to a lake and things clicked so we hung out at the pizza night at the youth centre. After that we hung out every day and had amazing times together. I drove her TVS all over the place which was awesome until one night when we had way too many problems with getting several TVS’s to start. After that night I couldn’t help but feel sad at the thought that it would all be over soon, but this prompted me to make the most of our last few days and change my attitude. We drove to Pondicherry the next day and had a great time, taking rickshaws and walking around the Botanical Gardens (featured briefly in The Life Of Pi) before getting my busticket for the coming Saturday. It’s really helpful to have someone around who’s more familiar with the way things work in India (haggling with the rickshaw drivers especially).

The next Friday I visited Pebble Garden again to get some seeds from Bernard for Malvikaa and after that I went with Paul (a German guy I met) to the Sadhana Forest tour. Sadhana Forest is an all-vegan reforestation/restoration project with over 1000 volunteers per year. I didn't like the tour as much as Bernard’s but it was still good to see everything and afterwards there were several videos explaining their projects (also in Kenya, Haiti and another location in India) and then we watched the first part of a documentary on all kinds of issues mankind is experiencing nowadays. It was inspiring but tiring. Afterwards we went to Brother’s Pizza place where we met up with Madi and Cris.



The last day I hung out with Madi before the taxi showed up at the Youth Centre to take me away to the Pondicherry bus station. Reluctantly I got in after saying my goodbyes. The bus left at 11pm to arrive at Bangalore around 6am the next day. It was a bumpy ride and the guy next to me kept nodding off on my shoulder. Needless to say, I didn’t sleep much. When I got to Bangalore I tried to get a rickshaw driver to take me to the train station so I could get to Mysore the way Madi had advised, but instead he argued I should take a taxi. I was tired and in no mood to argue so I figured I would check out how much it would be. 150 rupees to get to Mysore is not a whole lot of money so I took the taxi (which fit 10 people) and got to Mysore about 3 hours later. I thought of doing some sight-seeing in Mysore but touristing with my house on my back and lack of sleep didn’t seem like a fun idea so instead I went to a hotel where they had wifi and I could charge my laptop and phone. They treated me like a special customer, even going so far as to tell the guy who was on the toilet to hurry up since I needed to go. I got to the bus station and then took a bus to Gundlupet and then to Yelachatti where I arrived around 4.30pm, feeling very alone. The land had gotten very green and beautiful though and it was clear I was in for the next stage of my stay in India.

On the Way
Wide empty road- can't imagine in the city.
Goa is a known name to Domestic and Overseas travelers. It has one of the finest beaches of India and many old age churches. The carefree and lively atmosphere, mouth watering Sea food delicacies, Casino parlors, Jewellery are some of the attractions.

Generally I do a kind of research when I visit any place. But when I visited Goa for the first time in April 2014, I had nothing to research before the visit. Because I might be the only first time visitor to the place among my known circle. In fact it was just a much awaited trip for my son.

So, to give a bit of excitement to the trip, we decided to drive down. So that we could stop wherever we wanted, could eat at our choice of eatery and could leisurely spend time on the roadside.

We started our journey at around 6am in the morning. It took one hour to cross the city including a railway crossing which itself took 30mins to cross.

It is always eye soothing to go out of the city; then only we can enjoy the real beauty of nature.

Bangalore is a city of lakes and
Greenery
Eye soothing view
greenery. We can see trees on both sides of the roads many times the top of the trees kissing each other making a complete shade over the busy roads, being having awesome weather throughout the year some trees are always laden with beautiful flowers. But the population, high rise buildings, pollution has shielded the natural beauty.

But, once we crossed the busiest and newly developed part of the city, we could see double storied traditional houses painted with bright yellow, blue and other colors separated by a patch of greenery from the neighboring house. There was breathing space for every house, many has small garden at the front.

As we further moved we could see houses with more open areas, temples. The temple of each state and region is uniquely different in India. In the southern states, the outer wall of the temple building also has different sizes idols built on it.

We stopped for breakfast at a famous south Indian food chain joint. We always prefer to have local cuisine. We were required to cover 12 hours journey hence, had quite heavy breakfast of Idli and Dosa.

Now we were quite out of the city
Masala Dosa
South Indian delicacy
and could see small hills, wind mills, power stations at the foothills, long stretch of dry fields. The memories of these natural beauty remains in the heart and mind for long and gives us enthusiasm to go back to our work of daily life and makes our wait sweet for the next venture.

We got out of our car, just to feel the freshness of air and see the beauty. We walked around, clicked photos, looked at the passers by and restarted after 15-20 mins.

By now we had crossed Bangalore and its outskirts; were passing small towns of Karnataka. Though there is a distinct difference between the two, but the small places we crossed looked quite prosperous in its own way of having cemented houses, TV and internet cables, local public transport etc..

We enjoyed every bit of it. Like temple, houses and its colour, local shops ambience, women’s accessories are also uniquely different of every state of India.

We crossed small towns, villages, long stretch of paddy fields, some empty stretches where neither crops nor people were seen, between two villages.

Then we reached to the forest area. It’s a long stretch mixture

Unscheduled halt
of good and bad roads. Small habitats are also there but less crowded. It’s the area along the western ghat and the forest is a deciduous one. It was early summer time, some trees have shredded their leaves, some has got new leaves. Altogether it was a beautiful view with a wide range of green shades. The sunlight was peeping through the gaps of trees mainly without the leaves one. We could see upto the depth of the forest through the trunks of the trees. We could see the boards “Drive slowly animals may cross the road,” There could be wild animals deep inside the jungle, might roam around on to the roads but during day time it would have been a rare sight. Still we all live with hope and we kept our hopes on. We had to content ourselves with one fox crossing the road.

Lunch time was approaching and our stomach started growling. We started hunting for the restaurant. Being forest area only with small villages we were not able to locate one though locals were directing us but not satisfying us. 45 minutes passed, no food joint found. We thought of stopping now, the first
Goa
Beach, Sky - sunset and a coconut tree
one we find. In between we saw one sweet lime juice seller. We satisfied ourselves with that.

Another 30 minutes gone, nothing was found. We were sure that we have to take lunch only after reaching Goa around 3pm. We diverted ourselves from this search. All of a sudden we saw a small hotel beside a shop. We stopped and ordered for Rice, Roti , Dal and Chicken Curry. It was a smallest joint I would ever had lunch at, but unbelievable taste of the food. Home grind-ed spices by traditional method, no adulteration, no short cut during preparation. As we say "" yummy "".The taste still lies on my taste buds. Same day dinner at Taj also could beat it.

We were so happy and satisfied after the lunch that we spent some time roaming around. We were almost reaching to the Goa state. Within an hour we crossed the forest area and reached Goa.

We will love to come back to Goa by this route again and obviously stop for the lunch there.

We have spent the past three days in Mysore. We toured the palace which was built in the early 1900's, and is absolutely beautiful. It is so opulent with colorful murals on the walls and high domed ceilings with carvings and paintings. At night the whole outside is lit up with thousands of lights.Will post some pictures, but unfortunately we were not allowed to take pictures inside.

As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end, so now our time in incredible India is done. Words cannot describe the experiences we have had. India is a country of contrasts, from richness and opulence to squaller and rubble. The people are warm and friendly, willing to help and always smiling. We have seen and experienced so much in our short time here, and yet there is so much more. I just may have to come back. Anybody want to come with me?

Thanks for reading and for the comments. See you all soon.

Ready to Ride
My car fitted with the new BnB bicycle rack
I recently re-discovered a childhood craze of mine. As a kid, I would literally beg anyone I could find with a cycle to lend it to me for a few minutes. Those were not the days of speciality kids cycles (or at least we could not afford one), so a lot of us would 'half pedal' on adult cycles - yes, the big black heavy ones. Since we did not have one in our house, any guest or neighbour who had one fell victim to my persistent pleading. Well, 30 years later, I can afford a much better cycle, and don't need to plead anyone any more. I makes me wonder why I did not re-start cycling earlier.

Anyway - I got myself a Schnell Jaguar 2.0 MTB about a month ago, and after a couple of 35-40 km rides over the last few weekends, on insistence of my good friend Tatha, we ventured to ride from Bangalore to Nandi hills, about 68 km from my house. Tatha has been cycling for about a year now, and had recently come back from a 130 km trip to Coorg. On the other hand, I had been cycling for only a month
Almost there.. that's my friend Tatha
and had no hill climbing experience whatsoever. Riding the first 60 km on largely flat good roads (with light slopes at times) seemed doable, but I was definitely unsure of the 8 km climb of about a 1000 m. I had read in some blogs that it was a moderately difficult climb (I had NO idea what that really meant - moderately difficult for whom ???), especially if one is cycling from Bangalore, and not just from the foothills. We'll never know till we try - so we set off one Sunday morning.

Note: This write-up is about my cycle ride to Nandi hills strictly from a beginner's point of view. During the week before the ride, I could not find a single entry which would tell a novice like me as to how difficult or easy would it be. Hopefully, this blog could help a first-timer.

The plan was this: We would start around 5:45 AM from our houses so that we meet around 6:30 AM at Hebbal (about 17 km from my house). We'll then ride to the foothills of Nandi hills, with a break for breakfast in between. After that, we'll try climbing as much
That's me.. almost at the top
as possible. Our wives and kids would join us in cars around 11 AM at Nandi hills, and we'll hitch a ride back. Our cars were fitted with brand new cycle racks for this purpose.

As usual (for me), I got almost no sleep the night before as I was too excited about the trip, and also worried that I wouldn't wake in time. After a lot of tossing and turning, I slept only at 3 AM to catch about 2 hours of disturbed sleep before getting up. A strong cup of strong freshly brewed black coffee and a cold shower meant I was feeling absolutely fresh - though I knew that the lack of sleep would take its toll at some point. Anyway - I was off by around 6:05 AM - 20 minutes behind schedule. A note on what I packed with me: A change of clothes, a lightweight cycle pump, about 1.5 l of water (half of it with Gatorade powder) and a couple of energy bars. Of course I had my cycling shorts (the bum-pads are God-sent !!), gloves and helmet on.

The first section of the ride (17 km, to Hebbal) was a
On the top... Conquered Nandi Betta
breeze. It was nice and cool - empty roads & ideal riding conditions. I made it to Hebbal by 6:45 AM. There I met Tatha, and after around 5 minutes of hamstring and calf muscle stretches, we set off. Riding along NH7 (we did not take the elevated highway) was super-smooth - though some cars & trucks coming on the wrong side was a major irritant. We kept up a good pace of around 28-30 kmph on the flat sections. We planned to have breakfast at the McDonalds just before BIAL, but found it closed when we reached there around 7:40 AM. Damn !! Anyway - we rode on, and just before turning of NH7 towards Nandi Hills, we found a new 'parantha joint'. Being pretty hungry by that time, we devoured a couple of large stuffed paranthas along with a nice cup of steaming hot tea. Well - that was a mistake - as we soon found out. A 'kinda-obvious-on-hindsight' tip to anyone trying this for the first time: Getting enough calories is necessary for a trip like this, however, getting them from oil-soaked aloo paranthas is a BAD idea !!

It took us around 30 minutes to
yep.... !!!
finish breakfast - we got started and soon took the left turn on Nandi hills road. We had about 15 kms to go till the foothills, and the road was lovely (with gentle up and down slopes). This is when we started realizing our folly - it was REALLY difficult to cycle hard with oily food stuffed in our tummies. The 15 kilos of extra weight that I always carry on my self didn't help matters either!! Yet - we were still high on enthusiasm, and reached the foothills just before 9:30 AM - on time with our original schedule. Less than 3.5 hours for 60 km, including a couple of small breaks and 1 longish breakfast stop. Not bad, we thought. We realised at the same time that the real test lay ahead. I had already cycled the maximum I had ever done in my life in a single day.

After about 15 minutes of rest, we got started for the uphill ride. For a novice like me, and with tired legs, it was tough. Period. I somehow got through the first 1 km - thinking all the time 'how soon till I give up'. Tatha, despite a
The downhill Ride was AMAZING...
nagging knee pain, kept up the pace ahead of me, and at times stopped to let me catch up. After about 2-3 km, I started feeling a bit more confident (still hating all the aloo paranthas though). When we took a break around the 3.5 km mark, the thought was - 'we are almost halfway - ab to pahunch ke hi rahenge' !! But the toughest section was yet to come. We had to stop once more at the 4.5 km mark, and then again at around 6 km. We walked for a few hundred meters pushing our cycles along to regain our breath - the hairpin bends were tough even though we were down to our lowest gears.


We stopped for a couple of photos - sadly, our first photos of the whole ride. Then with new-found energy (maybe it was adrenalin, or gatorade, or maybe even the much accused aloo paranthas, which kept us going....) we cycled up the last couple of km. ""Phew.... !!"" - was the thought at the gates of Nandi hills.

My wife Payal reached about the same time - thrilled at having her first drive up Nandi hills with our
On the way downhill
new Duster AWD. Sadly - 2-wheelers are not allowed on top of Nandi hills, and that includes cycles !!! On second thoughts - maybe I will put a couple of training wheels next time, convert the cycle into a 4 wheeler, and whizz past the security guard !! Stupid rules !!

We parked our cycles - went up to the top in the car. We spent some time on the top though it was pretty hot by then (we reached around 11:10 AM - 5 hours after I started from home). And then was time for the best part of this journey - the CRAZY ride downhill !!😊.. WHIZZZZZZ.. is how we went. I touched a maximum speed of 56kmph, and it was unadulterated fun !!. Some photos were clicked by Aditi (Tatha's wife) this time. In less than 20 minutes, we were at the foothills again.We loaded our cycles on the cars, had a quick picnic of paranthas (home made this time) and chicken curry under the trees, and drove back home. This would be the time to say THANK YOU to Aditi, Payal and Tinai (my sister) for driving up all the way with the kids, bringing
The glee is visible on our faces :)
yummy food, and driving us back. The trip wouldn't have been half as enjoyable without you guys. Back home.. we downed a couple of chilled beers (yep.. we EARNED them). The evening went in a blur - the thrill, tired muscles, lack of sleep and the couple (ok, more than just 2) of beers making for a heady mixture 😊

Tips for the first timer cyclist to Nandi Hills:
1) Give yourself at least 5 hours (if going on an MTB / Hybrid) including breaks.
2) Start early - maybe around 4:30 / 5:00 AM. The uphill climb would be much better.
3) Do NOT eat oily paranthas / anything heavy just before the climb. Light yet high calorie food is the way to go.
4) Include as many breaks as you have to during the climb - remember, you are not racing. It is the journey that matters. Enjoy - you WILL get there.
5) Get a ride back home - cycling back 60 more kms, if you are not used to doing ~100 km rides, would be really tough.
.. and finally...
6) if you wondering whether to do it... I'd say.. JUST DO IT.. it is ABSOLUTELY worth the effort. and yes.. I am definitely going back 😊



Cheers.
BTW - this is my first ever blog. If you reach the end, do drop me a note 😊 Constructive criticism welcome !!

Karnatake state parliament, note the hoarding
Bangalore is big, busy and bustling. Actually, make that huge and hectic. We transited through Bangalore last year without seeing anything except one massive traffic jam that lasted two hours, so this time we thought we’d devote a day to seeing the limited sites it has to offer.

But first we have to get here. Google maps had suggested it would take six hours from our peaceful haven in Wayanad, but we know it will be more. The hotel staff suggest it will take 7-8 hours, so we accede to Mr Hussain’s suggestion that we should leave at 7am. We manage this despite a delay caused by the fact that the mobile phone signal is too weak to allow us to pay our bill by credit card and we have to scrabble around to see if we have enough to pay by cash instead. Mercifully, we do – just. The first part of the journey is slow but scenic, as we head out of the Kerala hills. Then we cross the dusty plains of Karnataka. This should be quicker but a 30 mile stretch of road is being rebuilt so the driving is both slow and bumpy. After five hours
Tipu Sultan's palace
we reach Mysore and the road improves. After eight hours we are on the outskirts of Bangalore. ‘Bangalore very big city, very confusing’ mutters Mr Hussain who, to be fair, must be exhausted after so much driving. It takes another hour to reach our hotel. We are all exhausted. Mr Hussain tells us we must find a guide for the next day, as he does not think he can find his way around. He has a point.

We collapse exhausted into our room, have a very early meal and fall asleep. Next morning, the hotel has not succeeded in finding us a guide. We encounter Mr H as we set out before breakfast to find an ATM to replenish our cash, and suggest to him that we hire an auto rickshaw driver to show us the way. When we reappear after breakfast, he has found us a ‘guide’ who will show us around for 500 rupees. Mr Hussain’s good humour is restored and we set off gratefully.

With a local to guide us, the traffic is not as bad as we feared. Our guide knows the one way system, and which roads are closed while the new metro
Big Nandi in his temple, bejewelled
system is built – a much needed but highly disruptive piece of civil engineering. First stop is Tipu Sultan’s summer palace. This is a much smaller, less ornate version of the one outside Mysore, much of it having been demolished, but interesting nonetheless. A Nandi bull temple follows and then we head to Bangalore Palace. The original building was started by one Reverend Garrett (who was the principal of a local school) in 1862 and bought by the Maharajah of Mysore in 1884 to be their palace in Bangalore (one palace in Mysore was clearly not enough). The Wodeyars were the hereditary rulers of the state of Mysore, within its fluctuating boundaries, from the 14th century. They were periodically deposed by the Deccan sultans, or the Vijayanagar empire, but most famously they lost Mysore to Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan in the 18th century. Those two enlightened rulers were sworn enemies of the East India Company and scored some notable victories over Our Chaps in alliance with the Frenchies. However after Tipu Sultan was defeated and killed by the British at Sriringapatam in 1799, the grateful Wodeyars were reinstated as the ruling Maharajas by the British. They were
Bangalore palace, complete with Windsor turrets
faithful allies and supporters of the British (or should we say, puppets) until Independence in 1947. The Maharajah recently died childless and a cousin who is also without any heirs is currently holding that position, but this may be the end of the Wodeyar line.

The palace is allegedly modelled on Windsor Castle. It has some turrets and you can sort of see what they mean, but it is stretching the point a bit. It’s interesting enough, but Tripadvisor reviews were right when they say it is a overpriced, but it is rather a sorry Maharaja's palace compared to many in India. We decide not to pay £7 (!!) to take a camera in, and conclude this was a good decision. The design of the palace is a weird mix of styles – Gothic, Tudor, Palladian, Spanish art deco.... you name it! The rooms are mostly devoid of furniture and the whole place could do with some maintenance and TLC, though in has been recently renovated so it must have been in a really dire state. For example, the stuffed elephant head over the entrance door is covered in pigeon droppings, and sections of the ceiling seem to be cracking open. The audio tour tells us the Maharajah was a great art collector, but most of his collection seems to comprise execrable knock-offs of classic art and paintings of big boobied and naked white women, or just lousy paintings. Not the best collection ever.....the whole place looks like it is going to fall apart and short of money.



We seem now to have ‘done’ the main sites of Bangalore. Back at the hotel, Sara has the inspired idea of popping to the McDonalds next door for lunch. We virtually never eat McDonalds at home, but sometimes when travelling it fills a craving you didn’t even realise you had. There was a lot of controversy when they first opened in India, as beef is almost universally not acceptable, so the only options are chicken or veggie. The chicken burger and chips are wonderful.

Alright...



Dear family, friends, and others who may be reading this...



I'm still alive! Hooray!



Not that it's really a surprise, but I hope you'll all be pleased to know this. Anyway, let me start with a quick overview of what's going on here:

Basically, in search of a form of 'right livelihood', I started studying Regional Development & Innovation (RDI) back in 2012. There I heard about and got interested in permaculture, which lead to my doing a 10-week internship at Quail Springs in California in 2013, as part of my RDI studies. At Quail Springs I met Malvikaa Solanti and Levi Mataga, who have been working on a permaculture project called SwaYYam in South India. After almost a year and a half of 'regular' studying in Wageningen, I contacted Malvikaa to ask if I could do my 20-week internship at Swayyam. As you probably guessed, she said yes, since I'm typing this in the house she's renting near her land in India...

So far I've been here about 4 days. When I say here, I mean India. I stayed at Malvikaa's daughter's place for 2 days and then we drove south through Mysore and Gundlupet to the Bandipur National Forest & Wildlife Reserve, which also includes several small villages. The closest to where I'm at is called Yelachatti, for those of you who wish to google earth it 😉 It's seriously tiny and reminds me of the villages in Hungary my class went to in 2013, with about 20-30 houses per village.

Here's where I wanted to post some impressions of Bangalore, but unfortunately that's not possible right now due to an unstable internet connection, so this thing is going to be picture-less for the time being. Oh well... time to use your imagination (or google images)!

We only really walked around once to buy some things we needed, so there's an immense part of the city completely unknown to me. Basically it's a concrete jungle, complete with palm trees and other exotic foliage! Although the airport was super-neat, the streets are quite littered with trash and during the day there are people everywhere. Also quite a few stray dogs. The traffic is pretty crazy, but I found it easy to get used to. Just be aware of your surroundings (which y'all should be wherever you are anyway). It surprised me more that they drove on the left, although knowing India's history of British occupation, it shouldn't have surprised me at all I guess.

People everywhere are quite friendly, as long as you smile and are friendly to them. I've gotten some stares, though mostly due to my lip piercing. Malvikaa explained that it's common for men to get earrings (somehow it's good for their health) and for women it's mandatory. Women also get their noses pierced and this usually symbolizes that they're engaged or married. So piercings aren't strange, just the placement, which I guess is the same in most places.

Anyway, I get along great with Malvikaa. And then there's the tiny girl Gheeta who compensates her lack in stature by having the largest smile I've ever seen! Supersweet girl and she's very lucky to get a lot of appropriate support from Malvikaa. Both are also incredible cooks! I have been eating really well (and vegetarian) here and I plan to come back with some great recipes and the knowledge of what to do with them!

So, yesterday morning we left the house at about 5.50 AM and drove and drove to Bandipur. After we arrived we had lunch and then went to the land. There I met 6 people from Auroville (all but one are Europeans) who have been working for a week on building a wooden house on granite beams that have been dug into the ground. It's quite amazing and will look beautiful I'm sure. Today I got to know them a bit better but also 'met' some Indian guys and helped them in the process of getting a 5000 liter water tank up on a stone construction. I took pictures of all of it.

What else can I write... hmm, I feel very comfortable here and have been considering the reasons. Of course the weather is one (although I'm already sunburnt) though I think it might also feel a bit like 'home', since so many things remind me of life in Gabon. The friendliness of the people is also very welcoming. Seriously... Europeans have a lot to learn when it comes to just being nice.

Okay, that's it for now... oh, fyi, I have no idea how to write a blog, so please gimme tips if you want to hear more about this or that.

Kthxbai!

Early morning n Nagarhole
Fortunes change fast on safari, and today is as frustrating as yesterday was wonderful. We have been sharing a jeep with a lone Danish traveller called Jakob and a family of three Indians who are regular visitors to the lodge. The son is in his late twenties, touting a pro model Nikon D4, a second Nikon, and a range of massive lenses. It has already become clear that all he wants to see is big cats, pretty much to the exclusion of anything else. We want to see them too, but we also want to be able to stop and watch other animals when we get the chance of a good shot. This morning, he overrules the ranger’s advice on where to go. We see almost no game of any sort and our patience breaks when we spend about ten minutes with him trying to photograph an eagle that is so far away the rest of us cannot see it. We are even less pleased when we get back and find that everyone else saw a tiger.

At lunch time, we and Jakob, our Danish friend, ask to go out with somebody different in the afternoon. The request does not
Riki Tiki Tavi aka mongoose
seem to surprise anyone and we’re allocated to a different jeep. Our guide from the morning comes over and apologises – he was clearly as frustrated as us. In the afternoon we are with a quiet couple who are much better company. We still don’t see any tigers or leopards, although we hear warning calls and pass the largely dismembered corpse of a deer killed two to three days previously. We smell it long before we see it – a horrible rotting stench that takes us by surprise as try to work out where it could be coming from. Only the birds are left eating it now, and we see two different sorts of vulture perched in the trees above, and crows attacking the remains of the head down on the ground.

We are enchanted by a family of langurs. The little ones play boisterously together, and the smallest baby – maybe two weeks old, and black all over, unlike his pale grey parents, practices walking along a branch. He moves a metre away from his mother and then back again, repeatedly. Sometimes he falls off but scrambles back up, and then has a quick cuddle before setting off
Little langurs at play
again.

Next morning we haul ourselves out of bed for our last game drive. We and Jacob join two others in our jeep and hope that once again there will be just five of us. But at the last minute, another ‘look how big my lens is’ fellow arrives sporting a 600mm lenses, with his son of about 7. A heated conversation ensues with the ranger who then turns to us and asks if we would mind moving to the back of the jeep as the new guy ‘wants both our seats to take photographs’. ‘Er, so do we, and why should we move?’ More heated debate. “blah blah foreigners blah blah” we hear in the Kannada language. 'Are we sure you won't move?' 'Up yours mate’. We begin to think we will never leave but eventually, with much ill grace, he sits in the back (where the view is no worse). Our hopes are raised early on in the drive, when the range spots fresh leopard scat (or shit, as the non naturalist would say). After five minutes, the ranger excitedly shouts ‘leopard’. We crane forward excitedly. ‘Where, where?’ He points to a distant spot in the grass.
Early steps
We make out an indistinct shape moving through the grass and have to take his word that it was a leopard. We don’t even have time to take any photos. Our hopes remain high for a better viewing, but they come to naught.

We return to the lodge where the occupants of one very full jeep, whom we had pitied for being stuck three abreast, were excitedly telling everyone they had seen three tigers, three leopards and three jackals. Surely they must be having us on? But no, they really did see a tiger with cubs, a leopard with cubs and three jackals. We feel cheated and self-pitying. As we muse on this, we reflect that going on safari requires the three Ps – patience, persistence and phlegmatism. By far the hardest of these is phlegmatism – the ability to accept seeing nothing graciously and without resentment. Even when other people have had truly stunning luck and you have not!! David likens it to being an Everton supporter. You keep paying your money to attend and turning up in the hope that one day you will win, but it rarely happens.



After a quick breakfast, we
Look I can stand upright
leave the lodge and set off for the hills in Wayanad, Kerala. As we leave the game park, Mr Hussain points out an elephant – the best sighting of the morning. And then, just as we get back into the car, he shouts ‘snake’ and we see a huge snake slithering with surprising speed across the road. Once out of the forest, we enter a verdant landscape of bright green trees, bushes and paddy fields, in sharp contrast to the dusty brown/grey of the last three days. The towns here are markedly more prosperous than in Karnataka which one must ascribe to the richness of the agriculture as this is not the Kerala of beaches where most tourists we head (we are not tourists, of course, but independent travellers). The roads are properly made up, with a central white line, and the towns often have unbroken pavements. There are many brightly coloured, substantial villas with fine wooden doors and windows that would not look out of place on the Mediterranean. Our next three nights are at a place described as a boutique hotel, in the hills in the heart of a tea plantation. It is hard to describe where it
Boar
is but we eventually find our way there. We wind through ever narrower and worse quality roads as we pass one tea estate after another. Our hotel is perched on a hillside overlooking rolling slopes of tea in all directions, with a view to mist covered peaks beyond. The hotel is newly built and we have a spacious room with floor to ceiling glass on two walls, giving a wonderful view. It is a beautiful and peaceful place to enjoy some downtime.

First wild elephant
I love morning game drives. Out at dawn, in time to watch the sun come up over the forest. It’s cool but not cold, in the breeze created as you drive in an open jeep. The air is fresh, and smells slightly of smoke, either woodsmoke from the villagers' fires, or from the controlled but now dead fires set along the paths in the forest to improve the chance of seeing animals. So the first ten to twenty feet from the road is dark grey, with a scattering of ash and some lines of white where logs have slowly smouldered out of existence. Beyond that there is sometimes forest and sometimes scrub. The forest consists of mostly spindly trees, well spaced out, with skinny silver trunks, interspersed with some bigger trees with dark bark that looks like it will drop off in clumps. The scrub is grass and thorny bushes, which look impenetrable from a distance but are in fact threaded with numerous narrow pathways created by animals. It’s the dry season, and everything is brown or a dusty green. The teak trees have shed most of their huge leaves, which cover the forest floor, and only the tops of the
Tiger
bushes have any green left on them.

The first section of this morning’s drive is along the main road that runs through the park. It’s a new experience to share a game drive with lads on motorbikes and the A1 Banana van. Within five minutes we see an elephant right by the roadside, the first wild one we’ve seen in India. After looking both ways (it clearly knows the green cross code) it lumbers across the road and off into the forest. Five minutes later, we hear some alarm calls and stop. Shortly after stopping the ranger shrieks ‘tiger’ and we reverse up to the road in time to watch a large male tiger walk very slowly across the road before vanishing into the undergrowth on the other side. Four cameras click on motordrive. The fastest by far belongs to the Indian guy sitting up front with a pro Nikon and one of the biggest lenses ever seen (complete with camouflage markings in his lens to match the camouflage fatigues he is wearing – what a prat), who is on autoshoot and will have an even bigger job editing his photos than we face. The tiger is majestic, and
Tiger heading into undergrowth
wholly uninterested in us, as tigers always are (unless they are maneaters!).

We turn off onto the red dust roads that criss cross the small section of the park open to tourists, and loop round in the hope of spotting the tiger again. But despite a lot of sitting and waiting patiently, he does not appear again. There’s a lot of sitting waiting involved in game drives and it’s always hard to know how long to wait and when to move on. But that is not our choice, by and large – the ranger decides. If you close your eyes as you sit, you can feel the peace of the surroundings, and start to make out a whole range of different bird calls.

We don’t see so much on the rest of the drive – spotted deer (chital - just like you get in Richmond Park), some sambur, a family of wild boar and a variety of birds. But the pleasure of the drive is partly in the anticipation, and partly in the small things – a myriad tiny cobwebs, white with the dew, on the ground stretched over tiny holes (do the spiders live under ground?), a

solitary langur monkey sitting at the base of a tree and looking contemplative, the strange site of a termite mound that has been built all the way round a small tree, looking for all the world like a geometric sandcastle that has solidified.

We return to the lodge for breakfast and start the mega-task of downloading and editing the photos before heading out again at 3.45. This time we are on a boat, on the lake formed when the Kabini River was dammed. The lake is now a key part of the park, providing fresh grass which grows in the cracked mud surface left behind when the lake recedes in the dry. In late March (ie just a couple of weeks after we are here) hundreds of elephants will congregate at the lake’s edge to drink and feed on the shrinking grassland available. We don’t see hundreds, but we do have a great view of a group of four elephants who drink from the water’s edge, then slowly walk into the water, spraying themselves all over and wade or swim to the other side before climbing out. There is something very special about elephants, and we could watch them
Eagle
all day. But mostly, the boat trip is about seeing birds. We spot an osprey sitting on a dead tree stump eating a freshly caught fish, and an eagle flying past clutching a small bird in its talons. We manage to get photos of a brilliant blue Indian kingfisher, a beautiful small bird that is elusive and hard to capture on film. And we enjoy the breeze and the peace of the water.



In the evening, we enjoy our first gin and tonic of the holiday. We’re upset to hear we missed a leopard sighting, but that’s the luck of the draw!

Tiger reserve trail
We set off from Coonoor at 7am, bidding farewell to the oasis that is the Taj hotel. Needless to say, as this is the day we are leaving there is not a cloud or patch of mist to be seen and we enjoy distant views across the Nilgiris. We have to stop after about an hour at a charming spot next to a stinking bus station for the driver to buy yet another permit. While he does so we eat our packed breakfast box given to us by the hotel. Finishing this up David, being British, espies a bin and sets off to put the box into the bin. He finds he has to step his way carefully in his open toed sandals to avoid the cow, dog and human turds along the roadside. Getting to the bin he finds it is overflowing, with two dogs with their heads in excavating the contents and there is no space for the box, so he offers the remains of our breakfast to the dogs. Might as well just have thrown the box out of the car window as the roadside is already covered with litter.....

We sit for a few more minutes
Mother and baby langur, 2 weeks old or so
enjoying the stink of diesel fumes from the belching buses, and survey the groups of huddled people waiting on the corners for the gangmasters to arrive looking for day rate workers. Eventually we set off through the beautiful rolling Tamil Nadu national forest (or something like that). The scent of pine and citronella wafts periodically through the window as we wind down to the valley.

Sara is having some bowel problems. This is every Westerner's dread on an Indian road journey. She manages to render three roadside toilets (one in a petrol station and two in a hotel, which was really antisocial) unusable, but what is a girl to do? There is no running water so you just have to do what you have to do and run away. The fourth toilet defeats her though as many previous users' shit is already piled up to the level of the seat, so after the sight and smell of that her body appears to tell her that she can hold on for now. Nothing other than a bluebottle would want to enter that stall.

The temperature is rising and the journey passes hour after hour. We pass through dusty little
Baby clings to mama
towns. In one town we have to stop to buy the Karnataka permit. A legless beggar sees us waiting in the car and drags himself over on his knuckles to scratch pathetically at the car door, while a wretched looking crone with a baby bangs on Sara's window. We resist the temptation to give out cash. Working Indians greatly disapprove of beggars and get really cross if you give them money. Mr Hussain returns to the car and shoos the crone away. I hope he saw the legless creature and didn’t run over him....I hope the squeal was just our tyres burning on the tarmac and not the cries of a squashed beggar.

Eventually we find the turning off the road to Mysore that we need to find. However now the journey gets a bit tricky as all road signs are now in Kannada not Tamil or Malayalam, and Mr Hussain neither reads nor speaks Kannada, so stopping to check our direction of travel becomes a bit trickier. Eventually we find ourselves driving through Mudumalai Tiger Reserve followed by Bandipur Tiger Reserve (this on the main highway to Mysore!). We scan the forest but see only a couple of
Woodpecker busy demolishing tree
elephants in the distance. At one point a couple of thuggish types flag us down and ask if we would like to take a jeep safari into Bandipur. It seems unlikely they are kosher as they are not in uniform and it is midday when no one goes offroad in the park, and we decline their kind offer.

After six hours we roll into our lodge in Kabini, which was formerly the Maharajah of Mysore's private hunting lodge. It sounds very grand but unfortunately these days it is run as government of Karnataka enterprise. The result is that it is overpriced, the food is bland and unvarying, and the service is what you would expect of a state enterprise. But it is the place you need to stay to be sure of getting on safari. The number of visitors per day is limited so you don’t want to find you are staying in a nice lodge but cannot get into the park! We have a nice cottage fronting the lake; this place could be so much better with private management. Such a shame.



We have arrived though in time for our first game drive that afternoon.
Malabar tree squirrel
So some lunch, a short rest and then we are kitted up and ready to go out in the jeep. We see a tiger, but it is a long way off in a clearing and our view is somewhat obscured by a tree. Still, it feels like a good omen.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Hampi
February 22nd 2015
Published: February 22nd 2015


Way to Hemakunt Hill
One of the UNESCO world heritage sites, HAMPI is a small village in the northern part ofKarnatakaStateinIndia.



We left for Hampi from Chitradurga afternoon on the last week of December. It took three hours to reach the place.



Hampi is situated on the banks of theTungabhadraRiver. Like Mahabalipuram in Tamilnadu this place also represents the sculptural arts of earlier centuries of the southern parts of the country.



The site remains as the ruins of Vijayanagara Empire. It was part of the capital of this empire in the 14th century.



The major attractions here inter alia include the centuries oldVirupakshaTemple,AchutharayaTemple,HazaraRamaTemple,KrishnaTemple,VittalaTemple, the sacred Tank nearKrishnaTemple, Ganesha Mandapa,UndergroundSivaTemple,AnjaneyaTemple, Elephant Stables, Lotus Mahal, Monolithic Nandi Bull, Tall carved pillars, canals, Aqueducts, Two storied gateway & Tungabhadra river.



In the evening we covered theSivaTemplearea, Royal Enclosure, Fortified walls,WatchTower, the stepped Tank near the underground temple, Elephant stables, etc.



As the trip was shortly planned we were unable to book accommodation in the few hotels available at Hampi or near by town Hospet. Hence we had to cross Tungabhadra to reach Gangavathi, another township around 40 kms from Hampi,
Ruined Fort
where we could book Hotel Sarvesh thru makemytrip. In the night we reached there, had dinner and next day morning returned to Hampi. On the way between the two towns, we could see on both sides of the road various vegetable cultivations, farms, and beautiful meadows.



Next day we moved around the Bazaar area, Hemakunta Hill, Ganesha Mandapa, Kodanda rama &VittalaTemples, Two storied gateway,VirupakshaTemple, etc. Due to shortage of time we had to give up the plan to visit theBearParkin the near by area and by evening we left forBangalore.



The following are some tips which may be useful for a prospective traveler who would like to explore this heritage site:



1.It may take two-three days to cover all the monuments and places in detail as the ruins are vast and spread over large area. Hence either you may plan accordingly or prefer selected items/views after studying the location map.2.Try to fetch accommodation in Hampi itself well advance, which will save a lot of time.3.Carry with you adequate drinking water as no shops are available in most of the parts.4.Eateries are there in the Bazaar area, Mango Tree Restaurant is one
Sunset - Hampi
among them. However avoid peak ours for lunch as these small restaurants would be crowded too much and you have to wait outside for long time.5.For those who plan to connect withBangalore, plan carefully as it would take seven hours journey. En route you can visit Chitradurga fort, another heritage site.

Virupaksha Temple
Hampi, the ancient capital of the Vijayanagara empire is in ruins in North Karnataka. My cousin, her daughter and I decided it is a must see and jumped into the train headed north from Bangalore.

I had booked air-conditioned railway seats but whole night I was wondering if I did indeed because it never worked. I observed my cousin wrapped up in blanket. It was all in anticipation of coming cool air 😊

We arrived at Hampi in early hours. A co passenger kindly offered us a lift to the main town centre. We booked into a budget hotel, freshened up and ventured to see the ruins. It was very hot. We drank water like fish but it was not enough. Apparently all government approved guides were taken. We looked around into the carvings, temples and other ruins like aliens not making a head or tail. Finally, we took an auto rickshaw driver as guide and he took us around and explained the main monuments of attraction.

The city was once magnificent and prosperous ruled by the Deva Raya kings. It had glorious rock cut Hindu and Jain temples, royal baths, elephant stable, market places and gorgeous gates
Hampi ruins
among others. The Vitthal temple with musical pillars made of rock is simply unique. The carvings in the temple were exquisite showing daily life of the people, trading of horses with white Europeans, mythological animals and stories from Ramayana and Mahabharat. This place is apparently the birthplace of monkey god, Hanuman and was formally called Kishkinda. The market place with miles forgotten shops which sold gold-silver jewellery in return of horses must have been splendid. Vijayanagar empire was rich and envy of its neighbouring kingdoms who finally destroyed it.

It was Basanti Panchami or day of Saraswati (goddess of learning) pooja (worship). As per Bengali custom, from this day onwards we start eating crunchy jujube berries! Indeed, we bought some and munched our way to Tungabhadra dam. The vast expanse of water in the reservoir appealed like an ocean for a quick swim. The catchment area had been built into agricultural fields and recreation area for children. An ideal picnic spot.

Since our return train tickets did not get confirmed, we bought local bus tickets which hopped and jumped very badly. I guess, it ensured that bus drivers do not sleep at the expense of poor passengers!
Pillars at Temple

These historical places had attained unimaginable heights in different points of history that we were left awestruck. Even the elephants stables were magnificent. If elephants had such a great life, I am sure humans had an awesome time too.

RAJSAMAND-ONE DAY OUTING NEAR UDAIPUR

PICTURES BY MANJU LATA GOSWAMI

The culture and history of Rajasthan attracts large number of tourists to this part of country. There is general impression in minds of visitors is that former royals lived lavishly,were always fighting and committing atrocities on their people. The truth is exactly reverse, rulers were always concerned about welfare of their people and many monuments are living testimony of their worry for people.They developed many facilities like roads, large water reserviors, shelter places, temples etc. Rajsamand or Rajsamand lake is one such example. It is located 66 kms.north of Udaipur near town of same name which also a district headquarter. Rajsamand was constructed by Maharan Raj Singh in 1660 by putting a masonary dam across river Gomti,he was a descendant of Maharana Pratap and ruled between 1652 to 1680, he was contemporary of Aurangzeb. Rajsamand lake has been source of drinking water,irrigation and of course picnic spot for both locals and tourists.

There is a very interesting anecdote about dvevelopment of this lake. Maharana Raj Singh had gone to Kishangarh near Jaipur to marry the princess, on return
IMG-20150307-WA0008
Another voew
journey rains started and marriage party was stuck up due to flood in Gomati river flowing near Rajasamand. After rains stopped,Maharana returned to his capital at Udaipur.After few days he called meeting of his advisers and ministers and said"" I was not aware that so much water is available in our jurisdiction, can we develop any method to use this water for our people. One of his minister proposed a dam on this river, this was immediately accepted by the ruler and asked to prepare a budget estimate. So work immediately started, it took 4 years to construct this dam. Historical records tell us that when formal inauguration took place,many Rajas and their representatives attended the ceremony at that time. As on today Rajasmand lake is important source of drinking water and irrigation for residents of this district.



General view



Rajasamand is a masonary dam covered with off white to cream coloured slabs and pieces of marble.The water body has following dimensions- 6.40 kms. long, 2.82 kms.wide,18mts. deep. Dam is at the southern end of the lake, having more than 1.ookm.length. The entire length of dam has 9 ghats associated with 9 elevated pavillions

or platforms collectively known as ""NAUCHOWKIS"". These platforms are covered with square shaped canopies. Each platform is decorated with fine beautiful carvings on both inside and outer parts. Carvings include sun, Hindu gods, birds,floral motifs, geometrical figures. other than platforms 4 arch gates are also erected on the main masonry dam. Apart from this history of Mewar or Udaipur region is also carved out in form of 1017 stanzas known as RAJPRASHASTI. Because of its vast size this lake was also used by British as landing place for sea planes in World War II. As on today this reservoir is important source of drinking water and irrigation for residents of this district.

connectivity with Delhi -Mumbai. One can stay in Udaipur and then hire transport from there. Rajsamand town is on 4 lane national highway so it is less than an hour's drive from Udaipur. Being on NH, there is 24 hour transport availability in form of state roadways buses/private travel buses taxis etc. One can also go there by train from Udaipur but takes 2-3 hours, and lake side is 5 kms. from railway station,while it is only 1.5 kms. from highway. Many hotels are available on way to lake side where one can stay. Many restaurants provide snacks, tea and breakfast, one can also have lunch, or tourists can also come with pack lunch from Udaipur if you are staying there. This area has moderate climate so one can go there at any time of year except May-June.

January 14th 2015

keshava temple
HE SAID...
We left Mudumalai National Park at 10.30am and continued our northward journey, this time heading for Mysore. India is often termed the “land of the farmer”, and we could easily see why as we drove through vast expanses of agricultural land of cotton, palm trees, bananas, sugar cane and rice. Every so often we’d drive through a tiny village, but most of the time the rural landscape stretched to the horizon.

Slow agricultural machinery, trucks and farm animals were sharing very narrow roads with speeding buses, motorbikes and cars – which equated to very dangerous driving conditions. We came across an accident between a bus and a car, but it didn’t appear that anyone was injured.

We dropped into the Chamundi Hill Temple on our way into Mysore. We wandered through the popular and crowded temple, and on the way out I made a donation to the temple and picked up an orange rope bracelet and a red/orange cotton bracelet (which I wore for the rest of our India travels). We jumped back in the minibus and headed towards Mysore, eventually arriving at 2.30pm.

We checked into Hotel KVC International and ordered dahl tadka (cooked lentils
chamundi hill
topped with tempered spices) and vegetable shahajahani (vegetable curry) for lunch in Spicy Dine, the hotel’s restaurant. The menu description for vegetable shahajahani was ‘vegetables cooked in semi Indian gravy’. I wasn’t entirely sure what semi Indian gravy was, but it tasted great.

We had a masala chai (spiced sweet milky tea) to freshen up before heading out to Mysore Palace at 4.30pm. We wandered around the impressive but crumbling palace for about an hour, and I was amazed at the skill of the painters who’d managed to paint a cow in one of the frescos whose eyes and face literally followed you as you walked past it. I walked back and forwards past this cow at least three times, and the illusion was extraordinary. Unfortunately we were being led through the palace by a local guide with a bit too much attitude and an enormous chip on his shoulder, and it tainted my experience somewhat. On our way back to the hotel we briefly stopped in at St Philomena’s Church and the Eco-Friendly Incense Sticks Factory.

We had a few drinks in the hotel’s roof top bar before heading out to dinner at the Park Lane Hotel
chamundi hill
Restaurant at 7.30pm. We shared an aloo gobi (potato and cauliflower curry) with butter naans (leavened bread cooked in a wood fired oven) and parathas (naans stuffed with potato), and it was excellent. The combination of potato and cauliflower in a hot curry sauce is just so good. Four of us crammed into an auto rickshaw (motorised tricycle with a passenger cabin) on the way back to the hotel, where we kicked back in the rooftop bar before heading down to the hotel lobby at midnight to access the free wifi. It had been a long travel day, and we were exhausted.

We headed out for a morning walk at 8.30am and unknowingly found ourselves in the midst of Pongal celebrations, a four day festival where families get together to honour the year’s harvest. We realised the day was a little different to most when we met a yellow cow in the street. Cows are honoured for their contribution to the harvest, and this involves colouring the cows yellow. We also passed a number of women creating rangoli (colourful chalk drawings) on the streets outside their houses. We withdrew some rupees from a guarded ATM, stopped at a tiny
chamundi hill
cafe (Preethi Sagar) for a chai (tea) and met a few more yellow cows on our way back to the hotel.

We jumped into a minibus at 9.30am and headed to the Keshava Temple in Somanathapur, an hour’s drive from Mysore. We wandered around the temple in the intense morning sun, got a little distracted by a full-on wedding photo shoot, cooled down with a fresh coconut juice and then headed back to Mysore at midday.

On the drive back to Mysore, the tranquillity of rural India slowly gave way to the mayhem of urban India, and this transition continued to amaze me. We headed straight to the Red Pepper Restaurant, cooled down with a fresh lime soda (fresh lime juice, sugar syrup, salt and soda water) and ordered a ‘veg thali’ – with rice, paratha (naan stuffed with potato), vegetable soup, rasam (spicy tamarind broth), gobi manchurian (spicy cauliflower stir-fry), paneer butter masala (Indian cottage cheese curry), dahl curry (lentil curry), beetroot poriyal (beetroot fried with coconut and spices), pickle, curd, and a pappadam.

We finished lunch at 2pm and made our way to Mysore’s fascinating Devaraja Market. We wandered around the market stalls which were
chamundi hill
crammed with vivid flowers, fruits and vegetables before walking back through the city streets to our hotel. We were leaving Mysore at 8.30pm on an 11 hour overnight train to the eastern coast of India, so we settled in the hotel lobby with the free wifi and caught up on our travel notes.

We jumped into a minibus at 6pm and headed out to dinner in the house of a local Mysorean family. They’d prepared vegetable biryani (a spiced rice dish cooked with vegetables), brinjal curry (eggplant/aubergine curry), mixed vegetable curry, chicken tandoori (roast chicken marinated with a special spice paste and yoghurt), and cucumber raita (yoghurt based sauce); followed by custard and gulab jamun (fried doughnut-like milk-based balls, soaked in spiced sugar syrup). It was fantastic, and a fascinating insight into local customs. After thanking our hosts, we clambered into the minibus and headed to the train station.

Fortuitously, Mysore Palace was on the way, and its many thousands of light bulbs had been switched on for the Pongal Festival. The Palace was glowing, so we jumped out and joined the throngs of locals who were enjoying the spectacle. I felt like a moth being unwittingly drawn
mysore palace
to a bright light – it was an incredible experience.

We arrived at the train station at 8pm, picked up some snacks and boarded our overnight sleeper carriage for the 11 hour trip to Chennai. I was amazed that we were the only non-locals on the train. Families had settled in with home-cooked meals and children were excited about the journey ahead. It was a warm and friendly atmosphere.

The train left at 8.30pm on the dot. We sat and talked with two young students who were sharing our berth before settling into our bunks at around 10.30pm. The gentle rocking of the train had me asleep in no time.



SHE SAID...
It was a wrench to leave the peaceful Jungle Retreat in Mudumalai National Park for the four hour minibus ride to Mysore. The jungle landscape soon gave way to Karnataka’s plains and open farmland. We passed fields of banana trees, cotton trees and coconut trees.

The drive was mostly uneventful and I slept for about 90% of it. We were dreadfully behind on writing our blog notes and I had hoped to catch up on the bus trip, but a few late
st philomena’s church
nights in a row were starting to catch up with us. We stopped at the chain Cafe Coffee Day for hot drinks, but it was the clean toilet that was the main reason for the stop.

Mysore is the second largest city in Karnataka and used to be the royal capital (Bangalore is the State capital now). This was to be our only stop in this State. The main languages spoken in Mysore are Kannada and Hindi.

As we approached Mysore, our minibus wound its way up Chamundi Hill on the edge of town. There were convoys of buses carrying pilgrims up the same hill, and it was a little disconcerting that the buses were full beyond capacity and being driven by complete maniacs.

At the top of the hill we explored Sri Chamundeswari Temple, dedicated to the Goddess Durga. Leaving our shoes in the open air ‘cloak room’ across the street, we had just enough time to enter the temple before it closed. As we squeezed past the gate I realised the ground we were walking on was full of things I wouldn’t like to step in barefoot, but I had to put that out of
rangoli designs
my mind and keep walking.

It was the first day of the Pongal Harvest Festival and we got a little lost in the hustling, bustling crowd streaming in with their offerings. Crowds like this at first appear overwhelming in India (especially as they are so loud), but the people were very friendly and just parted to let us through. Inside the temple we made a swift circuit, and I did my best to dodge the priests dishing out blessings for a small ‘donation’. However, Karni organised blessings for all of us which were given with a tilak (red powder marking) on our foreheads.

Outside as we mixed in with the woman, men and children, I was very aware that it was so crowded that I couldn’t see the ground – and when there are cows, dogs and goats around, it pays to always see where you are putting your feet. Andrew and Lee stopped to buy bracelets for us - I picked a black one with red beads, while Andrew picked an orange one for himself.

From the hilltop, the view of Mysore was quite beautiful and far greener than I’d imagined an Indian city to look
tumeric coloured cow
like. We descended the hill a little way to a nearby statue of a large black monolithic bull (Nandi). The Goddess Durga is an incarnation of Parvati, wife of Shiva, and apparently wherever there’s a connection to Shiva, there’s a bull.

The southern Indian states celebrate the Hindu festival Pongal – a four day harvest thanksgiving celebration in mid-January – to honour the weather gods, the land’s abundance and their cattle. Pongal seems to be associated with many legends, but I like the legend which involves Lord Shiva and his bull Nandi the most. In the legend, on the third day of Pongal, Lord Shiva sent Nandi to tell the people to have an oil bath daily and eat once a month. However, Nandi got confused (as a bull probably would) and told people to eat daily and bathe once a month. This angered Shiva, so he banished Nandi to earth to help the people to toil the ground and produce more food.

On the first day of Pongal (which was our first day in Mysore), people usually buy new goods and clothes to celebrate the start of a new cycle. The second day is when the sun
keshava temple
god Lord Surya is offered special prayers. People wear their new clothes and decorate their houses with rangoli (floor designs using rice flour and coloured clay - they are called kolam in Tamil Nadu). On the third day the cattle are honoured for their part in farming life – they are washed, rubbed down with a turmeric paste, have their horns painted and are sometimes decorated with flowers. The fourth day is reserved for gathering and celebrating with families and friends.

The main food of the festival is sakkarai pongal – a dish of the season’s first rice, fresh milk, jaggery (a solid product produced from reducing sugar cane juice or palm sap), coconut, raisins, cashews and cardamom, all of which are boiled to almost a paste. When the milk and rice are boiled in a claypot, if the pot boils evenly on all sides, it’s a sign of prosperity and abundance for the year to come. Given that rice is grown throughout southern India, it’s not surprising that there are so many rice dishes – especially festive rice dishes.

We arrived in Mysore and checked into our hotel – KVC International Hotel. The street was very green
keshava temple
and calm, the hotel had huge clean rooms with hot water that worked, but annoyingly, the wifi only worked in the lobby. The biggest let down at this hotel was that the hotel staff were inefficient, slow and uninterested.

We decided to have a quick lunch in the hotel restaurant, but it was anything but quick. We ordered dahl tadka (cooked lentils topped with tempered spices) and vegetable shahajahani (vegetable curry) and rice. A guy with a really bad toupee took ten minutes to take our order, with much repeating, clarifying and more repeating. I was beginning to think we were in a sketch comedy. The food was surprisingly good, but then the bill saga began. It took Andrew 20 minutes to get (and pay) the bill. We later realised that money could only be handled in one area of the hotel, so when the staff ask for the bill, the bill was first generated by a cashier, then walked up or down to the floor we were on, then walked back to the cashier, then walked back to us with our change. How could a business as large as this hotel operate so inefficiently??

After the frustratingly
keshava temple
disorganised hour that it took us to have lunch and put some laundry in, we headed to the Mysore Palace. Mysore Palace is a product of the Wodeyar Dynasty heritage and is set in huge grounds of courtyards and gardens planted with palm trees. We had to surrender our cameras and leave our shoes in a locker before we gained entry. We were accompanied by a local guide who immediately annoyed most of us with his smartarse sayings and forced, tragic, dad-type jokes. He had clearly memorised his spiel and was put off if anyone interrupted to ask questions.

The palace is supposed to be one of the most ornate palaces in India – its interior was an in-your-face kaleidoscope of coloured glass and mirrors. It was built by the Maharaja of Mysore at the end of the 19th Century and it is a mixture of many styles of architecture and decor. The palace contained a heart wrenching amount of ivory, and more than expected amounts of blingy silver and gold. The most over-the-top items for me were the bejewelled throne and the heavy gold howdah (a seat placed on the back of an elephant with a railing and
keshava temple
canopy)... because apparently the well fed Maharaja wasn’t already heavy enough on the poor elephant’s back. There was a sense that this palace was furnished on the basis that ‘more is better’. If anyone needs a good example of man's inhumanity to taste – we found it! 😊

Even though most aspects of the decor weren’t to my taste, there were some features that were quite stunning. I loved the floor tiles and extensive stained glass in peacock motifs in the Marriage Pavilion. The soaring ornate ceilings and sculpted pillars in the Durbar Hall were eye catching, but I did question the colour choices! And the intricately carved wooden doors throughout the palace were beautiful.

My favourite part of the palace involved the paintings that had been painted with a 3D effect, where the eyes of some of the humans and the heads of the animals followed you from one side of the room to the other – our guide liked calling them ‘the Indian Mona Lisas’. It was impressive enough that a few of us kept walking backwards and forwards to test the theory.

After our un-engaging tour, we walked to the large forecourt / parade
keshava temple
ground area for a front-on look at the palace. We arrived at the same time as a large posse of small school girls in matching uniforms, and their teacher decided to send them over to practise their English. So in a very cute chorus, we got roared at... ‘hello!whereyoufromwhatsyourname?’. I disentangled myself out of the scrum of little people, but Kim and a few others were more accommodating of their high pitched squeals.

Mysore was the first place in India to get extensive electricity in the late 1920s, as the then Maharaja had built a hydroelectric power station. To this day, on some special festivals the whole palace is lit up in lights and everyone is welcome to come into the grounds to see it. We were lucky to see this on our last night, as it was lit up for Pongal. It was quite stunning to see all the buildings outlined in thousands of lights. It was packed and we were warned to keep together. I love seeing local people enjoying their own city, especially when tourist attractions in India are beyond the means of most locals (even though they pay much lower entrance fees than foreigners).
keshava temple

On our way back to the hotel we dropped into St Philomena’s Church. I quite liked this church, but there were quite a few people praying and I didn’t wish to intrude, so I didn’t look around as much as I wanted to. As with most churches we've seen in India so far, it was very apparent that it could have done with some general repairs - and it was good to see that there was a fundraising board outside for this cause.

Mysore is known for its incense, so we expressed an interest in visiting an incense factory. To say it left a bad taste in our mouths was an understatement... we walked into a small, cramped space off a little laneway and there were two people sitting on the floor rolling incense sticks at an alarmingly fast rate. One was an older woman of about 70, and the other a girl of about 20 or less. There was something very wrong about the guy running the place, and we all felt it. He sourced his workers from orphanages and other welfare organisations, and he claimed the workers were paid regardless of the number of incense sticks they
devaraja market
rolled, but I could tell by the young girl’s face that this wasn’t true. We might be wrong and he might have been a nice guy, but it speaks volumes that almost all twelve people in a group were creeped out by him. I was glad that no one bought anything from his business.

The usual suspects gathered for pre-dinner drinks at our hotel’s bar before our minibus drove us to Park Lane Restaurant for dinner. The rooftop restaurant setting was quite lovely and we had an enjoyable meal of aloo gobi (potato and cauliflower curry) with butter naans (leavened bread cooked in a wood fired oven) and parathas (naans stuffed with potato). We caught auto rickshaws (motorised tricycles with a passenger cabin) back to the hotel, had one last drink in the hotel bar before calling it a night.

Early the next morning, Andrew and I went for a walk around the hotel to find an ATM. We asked the bank guard for a chai (tea) stall recommendation and he pointed us in the direction of a small street just off the main road. The smaller streets were yet to awake and it was a nice quiet
devaraja market
walk. It was the second day of Pongal, and of the few people out and about, women were drawing rangoli designs on the footpaths in front of their houses while men were congregating at the chai shops.

Preethi Sagar Cafe was a busy little hive of a place with a constant stream of breakfast customers, but we weren’t hungry so we sat with our glasses of chai and people-watched. As was the case in all the smaller shops and cafes we went to, I was the only female present.

Later that morning we drove out into the countryside an hour from Mysore, to the Keshava Temple in Somanathapur. On the way we passed more farmland, mostly just-harvested rice fields that cattle were now being grazed on.

Keshava Temple is a beautiful example of Hoysala temple architecture from the 13th Century. It is enclosed within a high wall, and we entered the rectangular complex through a room with tall pillars. The temple is made of soapstone that has aged to a warm grey. While it is no longer active, the temple was once dedicated to Vishnu. There are three shrines which contained a statue each – two of
devaraja market
the statues are original, but the third was ‘taken by invaders’. Our guide was quite good and seemed to enjoy his job. It was a public holiday for Pongal, so the guide’s wife and three children joined us for the tour, and they were dressed in beautifully colourful festive clothes.

The Hindu faith is a way of life for most Indians, and our guide seemed determined that we grasped the basics of the religion – a religion characterised by millions of gods/goddesses and reincarnation leading to a better life. We learned about Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, along with their wives and children.

The three shrines have a striking star shaped design with highly decorative towers above them. The outside walls are covered in panels with decorative bands of friezes and carved reliefs. The panels have sculpted swans, yalis (part lion part horse mythical beasts), horsemen and a procession of elephants at the bottom. The other walls depicted detailed epics and stories from Hindu texts which were intricately and beautifully carved. The main hall, the three shrines and their associated rooms were all as decorative as the outside walls.

I liked these carvings more than many I’ve seen
devaraja market
in other Hindu temples, as they weren’t painted in garish colours. There was a symmetry and balance to the overall design that I loved, and there was also a very lovely ambience to this place. I think I would rate this as one of my favourite Hindu temples to date! 😊

On the way back to Mysore we stopped at the Red Pepper Restaurant for lunch. We all ordered the ‘veg thali’, which came with rice, paratha (naan stuffed with potato), vegetable soup, rasam (spicy tamarind broth), gobi Manchurian (spicy cauliflower stir-fry), paneer butter masala (Indian cottage cheese curry), dahl curry (lentil curry), beetroot poriyal (beetroot fried with coconut and spices), pickle, curd and a pappadam.

Back in Mysore, we visited the central Devaraja Market that specialised in fruit, vegetables and flowers. It was a riot of colour! My camera couldn’t keep up with the pace at which the market moved. The flower market was like nothing I’ve ever seen. There were whole rows of stalls that were dedicated to selling one or two specific flowers, and the negotiations between the merchants were loud and swift. The walkways were narrow and manic with men hurrying past with multiple
devaraja market
sacks on their backs or garlands of marigolds stacked high on hand carts. Andrew’s tall frame isn’t easily missed in an Asian market, but I frequently lost sight of him in the hustle and bustle. I’m not sure if the market is always that busy or if it was more hectic because of the Pongal festival.

We were catching an overnight train that evening, so our group was using two day rooms until we left. We got back to the hotel, showered and organised ourselves for the onward journey.

We had been invited to an early dinner at a local family home. The table for the thirteen of us took up the entire living space in their house. The couple’s two grown daughters had come over to help cook for us. Pressure cookers hissed and whistled in the kitchen, a sound I associated with my parent’s kitchen in my childhood. The meal was simple but delicious – an incredible vegetable biryani (a spiced rice dish cooked with vegetables), brinjal curry (eggplant/aubergine curry), chicken tandoori (roast chicken marinated with a special spice paste and yoghurt) and cucumber raita (yoghurt based sauce). If truth be told, I’m not a fan
devaraja market
of biryani... I find it dry and a bit ‘meh’, and the only time I really enjoyed it was in Malaysia, where they ‘flood’ the biryani with curry sauces. However, this version of biryani was quite moist and tasty. For dessert we were served a very sweet custard and gulab jamun (fried doughnut-like milk-based balls soaked in spiced sugar syrup). I haven’t talked about Indian desserts yet – they have coma-inducing amounts of sugar in them, so I’ve only been having a small serving – which is a first in all my travels!

On the way to the station we dropped in to see the lights of the palace before continuing on to catch the first of our two overnight trains in India. We got to the station and joined the masses of people rushing to get night trains to different destinations all over the country. I was pleasantly surprised that the Indian railway system was nowhere near as decrepit or disorganised as I had read it was.

Our packs fitted neatly underneath our seats. I’d heard of thefts on the trains, so if our packs had been too big to shove under the seats, I would have
devaraja market
shared my bed with my bag rather than leave it sitting in the walkway – one of the advantages of having short legs. 😊

The overnight train from Mysore to Chennai was supposed to take 11 hours. It was our sixth overnight train in Asia, but it was a first for some members of our travelling group. We were in second class 3AC, which was an air-conditioned carriage with berths containing three bunks on either side of the wall and two bunks opposite in the walkway. This is the first time we’ve had triple bunks, and I’m not sure which bunk I prefer. However, the top bunk is the most private, and you can lie down whenever you want to as it’s a standalone bunk. During the day the middle bunk is folded up and the bottom bunk acts as a seat for all three occupants. So depending on who you’re sitting with, you could be relegated to lying in your bunk very early in the journey rather than sitting comfortably until you’re ready to sleep. The ‘ladder’ for the upper bunks consisted of two very small rungs that jutted into the walkway, and in 3AC the top bunk
local family dinner
was pretty high... I’m surprised no one had an accident on descent. Andrew and I got the two bunks in the walkway, so the politics of the three bunk system didn’t apply.

Having learnt my lesson from overnight trains in Vietnam, I packed a few layers of clothing and a warm jacket for when the aircon was cranked to ‘arctic’. However, this train kept fairly warm all night. Sheets, pillows and blankets were provided and looked clean enough, but I’d packed my own tiny silk sleep-sheet which was very comfortable. I did a bit of writing in my upper bunk, but I drifted off to sleep as the train picked up speed and started swaying a bit. I woke up once during the night when the train stopped to pick up passengers, and the next time I woke was at 5am when we were nearing Chennai.

I was a little concerned about the stories I’d heard about ‘train mice’, and I can confirm that they do exist. I only saw one, and I had no other option but to ignore it and hope it didn’t pop into my upper bunk during the night! We’d already been warned about
mysore palace at night
not carrying any food in our packs or leaving any food on the floor.

Having had many conversations with friends and family about train toilets, I’d like to report that the toilets weren’t nearly as horrible as I’d imagined. They were ok-ish to begin with, but Andrew reliably informed me that they were a bit ‘messy’ as the trip wore on. As per my usual way of coping with train toilets, I tried not to drink too much, but I get headaches from being dehydrated, so I just had to get over it. As with most things, the reality is never as bad as the perception, and they really weren’t that bad when I used them at 5am. However, I think I went through a week’s supply of wet wipes and hand sanitizer in that one trip to the toilet.

If you want some ‘toilet tips for moving trains' – shoes are always better than thongs (flip flops) for obvious reasons; tight fitting leggings or trousers are better than floppy/baggy ones; and the squat toilets are far cleaner than the western-styled toilets. But let’s face it – neither option is going to be a very pleasant experience. But
overnight train
I lived. And I didn’t get Ebola. 😊

Our next stop is Chennai (Madras) on our way to the seaside village of Mamallapuram on the east coast of Tamil Nadu.

Home-stay
This is my first blog, although I have traveled alot but never thought of sharing my thoughts. I don’t know what drove me to write but I decided let’s start sharing my thoughts. So we 5 friends took self-drive car from Zoom cars and on 27thDec2014 midnight we left from Bangalore. We took the following route to reach Kemmanagundi

Bangalore-Tumkur-Gubbi-Tiptur-Arasikere-Kadur-Birur-Lingadahalli.

After Tumkur one needs to take a deviation from NH-4 and join NH-206.The traffic on this highway was relatively less compared to others. There is a stretch of 130km which is single lane and very beautiful. Around 4am we stopped in between on the highway and all of us shared all our experiences about life and one of our friend is singer who sang beautiful songs. Then we started again at 5am and then at Kadur we had tea. We then proceeded towards Birur, where one has to take a deviation towards left which leads to Lingadahalli. The road condition starts to deteriorate once the deviation is taken at Lingadahalli.This is the point where one can start getting the glimpses of the Kemmanagundi. One can see cloud covered hills and valleys creating a very beautiful view. The pollution free

Home-stay
environment, the chilling
weather, cool breeze added the excitement. After Lingadahalli one needs to take left turn on Sh-57 and follow the Karnataka tourism boards. We had already booked a home stay “Kanthi niwas” for us. The owner James was a very courteous man. We had our breakfast and then headed towards Kalhatti falls.

Kalhatti falls:

Kalhatti falls are situated in village named as Kalhattipura. The water here comes from height of 100+ meters in front of Veerabhadreshwara temple. One can see three elephants carved on the rocks right in front of the temple, over which the water falls. We then went to the top of the falls through the stone steps placed next to the falls to get view of the falls. There was very less water however we even enjoyed there and then returned back to our home stay to have our lunch and then we got ready to head towards Kemmanagundi hills.

Kemmanagundi hills:

We headed towards Kemmanagundi hills which were around 15kms from our home-stay. The road leading to Z point was really steep and had bad patches in between. We reached there in 45 minutes to enjoy the beautiful sunset, watching
IMG_2625
Sunset
the changing color of sky from orange to red to dark. The serene beauty and beautiful sky took our heart away. There is a Government guesthouse at that point. We then went back to our home-stay which took around 40 minutes to reach. James had arranged bonfire for us, we sang, danced had our dinner and then slept.

Next day morning we had our breakfast and we enjoyed cycling for some 4 to 5kms and played badminton and then headed back towards Bangalore.

selling flowers @ Krishnarajendra Market
Where should we stay in Bangalore? We had 2 options: a B&B which sounded quite promising bang in the middle of the town or a very promising B&B in Whitefield that was much cheaper and, to top it, one of the 30 most charming B&B in India (according to Conde Nast Traveller). We took the one that offered us a bed first with a lovely email: the Villa Camelotin Whitefield. And yes, living far out of the town was a disadvantage. But we were so lucky to have stayed in Villa Camelot - the advantages outweighed the disadvantages. Well, I will start from the beginning....

To reach Bangalore from Mysore is easy. Just go to the Central Bus Station in Mysore. There are buses departing nearly every 5 minutes. Within 2 hours we reached Bangalore and immediately got a first taste of what this city is about: constant traffic jam! It took us another hour to reach the centrally located bus terminal. We got of our bus and asked around for local buses in the direction of Whitefield. We had no idea where exactly our B&B was located. Whitefield is the IT area of Bangalore with lots of high tech industry
@ Krishnarajendra Market
as well as some excellent malls, restaurants etc.. It is quite a leafy area, but round about 16-20 ks away from downtown. We just knew this and had the address. So we wanted to reduce the rickshaw costs by simply covering most of the way by public transport. It was not a major problem. We found a Whitefield bound bus. The bus driver told us to get off at a certain point. And we were trying to get a rickshaw. That was difficult as all drivers obviously wanted to ripp us off. But with some patience we found a nice driver who even called our hosts and brought us there safely and by using the meter! A lucky punch. We were welcomed by the hosts Yamini and Raghu with a big hug, huge smiles and a steaming cup of hot chai. It was the warmest welcome we have ever had by arriving in an accomodation! And what an accomodation it was! Really nice decorated, all perfectly clean and our room was just amazing: huge, a great bathroom and an amazing shower. We did not get a key, as the room was simply part of the family house where we had
Kempfort Shiva Temple
a room with a bathroom. By stepping outside the room we were standing in the family living room and the kitchen. We were so happy to have chosen this place. For the rest of the afternoon we just relaxed by talking with our hosts. Amazing, how similar minded we were. Sometimes one has to travel half way around the globe to find some soulmates :-). The day went by, we made so amazing new friends and we still had no idea what to do and see in Bangalore. But we did not care. We all had dinner together. And had a perfect sleep in the comfy bed without any stains or bedbugs. Also next morning we took it slowly. After a great breakfast, Raghu drove us the 2 ks to the next bus stop. It was sunday, so it took us only 1 hour to reach town. We got off the bus close to the Garuda Mall. After so many spiritual place where we have been in the last days, we really enjoyed some extensive shopping experience. We walked around the MG Road area, a really beautiful part of Bangalore: new shopping malls for the middle class, tree lined streets
with our hosts Yamini and Raghu @ Villa Camelot in Whitefield
and clean streets! There were lots of fantastic restaurants and bars. Wow, this was a totally different part of India which we had not seen so far. This is modern India where even the girls walk around in short trousers. We also enjoyed the atmosphere of the city. It is ruled by business, but somehow people are relaxed, well educated and friendly. For lunch we managed to get a table in the famous and delicious Queen's Restaurant in Church Street. We had some typical south indian treats with veggy curries, dhal and fluffy and hot chapathi. YUMMY!

After lunch we walked around the Vittal Mallya Road area (Grant Road). Wow! Now we believe what we have heared so often: in India, there are living the poorest people as well as the richest people in the world. Well, we were walking among the richest part of Bangalore for sure. We visited the richest mall where we have ever been before (the Trump Center in New York is nothing against that). In our backpacker clothes we truly felt like being at the wrong place. But it was amazing for people watching. And the toilets were wonderful (I never believed I would
Garuda Mall
Bangalore CBD
ever say this about a toilet in India ;-)). Later we walked through the leafy Cubbon Park and passed the State Central Library, the Attara Kacheri (High Court) and the Vidhana Soudha (the government of Karnataka). All these were fantastic colonial buildings. Slowly we made our way back to MG Road and caught a bus back to Whitefield.

The next day, Monday, we naively thought to be back in town by bus in 1 hour. Well, it took us 2 hours! By midday we got of the bus in the Chickpet area. This is the wholesale area of Bangalore with old houses, narrow streets full of little lorries and rickshaws. It is busy, busy, busy. In the beginning we did not know how to take it all in. It was too much for our senses. But after a while it was great fun. We walked along the streets, visited some of the little shops til we finally reached Krishnarajendra Market, the oldest and busiest market in Bangalore. It was really old, but so wonderful. No need to mention that it was packed with people.... We continued with a visit to the old Fort of Bangalore and the Tipu Sultan's
downtown Bangalore
Palace. Unfortunately, it was already quite late, so the beautiful Venkataraman Temple (a Vishnu Temple) close to the Sultan's Palace was already closed. We took a rickshaw back to MG Road - and it took us 1 hour to cover the 6 ks. The traffic is unbelievable in this city. The streets are simply full with all means of transport. We had a quick bite to eat before we took a bus in the direction of Whitefield again. But this time we got off at the Kempfort Shiva Temple (which is about half way). This is a very special and beautiful Shiva Temple right behind a huge mall. We spend one hour in the temple. And then it was time to meet a friend. We met Shilpa in Madikeri for the first time at the Abbi Falls and later that day again in a temple in town. We became Facebook friends. When we wrote her that we are in Bangalore where she lives, we quickly found time to meet again. Together with a good friend of her, Niharika, we 4 went for dinner in a restaurant. Later we were invited to Shilpa's home to meet her mum and her brother.
modern indian ladies on MG Road
It was a great evening and the 2 ladies took great care of us. They even drove us around carefully on their scooters! Herewith we want to thank them again for the lovely evening!



On our last day in Bangalore we went again back to town by bus. OK, again it took us nearly 2 hours to reach the town. This time we went to the Commercial Street, a fantastic shopping street with small shops galore! Unfortunately, it was already too late to visit the Bangalore Palace. We skipped this one. instead we took a rickshaw and went to the Iskcon Bangalore. We both enjoyed the Iskcon temple in Mumbai a lot. The Bangalore temple is much bigger. And it is extremely beautiful. The walls and the ceilings are made of pure gold - and they are not covered with gold, it is solid gold! The murthis (statues of the deities) are also amazing! Wow, we were speechless. We spend some time there for meditation and an aarti. Then it was time to get a rickshaw to the central bus terminal and the bus to Whitefield. To reach our home it took us 3 hours! By that
MG Road shopping craziness
time we were really fed up with the traffic. We love Bangalore. Although there are not many touristic spots to visit, there are a lot of different things to see. We love these kind of cities where there is not much to do from a touristic point of things. But when you follow the suggestion of the locals it is a fantastic city. We had a fantastic homestay, met so many wonderful people. But the traffic is so horrible!

Bangalore has showed us a different kind of India, a modern face. In between our travels we were shocked so many times about the way even young people still think positively about the arranged marriage, about a lot old society rules and a lot of society pressure. These surely may exist in Bangalore as well. But there are a lot of well educated, very open minded young people that create the future of India in a very positive way. One can feel that they want to break out (and they do break out) of this pressure. And what is wonderful to observe, they are very proud to be part of a modern, forward looking India.

There is still a
Church Street
lot to see in Bangalore and we will come back for sure one day. Especially, to visit our new friends again who made our stay great (despite the traffic)! For sure, staying in the middle of town would have saved us a lot of hours on the bus, but we would not have met so amazing people! Thank you so much guys!

on Chamundi Hill
This is India: a temple, an old car and a cow combined with lots of people around
We thought it was a great idea to go to Chamundi Hill on New Year's Day. Well, we were not really the only ones having this idea. To put it shortly, Chamundi Hill was packed with people! We decided to take the foot trail up the hill. 1000-plus steps were awaiting us..... and lots of other pilgrims. Most pilgrims blessed each step with some kumkum (red and yellow powder). We just tried to make our way up quietly which was difficult with lots of people wishing us a happy new year and wanting to shake our hands. We did not want to be rude and started to play the game with them. But after I do not know how many people and pictures we gave up. We really felt extremely bad but there was no chance to arrive on top of the hill in 1 day with being friendly to all the people. After 2/3 of the way we arrived at the huge statue of Nandi, Shiva's bull. It is a really impressing statue being carved out of a solid rock in 1659.



The platform on top of Chamundi Hill was full with people, sellers, cows and cars.
Yoganarashima Temple in Melkote
As we have been here a year before we were not too shocked and made our way to a swami who was giving some blessings. We received our blessing and then decided to buy an express ticket to enter the temple. Without an express ticket we would have had to wait for 3 hours in a squeezed queue. Still it took us about 40 minutes to enter the temple. Once in the temple, it was a fight to receive the darshan of the devi with all the people pushing and squeezing each other. But we were lucky and even got some space to stand still in front of the deity. Again outside, we relaxed with a fresh coconut in the shade before making our way to 2 other temples on the hill. These ones were beautiful but small and both of them really packed with people. In one temple I was squeezed in between a door and people; I could hardly breeze any more and I gave up. This is crazy! Finally we had enough of the crowd and took a public bus down the hill and back to downtown Mysore. We had a relaxing lunch on a rooftop terrace
lunch time in Melkote
overlooking Gandhi Square. Fresh fruit juices, kofta, curries, kulchas and dal - what a start of the new year. In the afternoon we just walked around the little streets in Mysore and took in the wonderful atmosphere of this amazing city. As we had already been to the palace a year ago we really took it easy this time. A visit to the Philomena's Cathedral and a walk over the Devaraja Market was enough tourist activity for us. For the rest of the day we went shopping. In the evening we had dinner at the famous RRR Hotel. The Thali is really good and cheap - but it is extremely spicy! So if you decide to check it out, be prepared!



The next day we were longing for getting out of the busy city again. We needed some country quietness again. We took a bus from the public bus stand to Jakkanahalli from where we took a rickshaw up to the pilgrimage village of Melkote. Melkote is a devout Vishnu pilgrimage village. It is home to the 12th-century Cheluvanarayana Temple with its rose-coloured gopuram (gateway tower). It is a really peaceful town and we loved it instantly
Nina doing some pranayamas on the hill in Melkote - a perfect place
when we arrived. Each house is decorated with the symbols of vishnu and nearly all people walk around having the vishnu tilak on their forehead. We bought some offerings for a pooja at a stand from a friendly lady outside the Cheluvanarayana Temple. She put some flowers in my hair - she was so cute and lovely! Then we went into the temple. It was nearly empty! A wonderful temple with lots of great carvings and pillars. The deities were extremely beautiful. We made our pooja, received prasad (blessed food) and could quietly meditated. Finally we sat down on the floor as 2 ladies were singing some bhajans. It was very atmospheric and we enjoyed it very much. After the temple visit we walked around the village which is really small. As the other temple up on the hill was closed around lunch till 5pm we had a lot of time. And it was obvious that there is not much to see and to do in the village. So we first tried to find a place for having lunch. That was quite difficult. We discovered 2 restaurants and some small, dirty street food stalls. As one restaurant was empty and
start of the stairs up to Chamundi Hill
Mysore
did not look very inviting, we went to the New Sampathkumar Restaurant. Some families were having lunch there - a good sign. It was a simple, dark but clean place. There was just one dish: a veg thali. Perfect! No spoons, no fork - it was time to eat with our fingers. And the thali was delicious. And a lot! For less than 2$ we were really full and happy! After lunch we relaxed a bit at the Kalyani. A crew was filming a bollywood movie there and we just watched all the people watching the filming. It was good fun. Finally we walked up the hill to the old Yoganarashima Temple. We still had 1 hour left till the temple opened again. So we sat down, enjoyed the views over Melkote and the surrounding hills, meditated and slept a little bit. Also this temple was beautiful with only few people around. It is a very old temple and really difficult to maintain. All offerings, water and so on has to be carried each day up the steps! I was really worth visiting this village which is far away of the beaten track and it even happened to us that
people blessed each step on their way up to Chamundi Hill
people wanted to touch our skin as they had never seen white people before. ;-)



The bus ride back to Mysore took us again 1,5 hours. We had a last dinner before we packed our backpacks again. It was time to move on. Our next destination: Bangalore!

Gumbaz
the resting place of the legendary Tipu Sultan, his father and his wife
Leaving Hassan after our great day in Shravanabelagola our next destination was Mysore, a city where we have been before (here is our last blog of Mysore). We had an Ok place to stay last time in Mysore but this time we wanted to be a bit closer to town. That is why we ended up in the famous MB International Hotel. It was indeed close to town, just a 10 minutes walk away from the Central bus stand. We were welcomed very friendly - our room was small but looked clean and ok. We were relieved as we had booked 4 nights here. We went for a quick walk around town and a bite to eat for dinner. As we had planned a special trip for the next day, we went to bed early - well, we tried to! When we entered into our room and switched on the lights we saw some small bugs running around in the bed. The very first time on our trips: bedbugs!!!!! We quickly killed the 5 bugs we saw and went down to the reception. They immediately offered us a new room, were very friendly and even helped us to move our unpacked stuff. You can immagine - in the
in the Jamia Masjid
next room we carefully checked the matrasse and the sheets, but everything looked fine. We were just very lucky that we discovered the bedbugs before going to bed! The rest of the night was quiet and bugfree ;-).



The following day we got up early, had a quick breakfast and went down again to the bus stand to catch a bus to Srirangapattana which is about 16 km away from Mysore. You can get on all the Bangalore bound buses which depart like every 5 minutes. So that was easy. After 40 minutes we arrived in Srirangapattana. Our reason for visiting this historical fort town was not its bloody history but the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple. For the deity of Sri Ranganathna, a manifestation of Mahavishnu (it is the lying form of Narayana) there are only five sacred sites of worship in India. They are together called Pancharanga Kshetram. One of theses places is this temple.



We entered the historical part of town by foot through the fort walls. First we came across the beautiful Jamia Masjid, a cream-coloured mosque with 2 minarets. There, you can walk upstairs and enjoy a nice view over the
washing day at the river
area. Unfortunately the weather was quite cloudy. We kept walking and passed Tipu's place of death (the place where famous Tipu Sultan was found after he had died). It is a peaceful little garden. Close by were the old police headquarters and the Water Gate. We continued our walk to Colonel Bailey dungeon where we sat down at the river observing the locals: kids were playing in the water, women doing some washing, some guys were cleaning themselves and others were washing dishes... From here it was a quick walk to the temple. We bought some offerings for the pooja and went in. Luckily, it was not very crowded. We had to wait in a queue for 20 minutes but without much hassle and much pushing. The temple is really beautiful with a huge statue of Sri Ranganathna. Actually the statue is a manifestation and not made by men! Really impressive! A swami made the pooja for us and we could feel a lot of power and energy this time. We even found some space to quietly sit down and meditate. It was really a wonderful experience. Inside, there was also a temple for Mahalakshmi, the goodess of inner and
Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple
outer wealth and health. We could also do a pooja for her which was amazing. With many blessings and a really great experience we relaxed a little bit in the temple garden. We walked around the temple clockwise 1 time - this burns karma! And it is always good to loose some ;-)...... This was really the first temple, where we quietly could spend our time. Amazing!



After leaving the temple it was time for lunch. As everything is really spread out in Srirangapattana, we took a rickshaw to the Mayura River View Hotel. That was an excellent choice for having lunch. They have a nice terrasse overlooking the holy river Cauvery. The atmosphere was tranquil and peaceful, food was decent and later we could sit along the river and enjoy the sound of frogs. But, as there is more to see, we took the chance to visit some more places. First, Tipu's Summer Palace. It is a nice palace in a beautiful garden. But from the outside it is far less impressive than the Mysore Palace. Anyway, the interior which is made of 90% painted wood, is really amazing. Our last stop of the day was
entrance to the fort town of Srirangapattana
the Gumbaz, where Tipu Sultan is resting together with his father and his wife. The building is amazing and also the nearby mosque Masjid-E-Aska is worth a visit. As we walked to most of the sights we were really tired. We went back to the bus stand by rickshaw and quickly got a bus back to Mysore.



And it was new year's eve! So we had a quick shower and went down to town. There was nothing happening in town for new year's eve. Just some big hotels were having crazy parties where one could spent a lot of money. So we decided to have dinner in the tourist spot: the Parklane Hotel. Food is a bit expensive here, but the atmosphere is nice, the guests were totally mixed (some locals, some tourists) and we met a german lady. We talked, exchanged some travelling stories.... - till finally it was midnight. We welcomed the new year with some ginger tea! Wow, how healthy do we live in the meantime ;-)! The funny thing was that 10 minutes after midnight, the restaurant was closing already. So we even had an early night, as the streets were quiet and
selling fish in the plain heat without cooling
we are happy to be vegetarians...
really nothing was going on. New Year's celebration in Mysore is not a big deal - even the palace was not lightened.



Well, it was a great day to end the year 2014 and a nice and quiet start into 2015. Let's see what the new year has in store for us.... More about our time in Mysore soon...

feet of the Gomateshwara statue in Shravanabelagola
After our ""shithole experience"" in Halebid (read in our last blog entry), we did not feel like staying overnight in another pilgrimage town. Furthermore, the sleeping options in Shravanabelagola sounded, well let's say, limited. Most of the guesthouses are for pilgrims and are rented by the local jain organisation for as little as 210 rupees for a double. So we made the trip to Shravanabelagola from Hassan in 1 day - and it was a perfect decision. But as this place was an extraordinary place for us, we feel like giving it some space in an extra blog.

Why did we chose to go to Shravanabelagola? On this trip we wanted to visit some smaller, remoter places around Mysore as this area is considered to be kind of a holy area with lot of sacred places and a special energy. Shravanabelagola was supposed to be one of these places. It is famous for the huge, 17.5m-high statue of the Jain deity Gomateshvara. The statue is said to be the tallest monolithic one in the world and it is carved out of a single piece of granite.

To get there was quite easy. Well, very, very few western tourists come here, but lots of indian
Markus and some random indians taking pictures of us
ones. Therefore, the bus connections are perfect. From the Hassan bus terminal we took a local bus to Channarayapatna. It was a quick ride of about 40 minutes on the main Mysore-Bangalore highway. In Channarayapatna all signs were only written in Kannada (the local language). Bad luck for us. Also, people do not really speak english here. But somehow we managed to find a local bus to Shravanabelagola. It was another 30 minutes on the bus through beautiful, rural landscape. The whole trip set us back about 1 US$ per person one way - that looked like another really cheap day!

By arriving in Shravanabelagola one can see the huge statue already from far away. The little town is nestled in between two holy hills (Vindhyagiri und Chandragiri), lots of big boulders and some small beautiful lakes. We were much surprised how beautiful it was! We decided first to climb up Vindhyagiri hill where the big statue of Gomateshwara is. Entrance was free (!) but you have to pay a small amount to leave you shoes at the foot of the temple (you must climb the mountain barefoot). The barefoot walk uphill was pleasant beside hordes of school children
landscape around Shravanabelagola
and families constantly asking us for pictures. Next time we will come prepared - we are seriously thinking of wearing a T-shirt saying ""picture - 10 rupee, video - 20 rupee, touching skin - 100 rupee, screaming right into my ear for a picture - 1000 rupee"" ;-)..... Anyway - if you walk up the hill in the warm season at midday, consider wearing some socks as the rock really gets hot. You quickly get an amazing view over town. On the way up, there are some small temples and viewpoints. The statue cannot be seen while walking up. Only by entering the main temple you suddenly stand right in front of the amazing statue of the naked Gomateshvara. Oh yes, although we are in India, the jain deity is completely naked - and yes, you can see everything! No wonder, you can hear a lot of giggeling of school classes, especially with girls only.... whereas most married couples just overlook the detail a bit ashamed. It was very funny to watch the reaction of the people, we have to admit. Anyway, the place has a nice atmosphere and some strong energy around. The statue is amazing. Every 12 years
Markus with Shravanabelagola and Chandragiri hill in the background
there is a Mastakabishekam and millions of people come there. That means that the statue is dowsed in holy waters, yoghurt, kumkum powder etc.. What we have seen on youtube , they need tons and tons of milk and other things. Well, the next ceremony will be in 2018. We enjoyed the place and tried to sit in a more or less quiet corner - but that was nearly impossible. But this is India....

We walked down again and quickly left the stalls and the hassle of the sellers around the entrance behind us. For lunch we tried the Raghu Hotel. This hotel is the only decent sleeping option here. Well, let's say, this time we were glad we had chosen to stay in Hassan! But lunch was more than amazing! They have only jain food, that means, no animal products are used in the food. It is purely vegan. Great for us, as we are strict vegetarians (althouh not vegans). We ordered a thali which was a huge, really tasty and so cheap. The owner was very friendly and chatted with us - well, not a lot of westeners do come here. So he was extremely pleased to
we loved the first aid kits on the buses ;-)
welcome us.

In the afternoon we climbed Chandragiri hill. This hill is nearly deserted. We met 5 people there in the afternoon - not more. It was stunning. We had amazing views of the statue on the other hill, of the town and all the surrounding area. It was so peaceful and quiet!!!! On top is the Chandragupta Basti, a lot of very old jain temples. Actually, these are some of the oldest jain temples in India. The atmosphere was amazing as were the temples. Some of them had a very good energy. Entrance again was free and we visited 11 temples in total and one cave. It was just fantastic and we spend all afternoon there. In the evening we went back to town and took a bus back to Channarayapatna and then to Hassan.

What a cheap an fulfilled day it was! We can highly recommend spending a day in Shravanabelagola. In the evening we had another fantastaic dinner at the Mayura International Hotel in Hassan. Then it was time to pack our backpacks again. Our next destination is a place where we have been already 1 year ago and which we loved: Mysore!

we simply could not read the timetable...

Sharavanbelagola
View from hill top at sharavanbelagola
This blog is dedicated to the Ancient Hoysala Empire - its capital Halebidu and Belur.

28th Dec 2014 sunday morning and a destination 260 kms away from Bengaluru city was picked up as a weekend getaway by us.

We covered total 3 places in a day's tour to belur - Halebidu. Our trip started at 6 am from bengaluru. Our first stop was Sharavanbelagola(140 kms from Bangalore)- a very old jain temple. As soon as we got out of our car we figured out reaching to the temple will not be an easy task, as there were 150 stairs waiting for us. Somehow we managed with 4-5 breaks in between. After reaching the cliff our tiredness was taken away by the temple's design and architecture. After covering the entire courtyard and the temple we quickly rushed down as we were running on a tight schedule.



We then drove another 120 km to reach to the First Hoysala Empire capital - Belur.

Belur: Home to the Hoysala temple complex. The Chennakeshava temple here was completed in 1116 by Hoysala Vishnuvardhana. The temple is 37 meters tall and is standing on a platform which has exquisite art
Belur
Courtyard at Belur - capital of hoyasala
work on its outer walls and bracket figures of dancing girls in various poses in perfect proportion. The temple here is a classic example of Hoysala art, and Belur was one of the Hoysala Capitals. After spending nearly 1.5 hours we still were not able to capture the mind-blowing architecture and sculptures.



Our third and last stop was Halebidu - the later capital of Hoysala.

Halebidu was the regal capital of the Hoysala Empire in the 12th century. It is home to some of the best examples of Hoysala architecture. Most notable are the ornate Hoysaleswara and Kedareswara temples. The city which was originally called Dorasamudra got the name ""Halebidu"" because it was ransacked two times during the invasion of Malik Kafur.

The entire trip got us pretty close to the Hoysala empire and their art forms. while we headed back to Bengaluru city - we had so much to talk about the sculptures and architecture of these places. A must visit place in south India - all 3 destinations can be comfortably covered in a day's time.

paper dosa for breakfast - we loved it.
What a perfect start of the day......
OK, the headline is quite provocative. We do have some indian friends who are spiritual. So please, we do not want to offend anyone. We are just talking about the mass of people and what we observed on our travels. But later some thought on this.



From Madikeri we took one of the many buses down to Hassan. If you want to travel this route: just be warned! The road is really bad and during these 4 hours we were shaken quite a bit. But again we had been lucky, having seats in the front of the bus with great views. We arrived at the bus station in Hassan and were really surprised how clean and well organized this bus station is. As it was early afternoon, we quickly decided to make our way to Halebid. Our plan was to visit the Hoysala temples in Halebid and Belur the following day and we were afraid that we would not make it in one day. So we decided to move on to Halebid to save some time instead of stay in Hassan for the night. Well, to be honest, that was one of the worst decisions we made on
it is orange season - as you can see on the market in Hassan
this trip. The bus ride to Hassan was only 1 hour on a full and dusty bus. We arrived in Halebid and quickly found the only decent hotel in this grab little town, the Mayura Shantala Hotel. Unfortunately, it was fully booked. Really bad luck for us, as there was only one alternative: the Shree Lodge a few meters away. Already from the outside we knew it - that was about to be a horrible experience. But we had no alternative. They had a free room (well, no one is staying there voluntarily) for only 400 Rupees. At least, it was cheap (even though for the shithole we got, we should have paid not more than 100 Rupees). The lodge is about 10 years old, we guessed. When it was new, they put on some bedsheets and never changed them again. The bathroom looked about the same (like being cleaned for the last time about 10 years ago). We just left our stuff there and decided not to spend more time than really necessary in this shithole.



For sunset we went to visit the famous Hoysaleswara Temple. The temple was full of people especially school classes. But
construction work in a bus terminal near Hassan
it is really impressive and beautiful. The construction of the temple began around 1121 and went on for 190 years. It was never really completed. But still today the temple is a masterpiece of Hoysala architecture. The outside walls of the temple are richly sculpted and are covered with Hindu deities, sages, stylised animals and Hoysala rulers. There are also 2 statues of Nandis (Shiva's bull) facing the inner sanctum of the temple. The whole temple is in the middle of a nice and well kept garden. It would have been wonderful and we could feel a very good energy in the temple. The only problem were the hordes of school classes and families. The closer we went to the inner sanctum of the temple, the louder they became. For us, a temple is a place for meditation, a place of peace. For 99% of the visitors the visit to the temple was a big event. They spoke loudly, took pictures and always asked us for pictures. One moment, I was kneeing down in front of the main deity for praying, some guys were standing beside me asking me for a picture. It opened our eyes to the fact, that

India is indeed a holy country. But there are not more spiritual people in India than in the rest of the world. They are born Hindus, they obey to the religious rules and ceremonies, but they are definitely not more or less spiritual than other people. We were kind of shocked. In fact it was really annoying as we could not find a place to quietly sit for a while and taking it all in. We tried to loudly recitate some mantras - but people were ignorant to that. They kept asking us for pictures, pushing us, shouting at us all the time. In a far corner of the garden they finally left us in peace. We sat there and thought about the indians, their religion and their lifes.



Some of our thoughts to India and religion: as we had experienced especially in Kerala, a very conservative part of India, people try everything to fullfill the social norm. They do not show any kind of emotions. Still, 90% of the marriages are arranged and especially younger people are extremely unhappy with that. But the fear of being an outsider of society and the fear of not fulfilling
traffic jam - view from the bus
the karma is to big to change the situation. Oh yes, they think, obeying their parents and getting married to a random woman/man is their karma. But this is only society pressure. And this again is caused by the way religion is lived today. Spirituality goes beyond this. In spirituality one follows the heart. Because the heart is never wrong. It maybe wrong in concern of the society rules but not for oneself. Of course, this is the more difficult way as one has to face his own problems and his own decisions. Anyway, this is a thinking most of the people do not understand (or they do not want to hear that). We met some people on our trip who already have realised this problem of the society and who have solved it for themselves. They opened their hearts, made their own decisions and are highly spiritual people (and we are not talking about some saints or gurus, just ""normal"" people). Some of them nearly never go to temples as it is always to loud, to crowded and full of people not caring for others. They agreed to our thoughts. One wonderful lady even said: ""It is crazy. In
Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebid
India, we live in a holy country. And all the people want to go to the gym, train in Zumba, drink and party. And all the westeners come here and bring us back the spirituality. They look for peace of mind, they visit temples in a way, they do yoga and eat real ayurvedic food."" The world is indeed crazy. Just some thoughts......



Back to our trip. As the sun was setting down, we left the temple and went for a walk around Halebid town. Well, this was done in 10 minutes as it is mainly just one dusty main street. There is another, very colourful temple, the Kedareswara Temple, which was quite peaceful and nice to visit. That's it. So Markus decided to take the time for a haircut in one of the streetside shacks. For 60 Rupees he got a perfect cut and the time was coming closer when the only restaurant in the big hotel opened. We had dinner (it was quite ok) and then went back to our awful room. We put our sarongs on the bed and did not even get undressed. It was one of these moments when you try not
details of the Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebid
to touch anything. The flush of the toilet was not working anymore. But luckily we did not need it too much anyway. ;-) The night nevertheless was ok, we slept well. We got up the next morning very early as we wanted to escape out of our room quickly. At that time we even did not have any running water at all. We just put the few things we unpacked together and left at 6 am. From the bus terminal we took the first bus to Belur. It was about 40 minutes. There we went to Mayura Velapuri Hotel for having a nice breakfast. It was delicious and we could even wash ourselves in the bathroom. Luckily, we could leave our luggage there while visiting the temple. We were happy again.



And off we went to the Channakeshava Temple. On our way we realised that Belur is much bigger and much more pleasant than Halebid. We should have stayed here. Well, sometimes you make stupid decisions.... The temple was simply stunning and even worth spending the night in a shithole for it. In fact, there are different smaller temples around the main temple. It was also very
details of the Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebid
crowded. But most of the people and school classes just visited the main temple. Like this, the other temples were peaceful and quiet. We spend a lot of time in the temples and could even meditate without being disturbed. Again, the architecture was stunning. The carvings and scultpures on the walls left us speachless. In some smaller temples ceremonies were going on and visitors even got blessings. Wonderful.



Finally, we took our backpacks from the hotel and went to the bus station again. It was 1 hour by bus till we reached Hassan. From there we took a rikhshaw that brought us to the Mayura International Hotel . We had read good reviews about it on tripadvisor. As the prize was reasonable we just gave it a try. It was like entering into paradies for us. They had a huge and cheap room available. As it was quite cold a night we did not need an AC room, so it was even cheaper. Everything was well kept and extremely clean. The towels were not stained, the bedsheets nicely white (!) and the bathroom had a wonderful hot shower. It was the first ""normal"" (that means no bucket shower) hot
Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebid
shower after 4,5 weeks! Wow!!!!! After the previous night we felt like kings. We showered, washed all our stuff and went down to the restaurant for lunch. Another surprise. This restaurant was excellent! Never before did we have such a great variety of freshly cooked, vegeterian indian food. And sooooo tasty! Later, we discovered that a lot of well-off families from Hassan come here for eating as well. Well, accomodation is sometimes a lottery while travelling. This time, we got the jackpot. We went for a walk around Hassan. There is nothing to see in Hassan but it is ok for some cheap shopping. Later, we had more wonderful food for dinner before we simply relaxed in our room.



To some it up: the temples in Halebid and Belur are worth a visit. But base yourself in Hassan and make a daytrip. Both temples can easily be visited in 1 day.



The next day we made a day trip to the pilgrimage town of Sravanabelagola. More about this in another blog....

Day 8
We had a relaxed morning this morning; waking up naturally, which was a refreshing change! Although we were awoken in the night by a random phone call. I answered it half asleep. It was all in Indian, I just kept replying that I didn't understand, but he continued to rabble on. Very frustrating, T found it very funny! lol
We packed our bags ready to move on again. We met with Kate and Nicola for our final breakfast before parting our ways. It was a hearty English breakfast this morning, well, as English as it gets in India! Cereal, fruit, toast with jam and tea.
We set of for Bangalore, which is abut 150k. We have a couple of stops on the way.
The first stop was after only 10 minutes whilst still in Mysore. It was at a beautiful Catholic Church. We weren't allowed inside as the service had already started, but the doors were open, it was amazing inside, as well as outside.
Then back in the car for 15km to the Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary. We saw lots of varieties of birds on our boat trip in the sanctuary, and a few crocodiles, although only from a
image
distance. Before leaving we fit in one last palace, The Palace of Tipu Sultan.
In Bangalore, we leave Kate and Nicola, they are getting the sleeper bus to Goa, whereas Tom and I are getting a local bus to Chennai. We will stay there overnight before flying to Goa the following day, my birthday!
With Nijams help we found the correct sleeper bus to Chennai. We arrived safely in Chennai.... Early! It was quite an experience waiting in the rain for Muhto to find us, which he did about an hour later. We arrived at our, very nice looking hotel, then went straight to our room. We sat for a couple of hours, just chatting, drinking tea, and putting the world to rights. Another good day!

Hawa Mahal, Jaipur
We leave Jaipur with a slight sense of relief at quitting the city and are soon back in the dusty fields of rural India. David is ecstatic having learned at 2am that Everton had eliminated Chelsea in the 5thround of the FA Cup. For the first half of our journey we enjoy the luxury of a 4 lane highway where the flyovers through the villages have actually been completed. This boosts our average speed no end and is a welcome change from our previous trips. But, as Pramod reminds us, “In India no road rules local people very bad driving”. You cannot relax for a minute, three twenty ton trucks may be just around the corner bearing down on you on your side of the road because they cannot be bothered to go the long way round to get onto the right carriageway.

We stop at the Abhaneri stepwell, which is reckoned to be the largest stepwell in the world. It is thought to be around 1200 years old. It has 13 flights of steps, with several triangles of steps in each layer, going down 65 feet to a tank where the water is 30 feet deep. The depth and
Abhaneri step well
design means the water is always cool. It is a mystery why such a small backwater ever needed such a huge well. There is a small Vishnu temple nearby which is being rebuilt somewhat ineptly by the ASI.

Further along the road we reach the village of Rajgarh, above which looms a ruined 18th century fort that was formerly the capital of Alwar that merits a mention in the guidebook. Pramod gamely tries to drive us to it, much to the bemusement of the simple village people who live in the village at the foot of the hill. We make our way ever more slowly through increasingly rutted and narrow roads, stopping every 100 yards to check the way. According to Pramod the locals do not even seem to recognise the Hindi works he uses to describe it. It seems almost as if they do not know what it is or even that it exists. It gradually dawns on all of us that this is wholly impractical and access impossible. It becomes clear that any road will stop well short of the fort, and neither of us feel like a steep hike up several hundred feet to check out
Hill Fort, Kesroli
the ruins. We retrace our steps and are soon in our penultimate hotel, the Hill Fort in Kesroli. As the name suggests, this too is a fort, built in the 14th century and converted into a hotel 15 years ago. Our room is on the top of the battlements, and the small lad charged with taking our luggage to the room almost keels over as he staggers up the steep, narrow flight of stone stairs to our room. He earns his tip.

From our own personal turret top, we look out over the small village below, and beyond to fields and a small line of hills. In this direction, it looks as if nothing has changed in India for decades. A woman milks her cow which is kept in the tiny courtyard in front of her house. The calf has to be shooed to one side. Next door, a woman in a bright red and green sari scrambles nimbly up a bamboo ladder that creaks and flexes as she progresses up it to the roof where she checks whether the washing has dried. It has. She throws it down to the courtyard and clambers perilously off the stone parapet
Birdies on patrol
back on the ladder, pausing occasionally to lift the hem of her sari before she trips on it. We hold our breath anxiously until she is down safely. All the village houses have flat roofs, which are used for storing wood and hay, hanging out the washing or simply as extra living space. One roof even has a small hut built of branches – maybe the Indian equivalent of the garden shed for when the husband is in the doghouse or simply needs some peace?

But it’s not all rural idyll. If you look further afield, you can see half a dozen tall skinny chimneys belching out smoke, all denoting small scale brickworks. And up the road there is a half finished development of modern flats, described as a luxury residency. The town is encroaching fast.

It’s a small scale manifestation of a much bigger clash of cultures in India, between ancient and modern, urban and rural. Every time we read an Indian newspaper, that clash leaps out. A single page of one paper included the following: a city-bred heritage enthusiast rediscovering an ancient pilgrimage trail between Rishikesh and Kedarnath; 500 crore rupees spent in Agra but sewer
Smoke stacks from the Fort
lines remain a mess; a village woman was set on fire by a distant relative after he tried but failed to rape her; an 8 year old’s hands were burnt to force him into begging, and a village elder has banned the use of mobile phones by girls younger than 18 to avoid them being spoiled, in direct opposition to Narendra Modi’s ambitious project to connect each citizen with smartphones under the Digital India initiative. Oh and there is the usual diet in the papers of honour killings or disfigurements for falling in love with someone from the wrong caste or someone the family disapproves of : brother and father on sister, mother on daughter, and any such combination, it is not just men on women but women on women too. Most of the people we have met have been helpful and friendly to an extreme, but even Sara, dressed practically to avoid sunburn and not to be alluring, often feels discomfited by a stare held for too long by young men. David on the other hand just enjoys being the subject of curiosity. In the villages children who ask you to take their photo really do just want to
Abhaneri step well steps
see the image briefly. But in the towns, there are still a lot of beggars, and people ask to have their photo taken and then demand money.

young monk at Bylakuppe
No, we did not pay for this picture! ;-). This guy was just cute and happy that we took a picture of him.
Leaving Kannur in the direction of Madikeri, I (Nina) had to face a special challenge. After having changed my ayurvedic medicine the evening before (as prescribed by the doctors), I had quite a strong diarrhea. As I felt healthy and ok, I did not pay much attention to it, but a 6 hour bus journey was not really what I was looking for. Anyway, we were lucky. Being the first ones on the bus, we were sitting in prime position in the front row with a perfect view. After 1 hour of travelling, we realised that theses seats were essential for a good journey. The driver was driving like crazy and the road was really curvy. The result: we were nearly the only one not feeling sick and not in need of some sickness bags. Instead we were enjoying the drive up the Western Ghats. As the bus had no windows anyway and the engine was very noisy, we did not even hear or smell that the co-passengers were all doing really miserable. Even my colon was quiet. Luck was on our side this time.



After nearly 6 hours we arrived in the dusty town of Madikeri which
Bylakuppe - in the smaller temple
is nestled in between beautiful rolling hills. The landscape looked amazing. We went out to look for a rickshaw and easily got one to a fair prize to get to our final destination: the Rainforest Retreat , an ecolodge tucked away in the forest. The ride on the rickshaw was nearly 1 hour and really bumpy (which woke up my colon and I had to train some specific muscles ;-)). But it was worth it. We arrived at the remote lodge. Our small and rustic cottage was a 15 minute walk away from the dining area and the middle of nowhere. We had our own fireplace in the room, an outdoor bathroom (the first thing I saw in the cottage). We got hot water for the shower by heating a huge bowl of water on the open fire (there is a solar panel solution, but we did not have enough sun those days) - and then it was a bucket shower. GREAT - and a real adventure. All the food is grown biologically on the farm - and one can taste this. Everything was so delicious. But still - there was one problem: my diarrhea. After dinner it got really bad
hiking in Coorg
and because of all my surgeries some years ago, I got quickly dehitrated. As we were really remote in the forest, I decided to be safe and go to the hospital as I did not know why I had this problem. I driver of the lodge took us there. Well, it was a private hospital and the first thing I thought was: ""oh my good, I do not want to see a public hospital then...."". I had to lay down on a bed which, well, more than stained. The doctor came in quickly wearing a battle dress. No angel in white - this guy was ready for a fight! It made me laugh. But he was friendly, checked me and said: you must stay here for the night. Well, I first wanted to know what my problem was. His quick answer was: food poisoning. OK, finally we agreed that I could take some medicine especially for the dehidration and we went back to the lodge. I really did not feel sick enough to stay in this place. After returning and taking the medicine, I quickly felt better and had a good sleep. Some days later I discovered that the cause
Coorg flower
of my problems was not food poisoning at all. My poor stomach simply did not like a specific ayurvedic tablet - that was all. So, all problems solved and after a tough start in the Coorg we finally could enjoy this wonderful place.

The first day we took it really easy. A nice breakfast with homemade bread, curries, idly, fresh fruits and self-crown tea was followed by some hammock time. After a wonderful lunch (I was feeling much better at that time) we went for a walk around the hills of the lodge before we enjoyed a nice bonfire. At night it was getting freezing cold (around 0-10 degrees). We had not been really prepared for this, but the open fire helped a lot. The other guests were a great mixture of indians and westeners and we were all talking and exchanging our stories. These evenings were really like what travelling is all about. Wonderful! This was christmas eve. We slept to the sound of frogs, crickets, wild dogs and other animals. What can you wish more for christmas!

The following day, christmas day, we had our own driver who took us to Bylakuppe where the Golden Temple
coconut seller near Iritty
on the way from Kannur to Madikeri in the Western Ghats
and the buddhist monastry is. It was cheaper, faster and easier to have our own driver than to take a riskshaw to town and a bus to Kushalnagar and another rickshaw to Bylakuppe. And, we could also go and visit other places with our own driver as well - so, no question what to do. It was kind of funny to celebrate christmas in the buddhist temple together with hordes of indian tourists. The monastry was stunning and had a great energy. The temples were so beautiful! It took us quite some time to leave the place again. On our way back we stopped at the Abbi Falls, a nice but not really spectacular waterfall near Madikeri, before we had lunch in Madikeri. After lunch we headed to the Rajas Seat, a nice garden overlooking the hills and Madikeri. It was a bit too crowded for our taste. Finally we also visited the oldest temple of the region, the Omkhareshwara Temple, in the heart of Madikeri. It is a beautiful and really well maintained temple. Even non-Hindus were allowed to participate in the ceremony. So we got darshan (blessing). We ended the day with a visit at a small and
our bus drivers seat
and this was a good one!
hidden temple in the sacred forest. This temple a a really powerful energy and the surroundings were so peaceful. Overmore, no one was around, we were the only ones. It was a perfect day which ended with a wonderful dinner and lots of laughing with the other guests.

On our last day we went on a guided hike (it was included in the accomodation). It was a beautiful 3 hour hike up a hill with stunnning views. This part of India is wonderful and so far away of the hassle, the noise and the pollution. We loved every second. After a big lunch we relaxed in the hammocks for the rest of the day. We did not really want to leave the following day. Just the cold and the humidity at night was really getting to us and we had no spare clothes left. So after 4 nights we left paradies for a warmer climate.

Many thanks to Dave, Laurie, Sujata and the rest of the Rainforest crew who made our stay so wonderful and who took great care of us!

gorkarna
So it's another bus ride from Hampi to Gorkarna, luckily I'm making the journey with a friend I've made in Hampi. There was no sleeper tickets available for the bus, so I'm sat upright all night trying to fucking sleep! No chance! We have to change bus at 2AM, and get onto what from the outside was a minivan, inside they'd managed to cram as many seats as a small airplane, goodbye knees. What I didn't realise before starting the journey was that it's only two hours on from this point, so we pay an extra 100rs each to get dropped at Om beach, meant to be really quiet and so named because it's in the shape of the Om symbol. We arrive in Gorkarna around 4/4.30AM, it's still dark and there's no one around. Collectively everyone off the bus decides to walk down to the beach, await sunrise and find a room, sounds nice, but when you're tired, not so much. Not to mention streets, beaches, pretty much everywhere is owned by the dogs at night. In most places they're just roaming around the cities, eating rubbish and whatever food westerners give them, Indians usually treat them like shit and beat them, which is probably why they're so unpredictable, you hear stories of people getting fucking bitten by them! Most of the time though, they'll just bark at you until you get off their territory, still rather unnerving though.



Anyway, I get a room at Sunset point, probably the best view on the beach 300rs a night, which seemed reasonable until the last night when I noticed fucking cockroaches crawling all over the place!

The beach in Gorkarna is so nice! there's another round the corner, Kudlee beach, I wish I'd had time to visit, but I was only there for two nights. On the second day I got a kayak with some friends, 300rs for two hours. There's two secluded beaches that are only accessible via the sea, or climbing over rocks. Half Moon beach and Paradise beach, basically places where the hippies go and stay in tents, build there own leaf shacks, cook their own food and sit playing guitar, fucking douches!. A few years ago the police came down and demolished all the buildings that were there, so I wasn't expecting to find anything. We pull the Kayaks up onto Half moon beach, and there's a couple of stone buildings, and no one about.....very strange. We're looking around and there's every sign of life, apart from life. Very creepy, it was like something from the start of a horror movie!
We quickly get off Half moon and round to Paradise, which is fucking over exaggerating the beach! I'm rowing the kayak in and a wave comes and nearly fucking capsized me! fuck sake.
There's just a few hippies sat around, I wasn't staying there long!
The beach really reminds me of what ""The Beach"" (the book) would be like.



Literally just spent the day swimming in the sea and lounging on the beach, the seas really calm, so perfect for swimming. The waves break really late, it's so trippy to watch, it looks like it just stops all of a sudden.

Now to Thrissur to meet Anu (from the Raleigh project that I volunteered with last year)!

hampi
The journey to Hampi entailed my first bus ride in India. The bus is none A/C so it's hot as fuck! The beds are pretty uncomfy and it's pretty hard to sleep because the bus is rocking everywhere, turning corners, stopping etc! Definitely need to stick to the train in future. When I first get on the bus, I find my bed, and it's like the size of a normal single, but I'm meant to be sharing it with someone, turns out to be some European chick. Her and her friend have been separated and her friend's got a full bed to herself...So of course, I do the chivalrous thing and offer to swap with her friend, so as to avoid the awkward situation of having to sleep next to a randomer, fuck that! and to get my own full bed. I assume the beds are set up in this way because Indians don't have the same discomfort with invading strangers personal space, as evidenced by their queueing.

I arrive in Hampi, I'm not really sure what to expect, the only things I really know is that it was an old kingdom and meant to be fucking class!. Turns out Hampi is actually just a small town, surrounded by the old kingdom, temples, palaces everywhere etc. There's 2000 temples in Hampi! Not a sniff of me visiting all of them!

Hampi is essentially the Rome of India, the kingdom there was very rich and powerful, they conquered most of south India in their time and had trading routes with Rome, China...etc, and they're still excavating to find more ruins. Some people I met there likened it to Ankgor Wat in Cambodia.

I find a guest house ""Funky Monkey"", really good stay! 250rs a night, fucking class food! The best Thali (Indian dish with Chapatis, two curries, rice and a pudding) I've ever had! The guy running the show, Shiva, is a really cool guy, dead sound.

The first day I wandered to the main temple, I meet an Indian man (Krishna) who works in the tourist office as a guide, he's giving me a free map (which turns out to be a photo copied piece of shit which you can't read, no wonder it's free), and explains the route I should walk from Hampi up to the Vitthala temple (The apparent main attraction in Hampi), I also organise to go with a tour group with Krishna the day after, 450rs they hire a push iron (bicycle) for you, Krishna comes with you as the guide and you go round the southern part of Vijayanagar, 3km away.

Walking away from the temple, and this is the case with every main temple in Vijayanagar, there's like a long continuous room with pillars stretching the length from one temple to the next, 750M, this is what used to be the bazaar (Indian market), on the bottom floor they used to sell gold, diamonds, precious stones...etc. At night they used to cover the gold etc with a sheet and leave it there, and no one would steal it! Imagine that today!. On the top floor they sold flowers, looking at the worn down, decrepit looking buildings it's hard to imagine people selling gold there, but this was 500 years ago!

The next thing I come to is fucking amazing! It's the Achyutharaya temple (meaning Karma-sutra temple), if you're in Hampi definitely check this out! This, for me, was the best thing I saw! I don't think many people visit because there was no one around, and I went there twice. Overgrown grass on the floor, walking around was fucking enchanting! It felt like I was walking around somewhere I wasn't supposed to be, but it also kinda had the same feeling as walking around Liverpool castle up Rivi at the same time, definitely would be a good place for a rave.

Up to the Vitthala temple, 250rs to get in? Fuck that. I use the extremely good zoom on my camera, climb up to a vantage point on top of the bazaar and get pictures of the inside.

The tour the day after was class! Met some cool people too, really good to walk around the temples and actually know what things are, and it makes it way more interesting once you know the history behind things. The tour takes you past the biggest statue of Ganesh in I think India, but maybe just the south, I can't remember. The statue is broken from when the Muslims laid siege to the kingdom, which was the eventual end of Vijayanagar, they went round and smashed loads of temples and statues etc, hence why most things are in ruins. We then go a slightly smaller statue of Ganesh, this was for the public, the other for the royal family. This statue of Ganesh is unique because it's the only one in India that shows Parvati (Ganesh's mum) around the back of him with her arms reaching round, which is why he has four arms. Then down to a statue of Shiva, which was also destroyed by the muslims, but the historians excavating Hampi attempted to fix it with plaster, they did a decent job....apart from building his legs crossed rather than one being down, they're now banned from trying to fix any statues haha. Just on a side note, on this trip I've realised Shiva is a mother fucking gansta! He's regularly depicted holding/smoking a chillum (what Indians use to smoke weed) and he's the god of destruction, so he goes about killing people. Maybe religion in the West would be more appealing if god was this cool!

It's 250rs to get into the main palace complex, where only woman used to be allowed in as it was the queens resting quarters, basically just more ruins. Although there's small building which the queen used for dancing, which has ancient A/C built into it! Some clever fuck came up with the idea that if you run pipes through the walls and then fill them with water, somehow it works like A/C, unfortunately I don't know the science behind that!. Most of southern Vijayanagar's ruins are exactly that, just foundations in the floor. BUT! the ticket for the palace complex also works at the Vitthala temple on the same day! Spot on. The Vitthala temple actually turned out to be pretty cool so I'm glad I went, there's a stone chariot in there which is like the main thing to see in Hampi, it doesn't roll, obviously.

Next day I hire a push iron (bicycle for none northerners) 50rs for the day, and head across the river to Anegondi and Virupapuragadda, 20rs at the river crossings for you and the bike, they take you across on a little boat. Anegondi isn't as the guide book describes it, it's a small village, most of the things the guide book suggests to see are fucked. The palace, which the guide book says is still intact is actually more or less burned to the ground, and the temples aren't really worth seeing. The ride from Anegondi to Hanuman's temple is beautiful, surrounded by cotton fields and banana plantations, and of course the amazing landscape of the whole area.

Thousands of years ago the whole area was under water, which is what makes the rocks all like boulders, it's so strange to see, it looks like something from Star Trek! It appears to be piles of boulders in random areas, but they're ""mountains"" (nothing is a mountain to me anymore) made from rocks, and because it's been under water, the water has shaped the rocks this way. Some of the boulders are perched so precariously on top of each other! They look like they're going to tumble down and fucking crush you at any second!.

The view from Hanuman's temple is out of the world, the landscape of the area, with the temples dotted about is amazing! Truly one of the best views I've had on the trip, and that's saying something!

Virupapuragadda is basically a small village on the other side of the river to Hampi, I come back this way so I can complete a loop, you can also stay on this side of the river, and in hindsight that would've been the better option. Upon arrival at Hampi, I assumed there wouldn't be anyone over the other side of the river, but it turns out most people are actually staying on this side, it's quieter, nicer looking, more chilled out and the added benefit that you can buy alcohol, which is illegal in Hampi as far as I'm aware...There looked to be so many cool people to meet over there too! Fuck! Definitely next time.

I spend the last day just lounging around. Now, off to Gokarna and the beach for some much needed rest...haha.

We move toward safari whose entrance is just before ticket counter, if your are coming from buss stop direction.So he took our ticket and cut it from end ,we are finally in.we cross a lawn between that we can see lots of foreigners with there kids and as always they charge more from them but later we found they also get good seats.
We take our seats in bus(seats are based on first come priority). you don’t need to rush because all seats are good and you are going to get your share of view.
Its around 10:15 am. Initially you will feel you are in some kind of village. but when you enter into the 1st gate you will find it is quite real damn real (its gates is like gate in Jurassic park movie).there are 2 doors.1st door open ,we enter after it get
IMG_20140907_104804614
closed than 2nd door will open and you enter in the main area(good amount of security).

Its around 10:15 am.

Bear Safari
We are on the last seat, we are concern about the view the something happens.We got the glimpse of a black bear .every one is rushed to see him(him or her I don’t know my gender knowledge is limited only to cows & dogs).Then we see a whole big bear. I am using whole because it is really big. He is lying on the ground(like a dead) and my friend commented he is in love and every body laughed .but again we got some bears lying continuously in the same position.(just in 10 meter region) there is no movement in them. we start to think they are models and real bears are
DSC_0474
still going to come and just 40 second after we see group of bears moving identical to each other. we then again start to think they are costumes and some one is inside that acting like a bear and we expresses ourselves loud. full buss start to laugh including buss driver and it is just a matter of moments we can see whole area full of bears they are very close, big, fantastic, real beautiful.

Some bears are concern about our presence some are veteran they don’t care. As one bear is start moving in front of our buss ,two of them start moving we the buss. people start clicking photos. We are all exited .After some time moving along the bear buss make a way and we just cross the exit gate of bear safari.

Lion Safari:
We entered into the zone by same Jurassic park like gate. Just in 2 minutes we find our self in between group of Lions. you can feel the presence of king. They are big. some of them are with there lioness (I don’t know about that lioness to which lion she belongs).
Here we can easily see the difference(lioness with
DSC_0489
LION king
hairs).they don’t care about our presence they are setting like kings and give expressions like –I don’t care if you are human or anyone I know you can’t do anything, its like two lions are talking with each other.
Lion1- Look humans.
Lion2-Ignore them ,they are regular.
And we are feeling that we are not here to see them. Actually it’s a human safari for Lions.
Look look a lion is very near to my window. I feel like I can touch him. but it is not possible and even it needs guts to do that.1st time I am that close it is intimidating ,exciting Wow!. At that time I am just there, not thinking about anything, just constantly starring at him only. After these we enter into the tiger safari

Tiger safari:

Same type of gate, All in our bus is constantly starring a tiger near our bus .you can easily absorb the alertness in his walk. He is not looking you but he is looking you, he is so present ,so deadly. His beauty is enhance more when you absorb his shades of his body
. All intimidating stories about sunder ban(West Bengal) ,all stories about
DSC_0494
Lioness
tiger, how they hunt (discovery channel).how much they show patient, all these things is moving inside my mind. Specialty about these park is that they have both normal and white tigers.
There are only 1700-1800 total tiger in India now. They are super animal, they climb, swim, jump and by these experience I get my answer why they are national animal.
After Watching tigers glory. we went out outside safari zone and our next destination is butterfly park.

Butterfly park:
After 50 minutes of Safari we head toward butterfly park. The most latest addition in beauty of bunnergutta national park. It is quite beautiful it is started in 2005.A beautiful statue of butterfly is made outside the park and you get surprise when you go inside. Area is full of butterflies. Some butterfly can come and seat on you
They are just like stars every where .Structure is also beautiful(dome shape).As you move inside ,you can absorb that pound and other stuff made to enhance the beauty. We spend half an hour and then we move inside information center. There you will get all information about the types of butterfly present there and also you get to know how
IMG_20140907_105919871
butterfly grows. It is good, you can go with your kids.

ZOO:
After that we went for Zoo. Zoo is large in area. But we can find lots of varieties of species, specially if you are interested in Snakes and tortoise. Some snakes are quite big and some turtles are very small. We also find ostrich is a real surprise.
Things to Remember
1. Try to reach early.
2. It is good if you take food with you, Don’t expect much in terms of food
3. Check your watch before going for boating because they promise more and give you less

Thing I absorb in animals
TIGER-Alertness
LION-fearlessness, confidence.

Best of luck and Enjoy.

Temple at Chamundi hills
Mysore is a mesmerising ancient city of palaces in South India. I started off the journey on 12Th of Nov at around 8 in the night by bus along with a bunch of energetic and enthusiastic chumps. On Thursday morning, we checked in at Ashirwadh Hotel and straight away went to explore the Zoological Garden which was interestingly set up in around 8-10 acres within an exquisite bandstand. The zoo authorities do not allow one to carry plastics and food items as part of their new project scheme ,which means that , we had a tiring time covering the entire zoo being thirsty.But the zoo invited us to a fascinating planet altogether.This planet not only contained varied varieties of animals, but also beautiful walk throughs surrounded by natural vegetation, wide range of flora and fauna, and many rare species .Devika and I , even though two nature buffs , we found it a mammoth task to reach the exit point. We sauntered quiet too fast while the rest from my gang was indulged in clicking the wildlife. We then set out to visit the magnificent and the most opulent Mysore palace known as Amba Vilas Palace. The beauty of palace is
Tippu's Jamia masjid
beyond my words can possibly encompass. It's corridors, antiques made of gold, silver ,and ivory, the majestic domes , chandeliers, the whole architectural elements were all very much awe- inspiring. One can never take their eyes off from it's colourful and intricate paintings the covers both the walls and ceilings of the palace with its rich detail about the myths, tales of war and love with its essence of Hindu-Islam Rajput fusion . We girls got highly jealous of the wodeyar rulers for their lavishness and luxury, but the sad part was that we were not allowed cameras inside the palace so as to capture the royal moments. After a small siesta, we wriggled our way up to the Chamundi Hills.This place apart from being the area of the oldest temple , it the prime view point where one can see the whole of Mysore City. The night view , when the entire city is illuminated is something never to be missed. We girls got on top of a narrow parapet beside the road to get hypnotised in the bright and mind blogging scene in the panorama. Some of the us were too crazy to stand over the narrow parapet and to click the risky and dangerous selfies so as to outdo others in Facebook. After a chilly frozen venturing to the hilltop gulping down pani puris and hot teas, we returned and crashed onto our beds as quickly so as to wake up for yet another adventurous royal visits to Tippu palace and monastery. The Tippu Sulthan's Summer palace is comparatively less luxurious, situated within large area and is simple with its wooden architecture and faded paintings in its inside which is worth visiting. We then travelled another couple of hours to Coorg to experience the exciting White water Rafting . We jumped into to the rafts with few experts for a secured adventure paddling. The most memorable part of the rafting was whirling the raft and jumping into the river out of sheer excitement. After getting fully soaked we decided to go for musical night party amidst coconut farm and trees to recharge our batteries. We bunch of girls were banging our heads and tapping our foot with the rhythm of disco lights and DJ music giving a final touch to our adventurous trip.

Gate of India, Mumbai
Hi all



Well we got togged up and enjoyed a very nice drink in the rather plush Harbour Bar at the lavishly beautiful Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai. If only we'd checked Booking.com earlier as much to our surprise the room rate was pretty reasonable so we could have treated ourselves to a night's stay. Hey ho we will do next time as we certainly intend to visit India again as we're loving it so much.



We spent 3 full and rather crazy days in Mumbai over the Diwali Festival. It was extremely busy, wonderfully colourful as many of the properties were decorated in fairy lights and so very noisy with fireworks being let off all the time. The sheer volume of people was a little overwhelming at times - the population of Mumbai is 18.4 million and there were thousands of visitors in town for the festival.



We dd manage to see the following attractions though:-

- Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai's biggest and best museum which opened in 1923 and displays a great mix of exhibits from all over India.

- The Gateway of India, a huge
Taj Mahal Palace Hotel
As seen on TV. Our place was one road back, but a world away!
basalt arch facing out to Mumbai Harbour. It was actually built to commemorate the 1911 royal visit of King George V but was not completed until 1924. Nowadays it's a favourite gathering spot for locals and a top spot for people watching.

- St Thomas' Cathedral, a charming building begun in 1672 and finished in 1718. It's the oldest English building in Mumbai - a marriage of Byzantine and colonial-era architecture.

- The High Court, an elegant 1848 neo-Gothic building the design of which was inspired by a German castle. Sadly for us it was closed over the Diwali Festival as we'd have loved to have seen inside too.

- Victoria Terminus, Mumbai's most extravagant Gothic building (added to Unesco World Heritage list in 2004) and the beating heart of its railway network. It was completed in 1887 and today is Asia's busiest train station.

- Elephana Island, another Unesco Heritage site and an hour's boat ride away from Mumbai Harbour, home to a labyrinth of cave-temples carved into the island's basalt rock that contain some of India's most impressive temple carving. The temples are thought to date from AD 450 to AD 750. The island

was originally known as Gharapuri (Place of Caves) but the Portuguese called it Elephanta because of a large stone elephant near the shore.





We flew from Mumbai to Goa on 26 October - just a short 1 hr 5 min flight away but felt like we'd landed on a paradise island! Wow what a fab part of India. Beautiful scenery, so lush and green, fabulous golden sandy beaches and the warm Arabian sea - a real tonic for the soul. We chose to stay way down South in Palolem and very pleased we did as it was a lovely quiet resort with a wonderful bay. We enjoyed 3 days of rest & relaxation there. It was very hard to leave but our time in India is running out fast.





From Goa we flew to Bangalore (short 1hr 10min trip) and then took a cab onto Mysore which we'd expected to take 4 hours but had omitted to take into account the rush hour in Bangalore so ended up being nearly 6 hours. We'd only planned to stay in Mysore for a night or 2 but ended up staying there 4
Victoria Terminus, Mumbai
Not bad for a train station
nights as we liked it so much. It's said that if you haven't been to Mysore then you just haven't seen South India. It's one of the most flamboyant places in India and is known for its glittering royal heritage, bustling markets, magnificent monuments, cosmopolitan culture and friendly people. Whilst here we visited:-

- Mysore Palace, a jaw-droppingly stunning richly decorated palace. It was the former seat of the Wodeyar Maharajas. The old palace was gutted by fire in 1897, the one you can see now was completed in 1912 by English architect Henry Irwin. Highlights for us were the Private and Public Durbar Halls', the Marriage Pavilion (a lavish hall used for royal weddings) and the numerous fabulous oil paintings. It's a feast for the eyes as everywhere you look you see the most ornately carved teak and rosewood doors and ceilings and amazing stained and painted glass ceilings. Unfortunately cameras are not allowed inside. Luckily for us we also got to see the palace lit up which happens for one hour every Sunday and on public holidays.

- Mysore Zoo, which was brilliant and we're sure has much higher standards then we suspect most zoos do
Victoria Terminus, Mumbai
Looks more like cathedral
in India. It's set in pretty gardens that date from 1892 and highlights included the big cats (especially the white tigers), rhinos, Indian & African elephants and giraffes.

- Chamund Hill, on its summit of 1,062m stand the Sri Chamundeswari Temple which is dominated by a towering 40m high entrance gateway. We queued with thousands of locals to get into the temple to be blessed. There are also fabulous views up here over the city.

- Jayachamar Art Gallery which is housed in the Jaganmohan Palace that was built in 1861 as the royal auditorium. The gallery contains a collection of kitsch objects and royal memorabilia of the Mysore Royal family.

- Rail Museum, open-air with main exhibit being the Mysore Maharani's saloon (a wood-panelled beauty dating from 1899). There are 6 steam engines you can climb aboard and pretend to be the driver - great for kids of all ages. Worryingly we noticed one of the engines was 2 years younger than us!

- St Philomena's Cathedral built between 1933 and 1941 in neo-Gothic style with beautiful stained glass windows.

While we were in Mysore there were some parades going on which we later
Elephanta Island
Big rock carvings hey!
discovered were to celebrate its name changing to Mysuru.



We're now making our way down to Kerala where we plan to spend our last week in India.



Happy thoughts from India.

Lots of love, Trev & Verity xx

Nagarhole national park
Beware of those bushes, who knows what comes out of it?
By Vishnu.

Have you ever Coorghed? If you haven’t, do it now. It doesn’t matter whom you go with- its a place of Liveliness, happiness and craziness. Very recently, I (Vishnu) traveled to Coorgh with six of my besties in Innova. Due to the long weekend (October 2nd to October 6th, 2014), Coorgh would obviously be crowded, but my experience was amazing nonetheless. It all started on October 2nd. I started with six of my friends from Bangalore (they deserve to be named here- Harsha, Varma, Roopesh, Chaitanya, Anil and Muni.)

Our trip started at around 11 in the morning after a small McDonald’s brunch on the way to Mysore. We reached Mysore at around 3'o clock (we underestimated the traffic, because of the long weekend.) We also had lunch at Parklane hotel in Mysore; they served good biryani, despite a late serving time.



We intended to reach our stay point (near Kutta) by nightfall, which was 100km from Mysore. In the route map we saw that we have to pass through the Nagarhole National Park (a stretch of deep forest and animal sanctuary for 52 km), which we later found out that the forest department
Deer Sightings
Thank god, their prey isn't here!
won’t allow any vehicles into the forest after 6pm. We had to race to reach the gates of the Nagarhole forest and rather cinematically we were there by 5:58 pm. After a little convincing, we entered the forest. It was already getting dark, and our Innova seemed to be the only vehicle in the forest. We were warned by the officials. ""Don’t get out of the car, don't sound horns and don't project lights etc."" Apparently, elephants might get mad and we could die in the stampede. Where is fun if we don't defy authorities; we stepped out of the car, took more than a few pics.





There were some alarming animal calls as the night progressed, and we followed the sounds, only to find large masses of deer, Bison and baboons. Dusk broke down into deep darkness and chilling breezes; the distant sounds of birds, animals and crickets dominated our engine sound. That was when we saw a loner elephant at the side of the road, which thrilled us (fear might be a better word ;-)) There was no signal in our phone, no sight of man and no light nearby. It was something
Early morning View
Paradise, Heaven, Eden, Nirvana..you name it!
that should be experienced. We reached the finish point of the Nagarhole National park at around 8.30 pm, and like we expected, the gate was locked. We feared we might be stuck there in the forest until the next morning. Fortunately, we found the guard sometime later. Despite of the whining and bribery, he unlocked the gate and we reached Kutta in no time. From there we came to our stay point, Ramcad Guest house. Temperatures dropped to 17'c, and a silhouette of humongous hill loomed over our guest house. It was very dark, and we couldn’t see where we are. We didn’t get a signal here either, except for limited airtel coverage. We settled down and had homemade Non Veg dinner,just outside the cottage in a wooden shelter (like a kiosk) amidst a lavish garden. Coorgh is famous for Pork, and our cook made it deliciously. And after a card game, we rested for the night.

It was only in the morning, we fathomed the real meaning of beauty in the nature. Thick Fog enveloped the guest house, and the greenery was exceedingly beautiful. The huge hill casting its shadow over us might have inspired the CGI in
White Water Rafting.
""Jingalalla Jingalalla..Oooh aah, Oooh aah."". Barpole Theme song!
Disney films. ""You would forget all the troubles, and peace will be at your feet"", is an understatement here. Our guest house is set up amidst a lush garden of flowering plants and huge trees, stationed on a small hill, from which whole of the area was visible. Waking up at 6 in the morning has its own rewards, as we took an early morning walk into the surroundings and it definitely was a Walk To Remember. French toast, Dosas and Idlis comprised our breakfast.









We booked us for Rafting at the nearby Barpole River at 11 Am. The river was 10km from our stay point and located in Tata Tea estates. Once we got there, a Guide ushered us to the rafting point in his jeep, where we geared up for the adventure. Life jackets, Helmets and Oars to steer our raft were given to us, along with rowing commands and safety briefing. We garnered our efforts and strength to row the raft in the white water. (Caution: You will become wet, so gear up accordingly)



Water levels that time were not high, but okay. We rafted
Tata Tea Estates!
You don't like tea? See the pic, and tell me again!
through four frothy white rapids called as- Mickey Mouse, Wicked Witch, Band of bushes and the Big Bang. We loved the wicked witch rapid, for the fall was deeper than others. I don’t know about other packages, but our 'Acepaddlers' rafting gave us a pretty good surprise. The guide stopped us at midpoint in the river, and told us to jump. He didn’t even ask us, he commanded us. We had our life jackets on and so we didn't even blink twice to jump into the water. An Amazing unforgettable swim that was. That Rafting proved worthy of the time and money we spent.











Then we spent some time taking pics at a tea plantation, miles and miles of foliage stretched over the hilly areas, all along the road back to Irupu falls. Irupu falls was heavily crowded, with couples and families massed upon. We hiked up 2km inwards to the falls, and it had a good flow. We decided to bathe (we were already wet from rafting, so no issues there.) in it. The water almost gave us a vagal shock due to its numbing coldness, and still
Irupu falls, level 3 ??
Milky white color, Numbing Cold, Shooting droplets..
we dived into water. One of my friends induced an allergic reaction at the falls (No reason to worry though, it mitigated on its own sometime later.) and so we left the falls and reached the guest house by nightfall.



We could have a bon fire, but we actually forgot the very idea of it. We bought snacks and drinks from the nearby Kutta; we hollowed through the night playing Anthyakshari, Dumb Charades and French Bid under the open shelter, through which cold breeze battled with hot food, giving us a rich experience of a Chilly Night. That was the last night at Ramcad Guest house, so we made a pact to come back to this same place again within 6 years. (This is a bachelor trip, mind you! We don’t know where we would be in the next 6 years.)

The next day we planned to go to Madikeri (70kms from kutta), to pick up another late joining friend. We woke up early at 5, and rode up the hilly areas of Coorgh to reach Madikeri. It was a sight to the sleepy eyes, as fog made us to focus on the road; it was
Enroute to Madikeri @5 AM.
""Fog, as thick as wool""...See, i don't exaggerate!
as thick as wool, but also it was a spectacle to our ‘summer-eyes’ (In Nellore, Fog is a luxury we can’t afford). We picked our friend, booked us a room at VanVihar homestay, just outside Madikeri. We checked in and refreshed, and started off to Mallalli Falls (under the footsteps of Pushapagiri hills), 60km from Madikeri. ‘It was called as newzealand of south’ my friend quoted.













It was 1’o Clock as we reached Mallalli Falls. We didn’t know we had to walk 3km to see the falls (view point), and trek down further 2km from the view point to get wet! The narrow and rugged pathway to the view point allow some vehicles (small cars and jeeps) to travel through; there are also paid jeep services to get you to the view point, but if you want to get wet, you have to climb down the hill.









The view of the falls exceeded our imagination; Kumardhara River gushing through the valley and falling into the 200 feet deep gorge, the sights of which were surrounded by cloud topped
Mallalli falls (Newzealand!!?)
Imagine Seeing this, after a painful 3km walk in the sun. Beauty has a new meaning= Relief!
green hills. Piqued by its beauty, we couldn’t help ourselves but decided to get wet. One has to be cautious in the monsoons about the leeches, poisonous insects and snakes that inhabited the place. The flow of the river nearly threw us off the course while swimming, but we managed to have fun; we thought we deserved it for all the walking we did. It was almost dark, as we walked back to the parking spot. No security was provided there by the government, but it was advised to come back around 6, due to dangers of the forest and drunken men. We were tired, and with another homemade chicken and fish buffet, we ended the night, sleeping early. We earned that right too, coz we didn’t have enough sleep last night and the physical demand was too high for us at Mallalli falls.









Slept early and woke late, got ready and waved bye to the Van Vihar homestay. On the way to Nisargadhama (27km from Madikeri), we shopped at Coorgh spices for tea, coffee and other local made goods. Nisarghadhama, an island formed by Cauvery River, was a park area
Swimmers (who don't know swimming ;-P)
You can see the flow and its rage..Look out for the slippery stones too (especially you /\!)
with lush bamboo groves, deer sanctuary and elephant riding spot. We didn’t spend much time here, and it was crowded too. The hanging rope bridge, tree houses, orchidarium, and boating were some of the other things we saw inside.













From there, we arrived at Tibetan monastery in Bylakuppe, 6kms from Kushalnagar. The golden temple was an astounding architecture, and the first thing we would see on entering. We passed through Tibetan monk settlements and small shrines, which portrayed rich Tibetan culture. Upon entering the ornate golden temple, you will be amazed at the sudden vision of three large golden statues- Buddha at the center and two gurus on either side. There was history painted on the walls of the temple, which would enlighten us about the importance of those magnanimous statues.





Outside, there was also a beautiful garden and many shrines where monks meditate, a Tibetan restaurant (We wanted to eat, but time wasn’t our friend that day) and a flea market. We bought laughing Buddha key chains as souvenirs from the market, but then we learnt that if you give that
Budhha statues.
About 30 feet long..Elegance at its best...It must have cost them a fortune to make them in gold..
keychain to somebody you love, they will live a prosperous and happy life. So we gifted them to ourselves in a circle, so that everyone would get one from the other friend.











We journeyed back to Mysore at 3pm, saw Mysore palace before it was lit. From there, again underestimating traffic, we reached Bangalore at 11pm in the night, and had dinner at Meghana restaurant (Koramangala), one of the best biryanis in the city. The day ended with two of our friends leaving to Tirupathi by bus. On fifth day, the rest of us stayed in Bangalore to see a movie and to eat at Truffles and KFC. By the night, we were in our homes, reminiscing this awesome five day trip; thoughts of which would haunt us forever into the beauty of friendship. I know that I would remember all the jokes, all the counter-jokes and all the silly fights that encountered in this trip. Every moment of it would turn nostalgic as time passes by, and I am grateful for my friends for making me a part of it.





Anyway, I hope
Laughing Buddhha Keychain.
Souvenir! I am not sure how long it stays as a souvenir though.
this blog explains you of everything you need to make this trip. Coorgh is best to travel in monsoons, but in our five day trip, we didn’t have any rain. Researching before planning helps too. You will find every place, every cottage and everything else in Google (duh!) But don’t forget one thing- It’s a trip into the nature, so don’t let your modern life with all your gadgets, interfere with your trip. And hey, Bon Voyage!

March 2008. Sandhya, my batchmate from college paid the Bangalore gang a visit. The plan was to go for a road trip around Bangalore. She really wanted to go to Coorg, but since I was just back from Coorg I insisted we go somewhere else. I did feel bad, later on, about making her change her plans because of me. So the four of us and Rahul (Tipu) decided to head out for Gokarna. But we misplanned the trip and started only late in the evening. We werent able to appreciate the beautiful route to the beach town. But that was made up by the interesting conversations we had on our way.

We passed through curvy steep western ghats with dense forests. It would have been great if the journey had been in daytime. We reached Gokarna early in the morning.

The beach was just optimally crowded. There were several beaches separated by small hills. We could trek over the hills and go from one beach to the other. On the last beach in the row we hired a boat which took us to the beaches not easily accessible. We managed to spot some dolphins too in the ocean.
1206301029
The coast line at Gokarna was uniquely beautiful. We could see big mountains directly merging into the ocean. The beaches were surrounded by mountains on three sides and had ocean on the fourth. We ate and drank at a shack and sometime around 4 headed back for Bangalore.

Once again we ended up traveling in the dark and missed the beautiful part of the journey. It was raining heavily on the way back and our driver was drowsy too. We were happy to be back safe in Bangalore the next morning.

Entering Mysore
Januaray 2007. This was my first trip after moving to Bangalore. Varun and Pawan, my colleagues had just bought their bikes and had been looking to go on a long pleasure ride. So on one fine Friday night we along with Imon decided to set out for Coorg the next morning. We memorized the route to Coorg via Mysore through google maps. Smartphones with 3G connections were not quite there then.

Hitting the highway next morning was quite a good feeling. It was a trip where I was kind of leading the pack of four boys on bikes and thus got a feeling of having finally entered adulthood from the protected years of college life.

We headed south-west of Bangalore on Mysore Road which happened to be one of the best highways at that time. We could easily touch 100+kmph on that road at least upto Mysore. It was a bright and pleasant day. The landscape on both sides of the road comprised endless uniform green fields with stony hills and coconut trees as the only aberrations. The stony hills of Karnataka are quite unique. They are like a spilled stack of large hard rocks, the mud covering them
1202322804
En-route to Madikeri
having been washed off over the ages.

Right before entering Mysore, we took a right turn towards Coorg. On the way to Coorg were Khushalnagar Buddhist monastery, but we kept that for our return trip. Somewhere on our way, I and Varun managed to get far ahead of Pawan and Imon and hence decided to take a detour onto a road which looked like going nowhere. We ended up on a muddy road which lead us to a lake which was completely inconspicuous from the highway because of the bamboo jungle all around it. That place was like a whole different world. No human settlement around. Vast stretch of untouched nature. A lake followed by a hillock and a lot of greenery. For a while we were feeling like Vasco-da-gama.

It was time to get back to the highway after spending few minutes there. Coorg is a hill station and we were expecting steep climb somewhere, but that does not quite come untill the very end. The road does start sloping upwards but hardly becomes steep. It passes through some really unique villages of Karnataka giving a view into a world so contrasting with what we have in
1202322862
Stone art near the lake we discovered
Bangalore. The life is conspicuously slower there making us question the need of daily grind back in Bangalore.

Closer to our destination we get into the region of large trees which looked much different from the ones which we are used to seeing. Or probably they looked unique because we noticed them properly after long. Our road took us through famous Coorg coffee plantations too.

Just before sunset we were at Madikeri, a hill station town in Coorg. Managed to find a cheap room for four of us. Had dinner at this antique looking restaurant named 'the west end' (if I remember right).

We woke up early the next morning to see sun rise at 'Raja seat'. We hired at auto rickshaw driver who became our tour guide as well and took as around some temples and important places of the Madikeri town. Abbey falls was our next stop. That probably was my first time at a waterfall. we went in the water near the falls though was not possible to get directly below the falls.

After breakfast, we hit the road back to Bangalore. On our way back we visited the majestic Harangi Dam which
1202322145
Raja Seat
was a slight detour from the main highway. We took another detour to Khushalnagar Buddhist monastery. The road to monastery had a Tibetan settlement which was quite a surprise for us. It was like a mini Tibet far too south in India. The monastery was a beautiful place. Peaceful, artistically made and tranquil. We got a chance to see a session of prayer from the Buddhist monks.

By the time we reached Mysore, it began to get dark. We still had 150kms to cover to reach Bangalore. We had to slow down because of dark. We took a stop over at a CCD on Mysore highway (70kms from Bangalore). CCD was still a charm back in those days and specially at unique place like that.

We hit Bangalore somewhere around 9:30 and congratulated ourselves on successfully completing a great road trip!

Kingfisher 1
The day dawns at Bhainsrorgarh. We go down with one of the boys to the Chambal to take an early morning boat ride to go bird spotting. The gnarled boatman and his sidekick row us down the seemingly still river to a small island inhabited by bats and vultures, and various small birdies. Around the island we see numerous herons, cranes and kingfishers. Monkeys frolic on the bank and stop to watch us with curiosity. The early morning light slants through the trees and a light mist rises off the water.

We return to the hotel and breakfast on the roof. We then decide just to enjoy the fort and spend an idle day reading and doing very little.



Wednesday we set off early to Delwara. The road is rough and potholed until we meet the main highway to Mumbai (some 550 miles away) and then we speed along. The country is arid and flat, with stumpy trees until we approach Udaipur where the Aravalli hills rise up. We turn off before Udaipur and head further into the hills. The Devi Garh fort is perched in a defensive position guarding one of the three passes south to
Bhainsrorgarh Fort from the river
Udaipur. It was built in the 18th century and converted into a heritage hotel about fifteen years ago. It claims to mix minimalist chic with Rajput heritage, or some such hyperbole. We get showered with rose petals from the gateway on arrival, which is amusing but somehow a bit false after the genuine Rajput hospitality we have enjoyed so far. It is now extremely hot and we decide to defer a walk into the village to see the Jain temples until sunset. However, as the sun approaches the horizon, the sky turns a pink orange shade, the clouds come down, and the winds of hell start lashing the hotel. This is bizarre......

Turkey
Likes to hang out outside the studio and serenade us with gobbles.
Currently I am sitting at the airport waiting for a flight to Goa... I got here extremely early so I thought it was time for an update.

There hasn't been much adventuring for me over the past few weeks so I thought I might make a list of things I have learned that may be of use to someone wanting to travel to Bangalore. Please understand I must only say Bangalore because people from other places tell me they are totally different to here and different things apply but I guess some general things will be consistent.

So must begin by saying that one month is as long as it takes to feel adjusted. I have found myself a routine and some coping mechanisms for spending a lot of time on my own - a healthy addiction to Sons of Anarchy and Paulo Coelho novels. I feel more confident being out in my own area in the evenings now, I know the streets and some shops where I have become a regular customer give me a sense of safety. Two of my students have been educating me about the local food and introduced to some people who work at
Dosa
Onion Rava Masala Dosa, Plus various chutneys and Subzi
the local restaurants, which was a huge help.

Food in south India consists mainly of rice. You can get it in various forms - standard steamed rice, dosa, a flat, semi fried pancake, iddly, a round steamed rice cake and vada, a fried doughnut, all of which come in various forms and accompany what is called Subzi or vegetable curry, chutney, usually coconut, sometimes Mint, mango or tomato, Sambar, a spicy lentil based stew, very thin and Rasam, a soup like concoction. You can get all of these things at most places, each place having their own version. Then there is Biriyani, which consists of rice, chicken or mutton meat or vegetables. There are different types of Biriyani, depending on the spices used. So far I have tryed Donne Biriyani, served in a bowl made out of dried Banana leaf which comes with chicken, half a boiled egg, chopped onion, cucumber and gravy and Ambur Biriyani, differnt spices are used but again served with chicken and gravy - there was salad at the table in the food house but I was not game enough to try it, as caution must be taken when eating fresh vegetables in restaurants that
Breakfast
Iddly, Vada and various other delights
are not connected to 5 star hotels. Then there are the breads, Chapati, a particular kind of wheat based flat bread and Parotta, a layered wheat flat bread. I crave Parottas, parotta and subzi, parotta and chicken, parotta and mutton, it's become my staple, a fine and filling alternative to rice I think everyone should try. Chapattis are simple and delicious but the Parotta... I have tried lots of different chicken curries, names of which I can never remember, I'd need to have a note book with me constantly to record them, but this would be to hard with my fingers covered in food as I become more accustomed to eating everything by hand without cutlery. The amount of times I miss hear what is being said for the accent is nearly 100% and vice versa, so it can hard to order in places with no menu, but try your best, keep repeating yourself and they'll bring you something yummy usually so not to worry. Chicken is the most common and healthiest meat to get (or so I'm told) in Bangalore, so there has been many chicken meals, but I finally found a place I can get fresh/frozen meats from
Mule and Carriage
Common on the streets in Wilson Garden - My suburb
(Nature's basket, expensive supermarket for local standards but a must for western comfort food) so I finally made a delicious pork and fennel pasta topped with Granda Padano and plan to cook goat soon, this meal finally made me feel settled.

It's Ramzan (or Ramadan) right now, and a very old friend of mine who owns a hotel in Bangalore, took me, along with his gorgeous wife and brother-in-law, to a suburb called Frazier Town to try the special street food stalls, only available during Ramzan. It was so delicious and the stalls stretched for miles with most major hotels and food places bringing out their finest halal street food. Chicken on a stick, beef kebab, Biriyani and I tried Haleem, a beef/wheat dish which I can best describe as a mashed up beef pie, but that makes it sound bad when it's actually delicious. It's becoming fun to try food now the stomach has adjusted, but a note of caution must be made, only eat at recommended places or 5 star hotels, even locals get food poisoning. It's a shame really that the hygiene is not better, but with so many people, I imagine it must be hard
8th Cross road and it's various non human inhabitants
Sad truth to the life of the cow in the city - For some reason they love hanging out in Wilson Garden
to police this with health inspectors.

I have been so amazed that 2 of my students are in full fast for Ramzan and continue to take class almost as normal - sometimes they simply must sleep, but thats some seriously committed faith to be able to endure such a rigorous schedule and not even take a sip of water, mind blowing! Spirituality and faith are so very strong here, traditions have really been upheld and I find that acceptance of history and culture very inspiring.

Getting around is becoming easier. When I first got here I could never imagine how anyone could navigate themselves, the road system is very confusing, but I am pleased to say I can find my way to some places without the help of google maps and know if someone is taking me for a ride when I get in the rickshaw. Something all people must know is the rickshaw and taxi guys see foreigners as an easy pass to getting free stuff. I was casually walking down Brigade road, a main branded shopping street in Bangalore when a cabbie approached me, explaining that if I went with him to some places he would
Welcome to Attakkalari Centre for Movement Arts
get a free t-shirt for his children, I went along because he had been honest. I upset him as I failed to stay in the stores for longer than 5 minutes because I was like, seriously, I will never buy a sari, where will I wear one? And, no I can not buy wooden artefacts that will be taken off me by customs, so this is a waste of time. All of the emporiums stock the same goods and if your good at bargaining, you will not be charged a fortune, but the store clerks and Rickshaw men expect you to have no idea, so don't be alarmed, play their game, I did and got to see around an area of Bangalore and quality handcrafts for free. Also never go in a rickshaw without the metre, they will try and double your fare and if they don't want to go to the area you want on your terms they can be very rude, just ignore them and find someone who will - a thick skin is required.

The best treat I got in the last two weeks, apart from a full Sunday of cleansing rain, was a double dose of full body Ayurvedic massage and steam boxing. I suggest you get someone to recommend you a place, because there are good massage places and ones that give you a pretend treatment for the money because you are a foreigner. There are many different types of Ayurvedic treatments, that treat all ranges of body and mind issues. I went in specifically to unwind my muscles from work and to de-stress so I can sleep better. Women massage women and men massage men, and ladies if you are not comfortable with someone you don't know touching your breasts I do not recommend this. I was happy that when they say full body they meant it! You have to wear this paper g-string and lay on a wooden table that has a slight upward curve in it. You get covered in medicated oil and I mean coated, completely, my body was sliding on the table at some points due to the amount of oil used. They're movements are rhythmic, repeated and increase in pressure. On first treatment expect them to take it easy on you, this is a precaution due to foreign bodies not being used to the herbs and oils used, but you can tell them to be firmer. After the massage I was placed in a steam box. This was pretty funny because it is not a sauna room, it is literally a box with a hole in it to keep your head out. I was happy about this because I hate saunas because I get to hot and light headed. The masseuse said the head must remain out of the heat to avoid the giddiness. After the massage you are recommended to rest, I got the best sleep I've had the entire time I've been in India that night and after the second massage, it was like all of my sadness and stress had been wiped away. I think that from now on when I travel, no matter where I am I will get a massage in the first week, just to release the tension and anxiety that can be associated with travelling.

Lastly I will mention a bit about how the dancing has been going. I have started teaching the Company as well as the training course, so all of my time on the weekdays is taken up with sharing my knowledge with these wonderful people. I had a really magical moment this past week, when I realised how beautiful it was to watch someone embodying my movement and how powerful this is to witness. I do not claim originality to any class exercise I create, It follows the structures and conventions I have learnt, but is my interpretation of them manifesting into sequences of movements. The feedback gained from watching different bodies grapple with my material helps me see my habits and the places I skip because they are difficult for me, forcing me to change my approach and expand my practice. I have also been surprised every day with how much I have retained and learnt, with the added challenge of answering questions of what the exercises are for, why the class is structured in such a way and so forth. I have started creating a piece for the Diploma students graduation, that was described to me as a jigsaw puzzle, with unexpected relationships and serious of random, although somehow related events. Everyone getting a moment to shine and with 26 students, I feel this is very important. I get woken up at night with steps, counts, ideas flooding my consciousness, I love it. This experience has really allowed me the time I've needed to explore myself as a teacher and an artist, plus learning a bit about business along the way.



So to sum up:

1. Only eat at recommended places or 5 star hotels.

2. Be ready to bargain. Start by buying things at government approved stores until you get used to the prices, this includes local supermarkets for your fresh fruits and veg.

3. Never travel in a cab or rickshaw without the metre.

4. Be patient, you will adjust.

5. Get a massage and find ways to relax.

6. Dance with others, share and create.

Buffalo/Cow feeding House
So let me start today by mentioning that as I left the house I saw 3 beautifully dressed transexuals walking down my street, they gave me the warmest greeting I've had so far out on the road, otherwise people just stare and like in every city, very few smile. To add to my already camp morning I then see the police men riding around on their Leopard print motorbikes, I remember a girl posting something explaining that they are Government regulation for a section of the police force called 'The Cheetahs,' Vey amusing! I wanted to keep these posts quite frequent but I came down with fever (yes I'm doing real well on the health front, I've heard it's not uncommon for foreigners to take at least one month to get adjusted so almost there!) so I couldn't concentrate on anything in the last few days, but I must say to all the dance teachers out there who come in and teach when they are sick, you guys are the toughest of all. I now know how hard it is now and I have the upmost respect, it's about 100% harder than actually taking the class when your sick because of
The man with Coconut stick
I forgot to mention the loongies.... Male skirts, very stylish, extreme comfort worn throughout the places I visited.
the energy you must give to your students, constantly assessing their needs for that day and demonstrating exercises fifty million times. But enough about that.

Last week teaching was so, so much fun, I started introducing Improvisation tools to the students to get some idea of what kind of piece I'm going to create with 28 of them on a teeny tiny stage (yes, no relying on amazing spacial patterns, there's no room for that). I felt that students really opened up and we got to have a few great laughs. They stepped outside of their comfort zones and inspired me, they do that everyday anyway but more so in the last week of improvising. I became a total dance nerd during the week, just going home and cooking for myself, really getting in to a groove, researching bits and bobs, structuring ideas for my work, so by the end of the week I was looking forward to an adventure.

Friday evening at some of the girls took me to a pretty cool cafe near work, I would never have found it if they didn't show me as you wouldn't notice such a nice placed tucked down a
Getting Coconts
short ally, away from this chaotic, dirty main road but it was there. (Oh by the way monsoon has started and just now as I am typing my power went out for the second time this week in the evening, power shortages happen here quite a bit.) The waiter spilled some coffee, 2 girls got drenched, they were happy it didn't happen to me or they would have felt bad it seems, I felt bad for the girls but accidents happen, especially with those stupid glass trays, always despised using them! Next on the agenda was a scooter ride and I know I said last week how scared I was, this time around I actually didn't mind, to the point where I wished I could drive it. Safer if that does not happen though I'm sure as I still struggle walking across the road sometimes. I was navigator, that was fine, we reached our destination early (in India this is a big thing) and sat to watch a rather unfortunate dance show, details of which I will spare you, I'll just say it was the equivalent to a bad midday movie. Then on to more scooter time and a lovely
Opening the Coconut
dinner at one of my student's mum's restaurant, chinese/thai food.... Delicious! Then back home for a chat that lasted until around 4pm! Oh my concept of time was going to get a workout this weekend that's for sure, usually it takes more than 2 beers to keep me up that late but hey there's a first time for everything. Yay, Power's back my eyes were hurting!

So my friends have planned for me a trip to me to a village, the home town of the lady (I prefer not to use peoples names out of respect) so I can see the farmlands and some beautifully hidden/non tourist regions. Our trip was delayed due to only getting to sleep at 4pm the previous morning, it was further delayed due to a small traffic incident, I was not in the car but breakfast was going to be. Breakfast of Idli wala and some chutneys, so yummy. We finally hit the road around 2pm and it takes us 2hrs to get out of Bangalore traffic, on to the highway. Stopping at toll booth, men are trying to sell stuff, coming up to inspect me one by one, very intimidating but it's ok
View on the way to Jain Temple
the window was shut and doors locked. We reach our first destination, a boys orphanage where a guru of 110 years lives and oversees the care of these orphans, feeding up to 10,000 people per day, incredible place, there was an energy there I can't quite describe. We went up to see the temple and a young boy said a prayer for me, giving me some powder that is said to be auspicious and I should keep for as long as possible, unfortunately I may be meeting customs on that but that's yet to be seen. I got so see the guru to, a very tall man dressed in orange, sitting giving people blessings. My friend told me that he over heard some of the boys saying comments that they were proud that a white woman came to see their place, how lovely! From here we continue to the ladies town, Tiptur, it rained a bit on the way, so soothing and refreshing in the heat. I check in to a hotel, a more comfortable sleeping/shower option and then we head to her parents place to meet them. Such genuine and happy people greet me and feed me the traditional
Largest single stone statue
sweet pancake with fruit salad then rice and sambal. Yum. Then off to meet the cousins, so many people were there, many with no understanding of english except for the work bye. They were so keen to talk to me they would just address me directly like I understood and me to them, obviously there was a translation happening through my friend but still it was nice to be addressed directly. So yep another late night.

7am In the morning I'm back to her parents for traditional breakfast (will have to get back to you with the name) and coffee. Then we set off on our adventure, first travelling a mere 20 min to the village were her aunties and uncles farm Coconut, Tiptur is famous for coconut and boy were they delicious, I got to drink 2 fresh ones from the tree, eat 2 fresh mangoes and some jackfruit, I'd never had jackfruit, it's so sweet tastes like a lolly! The family were so proud to be getting me all these fresh treats, it was super special for me. The air was so fresh, the farm so peaceful. Again different family member were talking to me like I
Intricate details in Belur
knew what they were saying, such a happy bunch, joking with each other. I was hoping to see a peacock but 2 puppies and plenty of Buffalo was what I got and I was happy with that. Then we drove on to a Jain Temple in Shravanabelagola, home to the biggest single stone statue (a naked man, I could go in to more history but that would take forever). You have to climb around 500 stairs barefoot to see it and there are some very old preserved carvings in the rock. The view was spectacular, surrounded by coconut farms and bodies of water. Many women asked to have their picture taken with me, I found this very amusing and felt like some weird celebrity! It was a beautiful sunny day also so this was a wonderful experience especially the stones burning the underside of my feet making me literally want to run up and down the hill. We then continued to Hassan for lunch and afterwards drove to Belur to see another temple with ancient stone carvings, oh my was this stunning! Such intricate details of hand carved stone dating back to the 1700's. All of the gods, Bharatnatym positions,
Snake Charriot
animals and Karma sutra positions carved around the outside of a gorgeous temple, I had no energy for a tour but was happy observing the workmanship, so delicate and precise, no 2 pieces the same, such craftsmanship you will probably never see in this day. A must see! After a quick stop outside Belur at a water catchment to get some fresh air, we then journeyed to Halebidu to see another temple crafted in the same way. This temple seemed to have preserved better and the grounds were really well maintained with greenery and a garden surrounding it. The temple in Belur was stone as far as the eye could see, so I enjoyed the feel of Halebidu more. They had some rather big statues of the cow god and plenty of carvings of other gods, the mind boggles with all the stories that were encapsulated around these buildings, represented by these figures of worship.

Then on to the road and my what a road this was. There were so many holes, so many different surfaces, for kilometres and kilometres, it felt like we were driving to the end of the world! So many lorry vans and truck
Halebidu
rolled by with so many people packed on to them, it was so strange to see! I'm told the roads are being fixed in India now, under the new government and my god they would want to be, I thought we would never be able to get over some of the terrain but we merrily bumped our way along, cracking jokes about it because there was no way around this road. They had freshly made one part and used big rocks to block people from riding over it instead of those orange bollard things, very environmentally friendly. Some parts had the bitumen spread at different levels so there were some bizarre speed bumps. It was truly an experience like no other, especially seeing the amount of people travelling on the road. We were joking that they were fitting entire villages into rickshaws, only in India! When we finally got off that road and on to the good highway I felt sad a little, the rough road was way more fun, albeit slow. When we finally arrived back in Tiptur, it was the cousins turn to feed me. I tried a bit of a ragi ball, this weird purplish flour thing
Grounds at Halebidu
you are not meant to chew, took 2 mouthfuls and thought I may choke, I am really not used to eating semi solid food without chewing, no one was offended, quite contrary, impressed I had a taste. So I happily ate the best Chippatis I have had with some Mutton curry and fried chicken, so tasty, I was really spoiled this weekend, but by the time I got to finish my dinner it was close to 11pm and since I was running on very little sleep I was super duper tired, it was worth it! The head lady of the house did her traditional ceremony placing a bindi on my forehead and saying a prayer for me, giving me 2 Bananas, some leaf and Betal nuts. This ceremony only happens for the women, I felt privileged or and I got to have a picture with the baby.

I learnt something very valuable this weekend; It does not matter what culture you are from or what type of upbringing you have had, if you remove all preconceived ideas about what a person will be like due to the others of their culture/religion/country you have met you will see the true person, the soul and on a very uniquely primitive, human level you will connect, regardless of language barriers. People can really surprise you if you let them. Also, listening is the key to learning about a person, and willingness to let go a bit of yourself will allow you to experience them and what they believe, this is very important to building an understanding of each other.

So now back to Bangalore, the Rain and dancing. Oh and my fever/cold only lasted 2 days. It is advisable to get a good rest each night so you don't wear yourself out and become susceptible to foreign bugs. Now I really am finding my feet and loving the experience of this crazy place.

Published: June 23rd 2014


This was to be one of the hardest weeks of my life - I just didn't know it yet! It is not until I leave the airport that the gravity of my decision hits me, It's 1am Sunday Morning, my escort leads me straight on to the road where we are walking amongst the taxi traffic, which is hectic by the way, there is absolutely no system on the roads here, people just do whatever they want, horns honking. After finally getting ushered to the cab rank and getting in the cab we are off in to the extremeness of the traffic. It truly has to be seen for one to even grasp how crazy it is on the road (there is 'no traffic' right now either because it's so early, oh my!), I thought I was not going to make it or that we would crash for sure, but some how in all the chaos the people seem to manage, like it's second nature. After one hour we reach our destination, A wonderfully big apartment I get to have to myself for the next two months a blessing after a long stint on couches, sublets and my old room at my folks place, compliments of Attakallari Centre for Movements Arts where I am due to start work monday and what a day monday was, but I'll get to that shortly. I'm left with not much information except for a dinosaur nokia mobile with no internet, great! I go to have a shower to find there is no hot water, well I know there is now because a friend showed me how the systems work here, but I have no idea, so I'll been having cold showers for an entire week, this is ok in fact because it is so warm and lovely a big jump from the bitterness of the Australian winter. After coming to terms with this I sleep.

I have a good friend in Bangalore who picked me up after I awoke and took me on a tour of the city. I'm thinking this was wonderful, I'm feeling like I can cope with this forgetting that I am cushioned from the real environment of the city in his luxury car and his knowledge of were to go (he took me to a palace for lunch, very lovely grounds so lush and green!). I only came to realise how intense the city was the next day (monday) early morning as I was trawling the streets with no idea in hell where I am going. I was given vague directions from my land lady, who I had to ask what the address for my house was because no one told me that either, asking many many people as they went by to point me in the right direction going around and around in circles for an hour looking for a place I'm told should have taken less than ten minutes. The stink of garbage and god knows what else made this experience even more difficult, getting stared at, honked at as I need to take the road because the foot path is non existent, laughed at, disregarded.... Why no one showed me or came to pick me up I have no clue, but by the time a rickshaw driver with decent english finally pointed me to the right road, only to be greeted by a security man I had no hope in hell understanding or explaining that I was there to work, my nerves were so frazzled and I could not keep the tears back. I'm sitting outside the place now being stared down by the cleaning ladies, the security man telling me for half an hour about how it costs one lac to buy a suzuki and me sitting there thinking what in the world possessed me to do this! the lady I have been speaking to arrives and I finally get to talk sense with someone. I get taken inside after the yoga class and am introduced to the majority of my 28 students, I am calming down now! I get to watch their next class, Kalarippayattu, Indian Martial Art. A highly physical discipline consisting of different series of deep squats and kicking. know I am going to learn a lot from observing the traditional movement disciplines but am so hungry so I do not stay to watch Bharatnataym (classical indian dance). On my way how I got head butted by a cow, apparently I stepped to close to his head, but I had no choice, he was on the footpath! I am going home to eat because I am very weary of the local restaurants, they look unhygenic and I would have no clue what to order anyway, on the way I ask the internet shop man about getting a dongle, and he just shakes his head and hand at me and continually says no. Far out nothing is going my way today! I get back and now it's time to take the role for my ballet class, oh what a joke that was, Half of the names I have no idea about, I make a joke of this but I'm feeling rather vulnerable here! So thats over we get on with the class, I am testing their skill level today for both ballet and contemporary and can see gaps in their knowledge immediately, this gives me my confidence back. The universal language of the body and what it needs. There are a few knee and shoulder issues, I think this is great not for the students obviously but now I know where to direct my training and what the students need for strength. Dance really can lift your spirits and give you freedom even when your nerves are completely shot out, bringing a joy and forgetting about the crazy desire in my heart to run back to Australia. The day has ended now time to find food, but first I am given the Wifi code and an internet dongle now, sweet relief I can tell my loved ones I have not died in the flight! I go the the place recommended and once again I have no idea what to order and surprise surprise the workers don't speak english! So much for being told that Bangalore is a big city you will be fine many people speak english, well today they didn't. I get something finally, the people there are nice enough. Going home was a tad frightening, I don't think I'm in a very safe area for a woman to walk alone at night, yet another amazing bonus for the day! I get home and take a cold shower and hand wash my clothes (something I will be doing a lot from now on). Finally taking solace in the adult cartoon Archer, red wine and sleep.

Jetlag wakes me at 4am the next morning, silence, oh sweet silence where have you been? I'm grateful for being up so early, by 5am a beautiful singing can be heard, I find out later that it is from the church down the road calling people to pray. I find this very soothing. My friend picks me up and takes me for a walk in the park and breakfast, iggly and Masala dosa, delicious. The home to prepare a ballet lesson, before heading in to watch the Bharatnataym class. How expressive and beautiful this dance is, powerful in rhythmic grounding and light in characterisation of the face with fluidity of the upper body and clarity of mudras of the hands. very powerful! After break they come back, we dance together, the students seem to really enjoy my lessons, they later tell me that they love my classes and are having fun, that they always found ballet boring but not with me... The imagery I have been focusing on must work, very good research for my studies into ideokinesis and obsession with ways to make the physicality easy even when the movement is tough, correcting alignment with image and anatomical facts. They clap for me when I do even the simplest of steps, I feel so fabulous, it's a real pleasure to be admired and to feel that through a friendly less demanding nature I can see great improvement and deepen the awareness of their bodies with them. This really is a shared learning experience. I can see a very very distinct difference in culture by the way the students respect me and respond to me. They have very little care for being self conscious and self esteem seems high, they are friendly and supportive to each other, none seem to have a competitive bone in their body. One thing I find so hilarious is the customary head movement for ok, I ask if it is understood and due to this sideways head wobble I have no idea if they mean yes or no. The rest of the week continues like this. Going to and from the studio not going to far from home, I am brave enough one evening, desperate for some meat to eat that I take the rickshaw to the main road. Holy moly, rickshaws are hilarious, a bit frightening at first but funny none the less, I'm glad I've been told how much I should pay though because I can see myself being ripped off very easily. I also take one trip on the back of a students scooter to see a very dismal dance show in a pub, this was scary, I told him he was brave for riding a scooter there as I clung to him fearing for my life! I am getting very tired of being stared at by the end of the week, I feel sensitive and am going in and out of homesickness, loneliness, absolute blinding moments of inspiration and joy, very surreal almost. I see the dirt and rubbish in the street, wild dogs, cows , monkeys turkeys and can not understand how are why people must live this way, how is this chaos possible? It is so far beyond my grasp!

I met a lovely man in the plane on the way over, who would by the end of the week end up being like my family. He told me not to fight India and I would have a good time, but by friday I feel desperate to escape, my stomach has started aching, I have not been eating well as I still have no clue what to eat. He invites me over friday evening after I finish work. Friday was hard for me, the students support and love really picked me up and we did a slow massage/stretch class as they were tired and to be honest I had little energy. I stayed back late having philosophical convocations with some students, still after they leave I feel lonely and I am grateful for the invitation to stay the night with a friend. His company driver picks me up. Nice guy we had a lovely chat and he took me down what I can only describe as the most dangerous road I have ever been down. I arrive at his door and his wife greets me with a tray with contains a sweet smelling candle, and powder, she dots my head with the powder and feeds me an almond. This is truly one of the most special experiences I have ever had, I want to cry with joy and relief. Her neighbour and daughter come by, they are so excited to meet me and we stay up the entire night talking laughing and I feel like I have found long lost relatives. The next day I am thankful to be there, my stomach has given up, it's time for the inevitable travel bug to hit me, full blown gastro, my stomach feels like it is going to come violently out of my mouth. I sleep for more than fifteen hours, cry and want to seriously run home. They care for me like I have never experienced, with pure unconditional love. I am so thankful, the universe really helped me when it sat me next to this man on the plane. After this, the next day I feel better. I have been dreaming vividly and feel an undeniable guilt for wanting to leave my students, I can not leave them, I must endure, I will feel better. They take me out and make sure I am stocked up with good quality food, both are from farming regions so we speak the same language when it comes to quality produce. I'm feeling better now, all I needed was a little help and a little love. So here ends my first week in India, I can say that I have indeed been shocked and the advice I have for the solo traveller is find a friend, you need them! Also no expectation is best.

Bryn knew early on that some his undercover work was going to require him to blend in with the locals.
Hello you beautiful people.

Firstly I am so sorry that it has been so long since my last blog post, I appreciate that you have not all been sat round, wringing your hands, deep in worry for me, but I still need to say sorry.

Ok, so when I left off last time I was heading to Bangalore to meet with my old friend Bryn to work on his thesis for his masters degree in Primatology. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect but I knew Bryn, so I knew it wouldn’t be dull….

Now then, the truth is I can’t get in too many details about the process for reasons I will explain later but I can tell you about what this has morphed in to and the findings.

What started out as looking at the ritual torture of wildlife has turned in to a weird study in to Black Magic.

So let me explain. Bryn always had some evidence that his chosen primate, the Slender Loris, was being used in Black Magic but this has developed in to a study about the use of both illegal ,and legal, wildlife in Black Magic sacrifices.
IMG_2222
Not a terrible office....

Oooooh and what a strange world it is. It ranges from the relatively harmless things such as marrying two frogs to bring the rains, to blowing up a flap shelled turtle to release the treasure inside. I have so many example of these beliefs it goes on and on….

If you keep a Red Sand Boa snake under your safe it will protect your fortune. The idea is that the Red Sand Boa appears to have two heads, so it can see in both directions and will see folk coming to grab your fortune.

Therefore traders will split the tail of the snake and pin fake eyes in the tail so it appears that the snake has two heads.

And then it gets stranger……….the heavier the snake the better protection it brings. So traders started to force-feed the snake ball bearings to increase the weight.

Buyers started to work this scam out so they started to feel for the ball bearings in the gut of the snake.

Traders got wise to this…..so now they force-feed the snake liquid mercury so that buyers cannot detect the artificial weight increase. It doesn’t really matter that the snake

will die within a few hours, once the money has exchanged hands it is too late.

And more……

Legend has it if you see a Jackal when you wake up it gives you good luck. So some folk will keep Jackal captive at home and when they wake up they will head straight to the cage (without seen anyone else) so the first thing they see in morning is the Jackal.

During the recent elections a pot containing the head of a Jackal was found outside the parliament building. This suggests (as do our interviews) that this sort of stuff is far more prevalent then you would have thought. It certainly is not just restricted to “uneducated” rural areas.

No, these beliefs permeate the political and legal classes.

Now I would love for you to think of me as some sort of Indiana Jones type, but the truth is most my work as a research assistant is pretty dull, typing up notes and referencing documents, in a clean and safe apartment in Bangalore.

It really is not that exciting. And for good reason. The truth is that if two white faces turn up to

interview a poacher or a practitioner their suspicion will double. These guys already realise they are on the wrong side of the law and are only talking because of the promise of money, we can’t spook them even more.

There is a serious aim to all this study. Every time a Jaca is captured or a Flap Shelled Turtle is blown up, there is one less. When there are no more Hyenas or Flap Shelled Turtles left poachers and practitioners will start to use other similar species until they are decimated too. This study could be used to try and convince religious and spiritual leaders to turn their back on these practices. This will not be easy though, there is a huge amount of money involved in this trade. Others have tried and failed. But it could help.

Anyhoo.

I am going to support Bryn in this venture until around the 25th of June and then I am going to take off for a while. Still not sure exactly what I am going to do. I am going to stay in India until the 26th of July (when my Visa expires). I am thinking about heading over

Everything is easy in Thailand……….unlike India….which is a struggle… Our favorite phrase at the moment is “wither the challenge”. You set off to achieve something on a day but within an hour you feel withered.

So, all my biggest love to you for reading this, I appreciate it more than you will ever know.

We set out for Hampi with a lot of expectations as we had heard so much about it and seen such wonderful pictures. The sheer vastness, complexity and craftsmanship of the place left us awestruck and we were left wondering as to how something like this was built and sustained so many centuries ago. The pictures have been taken at various locations like Vittala, Virupaksha and Krishna temple complexes....and we were not in the least bit disappointed.

Goa, Hampi and on to Bangalore


3rd Class sleeper class train to Hampi
We were warned about children being above us on bunks and having little 'accidents' on us which had us on full alert!
We last minute decided to go to Hampi, we weren't going to bother as its a pain to get to but we re routed ourselves and could get from Hampi to Bangalore and from here we could continue south to Kerala, we also looked at lots of pictures on the internet and decided we had to go if we were near it.

Hampi itself is a small village built as close as possible to the sights and literally there to cater for the tourists, all the locals live up the road In Hospet near the train station. Hampu itself is a UNESCO heritage site as the ruins within it are from the Vijayanagara Empire. The historical sights can be dated back to 1343 - so VERY old. There are many Hindu temples, military buildings (including an elephant garage!) and civil building to explore. We had given ourselves a couple of days to have a look around the place and some of the main sights.

We travelled by train from Goa to Hampi in Air Con (AC) 3 tier which was more than Ok, this means bunks of three beds with the bottom bunk being used to sit on during
Hampi
the day and at night they all fold down for beds. This is the last tier of ac compartments, the next step down is non ac and non booking of seats so a free for all and we werent quite ready to try that with all our bags. There with lots and lots of locals around us which was great, this tier of the train was very busy with people and luggage who have a little bit more money to upgrade to this class. One family kept coming down the train with boxes and suitcases and room was running very low, we put a couple of suitcases under my bed and they were all around us, then the family came down and there was around 15 of them all having different berths around the train but wanting to sit together which after some doing what they wanted to do and not backing down they won with other people changing seats to accomodate them. After around 30 minutes they started eating, they had brought the biggest spread lve ever seen, shopping bag full if cooked rice, chappatis galore and lots of curry and finally cakes and cakes and cakes. We decided
Hampi
they must have come from a wedding and brought all the left overs. It did look delicious, and the mum fed all the men first and waited for them to finish before sorting her own food out. What dedication. We kept looking over hoping for a plate full but to no avail, we made do with the train food of a fried vegetable cutlet in bread and a masala tea. The train was so busy with people walking up and down and the tea and food sellers moving up and down the train. With this and the scenery ever changing from the green lush lands of south Goa turning into more baron landscape of the Karnataka area it was a good journey. The train took around 10 hours so we were in by dinner time to Hampi.

We got probably a very overpriced tuk tuk to Hampi and looked around for somewhere to stay. Coming into Hampi felt like being transported to another world and reminded me so much of The Flintstones and Bedrock. India's landscape is so diverse l would never of though the terrain in Hampi would be possible! It was very dry with HUGE boulders thrown
Roaming around the beautiful sights
Hampi
around, like marbles giants would play with. Then amongst these boulders were the number one attractions of the temples. We bargained down a decent room which had a roof terrace so we could watch the sunset over one of the main temples which was pretty much on our door step. Having had a delicuous nut curry we found a tuk tuk driver to take us around the sights the next day (the area is vast and walking is out of the question to do it all in a day or two), we agreed a pick up time and hit the hay getting an earlyish night ready for the next day.

Our guy rocked up 30 minutes late which meant we were worried he wasnt coming and we were panicking about what to do as we were aiming to leave the next day meaning we would miss out on seeing the temples we wanted to as we would have to find another driver. Whoops all round when he arrived and we started the day. We saw tons of temples and after a few they started to merge into one, same same but different. It was also BOILING!..we ate lots of
Unless you have an elephant garage you havent made it
Hampi
ice creams which lasted about 10 seconds before melting due to the heat, and drank lots of water, near the end we were just chilling in the tuk tuk with the driver as we were too hot and tired to move. Our driver was lovely and everything went well until he started telling us about his life and the guilt trip kicked in. He told us about how he was practically an orphan after his entire family had died from various illness's. We listened intently and was reminded of how different peoples lives can be, as well as thinking and hoping that his story was true and not a scam for more money out of us.

On the plus side he did help us out getting a package posted home so things werent too bad. Some word of warning - posting packages back to the Uk is a huge pain!...you have to find a box, take it to a tailors and have it sewn up, then take it to a post office to be sent away. As with India, a simple thing takes forever and is never as easy as you think and the time yo think it will
Craigs fan club continues..
Hampi
take will actually take 5x along. Our guy helped us with all of this and we probably paid more for the sewing up part than a local but still only cost a few quid.

One attraction l enjoyed was the elephant garage! it was huge, you know you've made it when you need a garage to keep your elephants in. Another highlight was meeting and talking to a guy selling sugar cane water. He even let Craig make our juice which was fun and surprisingly hard work.

Our last stop of the day was to climb a rather high hill to watch the sunset. This did not go to plan, we followed what we thought was the path- there were arrows but we still managed to take the wrong arrow ending up in someones back garden!..we thought we were back on track but got scared as l read about mountain bears roaming around and also we saw a LOT of HUGE monkeys (rabies alert) up where we wanted to be..we were also the only tourists heading up there which l wasnt loving. so we made it half way, decided we could get a good view of sunset from
Freshly fresh lemonade to cool us down
Hampi
there and thats where we sat.

The next day we attempted to leave Hampi...we had tried to book train tickets to Bangalore and were on the waiting list - we started at 10 and moved down to 2 during the course of the day we were meant to leave, with a couple of hours to go before the train left we were at 1, so we crossed our fingers and after a bit of a mad dash through the roads of Hampi fearing for the tuk tuk to roll over after a couple of hair raising bends we made it to the train station. We checked with the booking office and we weren't on the train - Plan B was to go in unreserved class. We had done this once but it was empty and was during the day, we decided if we got on (after the stampeed of people) we would have to take it in shifts to sleep and not take any food or drink offered to us as it would most likely have some sort of sleeping drug in it so we would fall asleep and wake up very robbed. If we were lucky we may
Man on his own journey
Hampi
be able to buy our way onto the AC tiered sleeper. The train arrived and after looking through the windows of the un-reserveed class and lack of seating and any space, followed by the hundred people trying to get on we abandoned Plan B and had a pep talk/team meeting on the platform to form Plan C.

Plan C - As we left the train station still with no idea what to do, a tuk tuk driver started to talk to us as we thought we had first arrived and needed a lift to Hampi. After explaining our situation the very well spoken Tuk tuk driver suggested we get a sleeper bus to Bangalore from here we could catch a bus down to Kerala, so we headed to Hospet for a look and see if this was possible. Hospet as l said was more where the locals live and was all hustle and bustle, real Indian restaurants, homeless people and really more like India than Hampi. The bus for that night was full but our guy sorted us on the next nights one and was so kind and helpful to us. Next plan was to find somewhere to stay,
Sunset on the lookout for bears
Hampi
Instead of heading back to Hampi we deceied to stay in Hospet and take in the authenticity of it all and thought the money we would save on going back and fourth to Hampi and difference in food cost would get us into the ONLY hotel in Hospet. This was the BEST decision we had made and our second EMERGENCY hotel for a night situation since arriving in India (in the whole trip so far we have only needed one other emergency night in a hotel and that was in Bolivia, but i think twice in India isn't too bad..i mean this is India where things can go wrong and not to plan all the time). The hotel was clean, the room cold, the shower hot, a computer where we could print things off and there was a television with english channels!..The staff werent as good and the tuk tuk driver was x10 nicer with much better english language but it was great and we relished it for the night!.. This hotel was a 24 hour hotel which worked very well for us, so the time you check in the time you leave 24 hours exactly. After a lovely sleep
Super comfortable double bed for sleep and cuddles en route to Bangalore
and nice breakfast we chilled in our room then headed our to see what Hospet had to offer. One great thing was eating in a real indian restaurant with prices to match. We ate a delicious Thali meal which cost around £1 and was very filling. We stayed in our room and watched some english tv before walking over to the bus station to catch our sleeper bus down to Bangalore.

The bus to bangalore was a unique and new experience for us, this wasn't a regular coach in that you sat in a seat, oh no, you got a double bed to share!..WOW!!!. this actually was a great experience and facilitated a rather good kip and a cuddle which is unusual on a night bus! I didnt want to think about the health and safety aspect but we made it no problems whatsoever, probably best we were able to sleep so couldnt hear all the horns and feel the swerving of the bus all night making our minds race!

We arrived in Bangalore at 6am from the sleeper bus. The hotel we were checking into was a 24hour hotel which meant we would have to check out
24hours later with our next bus at 7pm that night. We asked to add some hours on and the reception man responded with somewhat a dr.Evil laugh followed by a firm 'NO', great!...As not to dwell we got to our box room and had some kip, we were going to need it!...we got a few hours kip and headed out to see what Bangalore had to offer.

First thing was not being able to get a tuk tuk, then the one we found refused to even agree on a price anywhere near what we been advised to pay by the hotel...this wasn't looking good. Finally after asking about 5 taxi drivers and arguing over 50p and 1pounds (it's the principle) we got moving to the main shopping area for some air con action and 'stuff'. Stuff to us means anything western we can look at or even eat. Just as a change from what we had been having, and the ability to buy toiletries. We decided Pizza Hut would be a nice treat -I have no idea why when I don't eat Pizza Hut at home -but it was there and it was western, we had had local food
Bangalore
for 6 weeks so we gave it a go. We ordered the royal pizza, what a mistaka to maka!..YUK! we regretted it almost instantly, our poor tummies were not used to processed rubbish in those pizza's. We felt sluggish, full, had cramps and generally came to wonder what they actually put in processed food! I think we have been eating lots of pure foods for a couple of months that our bodies could not handle the crap found in a Pizza Hut pizza...lesson learnt.

We relaxed the rest of the day in preparation for the following long day to come. We got an early night and set our alarms for our 6am check out time.

At 6am we were up and ready and decided to have some breakfast then hang around the lobby for a couple of hours in the vain hope they would just give us a room...this was not going to happen so around 8am we headed to the botanical gardens and had a lazy wander looking at the pretty flowers and relaxed sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of Bangalore. Another treat today was going to see the new spider man movie in 3D
Bangalore beautifulness
which was showing at the local cinema...getting there, walking around the mall, having lunch and watching the film killed some more time and before we knew it it was time for the bus.

This time the bus was a regular coach and it turned out to be a regular Indian journey, by Indian standards. This meant, lots of swerving whilst driving, emergency breaking, playing very loud music all night which meant we generally spent the time not very relaxed and feeling like we were being tortured as the music was so loud you couldn't sleep. I honestly think that 37 hour bus journey in Argentina killed my bum and sitting down for long time skills. After a couple of hours I couldn't do anything to get it not hurting-maybe if l eat some more pies/curry/masala dosa it will become more cushioned?

This is my first travel blog anywhere and would love to hear your feedback.

I will start with a brief introduction about Hampi.

Hampi is a village in northern Karnataka state, India. It is located within the ruins of Vijayanagara, the former capital of the Vijayanagara Empire. Predating the city of Vijayanagara, it continues to be an important religious centre, housing the Virupaksha Temple, as well as several other monuments belonging to the old city. The ruins are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, listed as the Group of Monuments at Hampi.

My friend Giri n myself headed for a weekend trip to Hampi towards end of Feb 2014. We travelledd by bus from Bangalore and was an 8 hours journey. On Saturday morning, we rented a motor bike and headed for seeing around Hampi. Ride from our hotel to Hampi was wonderful with an amazing view of paddy fields on one side of the road and sugar cane farms on the other side. We reached Hampi after an hour ride through the villages and farm lands, surounded by mountains.

We could see demolished and partly renovated Hindu temples in each and every corner of that old city. It is hard to
DSC05953
explain the architecture and stone art of those monuments. Each design looked better than the rest.Many of the monuments were destroyed by the Muslim invaders hundreds of years back and some are being renovated. Crowd was less as it was an off-peak season due to summer temperatures, close to 40 C .

Due to time constraints, we had to limit our visit to a few of the temples on the first day and on the second way we headed for the bear sanctuary which was a two hours ride and watched feeding the bears. Then we headed to Tunga Badra Dam to view the sunset, where we hiked a nearby hill to get a better view of the horizon. We were back at the hotel by 8 PM and it was almost the time to catch the return bus. We returned happily with minds full of memories about that beautiful city.

I have attached a few photos from my trip here. I hope you enjoyed it and please do leave your comments. Thank you.

Commerce continues despite the roadworks in downtown Gulbarga
The night passed without incident....a pre-ordered breakfast of Indian stuff arrived 20 minutes late, we part consumed, then set off. Stopped to visit a couple of tombs on the outskirts of town then on to Gulbarga.

In 1991 a man called Michael Kent wrote a detailed description of the Deccan sights, an interesting book though one which will detain no-one unless they David's interest in these matters. He mentioned that in Gulbarga, a foul and unpleaceable odour emanated from the fetid green moat. The moat has long since dried up but we can report that same odour now seems to engulf you wherever you go in the town.......more 14th century battlements, mosques etc, but we had to flee because of the stink.

The day however gets better because unbeknownst to us or our driver, Narendra Modi, the national leader of the BJP, the Hindu extremist-ish party, was holding an election rally in Gulbarga this very day. We had to go down the road where seemingly several hundred thousand of his flag waving supporters were massing. Lots of older gentlemen in Nehru caps and dhotis, lots of energetic youths, all of whom peered into our car looking and pointing at the two whities. David decided to respond with the wave perfected by H.M.Queen. Just the hour in a traffic jam then.......eventually we hit the road to Bijapur, across another 100 miles of featureless Deccani countryside. You have to earn your history and culture around these parts.

Bijapur. A name that resonates through medieval India history, but let's be honest, it is another dusty dump of a town these days. We check in to the Shashinag Residence, “the best hotel in town”. Oh dear God, standards are plumbing new depths here. James, we have now found a hotel lower than the Gaddafi era hotel we stayed in at Benghazi.........toilet window needing to be papered up, light fitting to be replaced.....probably built in the 80s and has not been dusted since. .....what a sh*thole. The people running it clearly know not the first thing about hotel management, though the resident biologist has cultured an interesting green algae not previously known to man in the “swimming” pool.....what a sh*thole. Some Indian youths were spotted disporting themselves in the pool this afternoon......a fleet of ambulances have just arrived at the hotel and a number of youths removed on stretchers....unrelated I am sure.

To our amazement we stumble into two other Europeans, who sadly turn out to be curt nodding and heel clicking East Germans, probably a shot-putting couple, who speak no English apparently other than “two beers” which they keep repeating frequently.

Dinnertime. We stumble into the “food bazaar” in the basement – perhaps they meant food bizarre? Anyway for once we are pleasantly surprised that the food is edible and some 24 hours on the bowels remain closed, so that is a positive. £3.20 for a lavish dinner including a litre of premium Kingfisher.

Somnathpur temple
Never again to see her sandals.....
Our last day in India was supposed to be a quiet day with nothing to do. Things don’t always turn out as planned.

Mr Ali advises us when we leave Mysore that our airport hotel in Bangalore is a 3 ½ hour drive away, so we ask to stop off at one more temple on the way. It’s a small but imposing 13th century temple with just a French woman and a group of three Indians as the only other visitors. As ever, we are told to leave our sandals at the entrance. We stack them neatly in a concrete compartment and look round the temple, which takes under 20 minutes. When we come to leave, Sara’s blue sandals have been replaced with a small black pair. Some mistake, surely? Gradually the awful truth dawns that her sandals are no longer there. We ask the man who purported to be the shoe attendant. He tells us the other visitors took the sandals and laughs. Sara does not find this amusing. We accost , in turn, the security guard, the ticket seller and a guide taking round three newly arrived Irish tourists. The gist of their replies is that none of
Mrs Bond in the Temple of Doom
them is to blame and nothing can be done. We enlist the help of Mr Ali who conducts vigorous conversations/arguments. Still the shoe attendant smirks and says looking after shoes is not his job and anyway, surely I have other footwear. David avoids the impulse to punch his face in, with difficulty.

Mindful of the need for a police report if we are to try to claim on the insurance, we ask where the police station is. The Somnathpur Police Out Post (sic) is a mere 200 yards away. Further discussion ensues between them and Mr Ali. They come with us to the temple and carefully search all round it, as if somebody might have just hidden the sandals as a joke. Nobody had. We ask for a police report and are told that has to be done by an inspector, at a bigger police station. We drive there. More discussion, with ever more people joining in in. Only one guy is in uniform but they all seem to be police officers. Eventually Sara is handed a blank piece of paper and asked to write out her ‘complaint’. She does so. Yet more discussion, and they all head off
David at Somnathpur
to a separate room – to file the report, we are told. They return and ask Sara to rewrite the complaint, this time describing the sandals as missing rather than stolen. Presumably this is to ensure their crime statistics (carefully recorded by year and type of crime on a blackboard) are not tainted by an unsolved sandal robbery. Finally someone appears who speaks some English. After checking several times that all we want is a record that we have reported to the loss to the police (ie no form of investigation) he makes further phone calls to someone called “sir” and tells us he will type up a report. This, he assures us, will take just 10 minutes.

As we sit waiting in the plastic chairs, we are kindly offered tea or coffee. We ask for our fallback request of ‘black tea no sugar’ which causes much consternation. After 15 minutes, two small cups of staggeringly strong white tea arrive, each with a quarter lemon which is pointed out to us with much pride. We accept with effusive thanks and, under the watchful eye of all concerned, squeeze out our lemons into the tiny cups of tea, which we

then drink with great shows of enthusiasm. Actually, the lemon serves to dilute the otherwise undrinkable concentrate of tannin into something halfway tolerable. After a further wait, the report is finally brought downstairs. All is not yet complete however. Sara has to sign one copy, and the desk sergeant has to sign and stamp it. The sheet is the folded with a flourish and put into an envelope for us. The English speaking officer (well, we assume he is an officer but as he’s not in uniform he could just be a helpful passer-by) informs us with a grin that we are the first foreigners they have ever had to deal with, they were not sure of the correct procedure to deal with foreigners and hence the call to Police HQ. This is also the first ever reported loss of footwear! The latter is probably not surprising as everyone we see seems to wear a 10 rupee pair of flipflops.

Emotionally exhausted, we pile back into the car and set off for Bangalore. The journey seems to be proceeding OK until we he hit the outskirts of the city and discover that the flyover/ring road has been closed as a result of the construction of an overhead metro line. This dooms us to the best part of 2 hours driving through the centre of Bangalore, a sort of urban hell, past the wholesale market and down narrow streets under the now closed flyover. Filth everywhere, cows wandering, cows and wretched humans alike sleeping in the filth on the central reservation. Traffic chaos and mayhem beyond description.

Finally we reach our ‘airport hotel’ at 4.45pm. Mr Ali has offered to drive us to the airport in the morning, as it is now too late for him to drive home today. We ask the unsmiling man at reception how long it will take to drive to the airport given we need to be there at 6am latest for an 8am flight. ‘One hour’ he replies. One hour, for an airport hotel???



Still, the good news is that the hotel is clean and the room comfortable (though it is a shame that there is an external light pointing straight into our bedroom through the exceedingly thin curtains). And a big bottle of Kingfisher is only 160 rupees (£1.60) for 650ml. We sit and drink while waiting for dinner sitting somewhat incongruously in a large dining room laid out with enormous wicker furniture which looks like it should be in the garden, and elaborate curtains with draped pelmets that should be in a country house. And bowtied waiters. Bizarre.

Kail Devi temple
We come down to breakfast to find the party of Canadian tourists unable to leave the hotel. The Maharajah explains that the Jats are causing “some agitation” back towards Bharatpur where we were a few days ago. Within the caste system, the Jats are a relatively high caste of farmers and they are complaining about the injustices (as they see them) of the quota system by which the lower castes, the dalits and the tribals get preferential treatment when applying for jobs, government positions, university places etc. The higher castes feel this positive discrimination has gone too far these days, and periodically these grievances spill over into agitation and worse. The Jat king had his seat at Bharatpur and so Bharatpur district is suffering some disruption, not least the blocking of the road to Agra. This is where the Canadians were heading so at the moment they are stuck at the Bhanwar Vilas. It seems the Jats have also caused havoc in Delhi by sabotaging the water supply to about 60% of the population. The Maharajah seems to have some sympathy with the Jats' complaints; clearly many Indians feel the quota system, originally introduced for a ten year period in 1951,
Kail Devi guesthouse
has now tipped the balance too far in the other direction. Bring back the Raj! At least everyone knew the system was fair in those halcyon days.....

The morning is taken up with a visit to the Kaila Devi temple outside town. This is the other temple whose temple trust is run by the Maharajah. A faithful retainer is summoned to accompany the honoured guests, which is a relief as it ensures we do not get lost. The temple itself is not that old, but is clearly revered all over India for its presiding deity. We get the preferential treatment, which we have never had in a Hindu temple before, which makes the visit much more interesting. We leave our shoes in the private cloakroom, get the marigold garlands on arrival (!), have the deity and her abode explained to us (lots of silver and gold work around), process around the sanctum, and then do the other stuff – visit the shotgun armed temple guard on the roof, see the storeroom, visit the “barracks” for the temple security staff, see their mess hall, stuff you never realise exists within a temple precincts. There is also a dining hall where
Well
poor people can come and eat free of charge, courtesy of the temple trust. We also go out into the village to see one of the guest houses, where pilgrims can come and stay for free if they have come from afar to worship and the deep wells lined with stone carvings. Then on to the Maharajah's personal guest house that has been opened up specially so the esteemed guests can stop for a wee. We carry on to one of his outlying farms to inspect this fruit trees and wheat fields. All fascinating stuff! And not something you get to do as an average visitor.



Some people might feel this ancient system of the Maharajah retaining his title and exercising his ancient responsibilities to his “subjects” is old fashioned and has no place in the modern world. But where is the harm in it? He provides livelihood and support to hundreds if not thousands of people and asks little in return, because he sees it as his duty. It may not accord with Western liberal thinking and Mr Corbyn would not doubt disapprove, but where is the harm in it?

puja offerings at the temple
Sunday morning. David is still recovering from Everton’s loss to Arsenal in the FA Cup. Continuing to meet our craving to eat something different, we reverse yesterday’s move from Indian to European food, and swap out the toast and omelette breakfast of the last ten days for an Indian breakfast of wada, sambur, yoghurt and lassi.

Mr Ali, reliable as ever, collects us at 9am and we head to the Chamundi Hills which overlook Mysore. At the top is an old temple, still in use and absolutely heaving with people as today is Sunday and hence a day off. Mr Ali informs us that people start arriving at 5am. We decide not to join the queue, but instead wander back to the car through the numerous stalls selling trays of fruit and flowers for temple offerings and a range of cheap plastic toys and souvenirs. Next stop is yet another Nandi bull temple, and then we go to the Lalitha Palace.

This is now a hotel, and if you just read their website you’d be very tempted to stay there and enjoy the experience of staying in a palace. Sadly, this one is run by the Indian government and
Lalitha Mahal Palace faded grandeur
not the Taj group. The money available for restoration was clearly inadequate and the place presents a picture of faded grandeur, heavily scuffed around the edges. It boasts an ancient lift with an opulent sofa for important people and a grand dining room (once the ballroom). We wander upstairs and a cleaner offers to show us the Viceroy suite where, he claims, Prince Charles and Lady Diana once stayed. It costs £500/night now and definitely did not look worth it. Our 100 rupee entrance fee included a cup of coffee, so we sat in the deserted coffee lounge and were served in solitary splendour. There was no sight of even a single guest.

In the afternoon we headed for Mysore Palace, built at the start of the 20th century after the previous palace burnt down. It’s a hugely imposing building from the outside, but visiting proved a trial. We were elbowed aside brutally in the queue to buy a ticket, and even our finely honed London bus stop skills failed to solve the problem. Once in, we found it was necessary to remove our shoes and check them in. Next stop was the security gate, where we were told
Mysore palace
we could not take our cameras in. They were supposed to left by the main entrance thought there was nothing to tell us this was the case. By now we were barefoot and a fair distance from the main entrance. The security guard suggested that for 40 rupees (the fee for checking in the cameras, he assured us) we could take them in if they were in a bag. We had no bag. After much discussion, he vanished and reappeared with a small flimsy black plastic bag into which we gingerly placed our two large Canon cameras, topped by a hat. The bag was clearly not going to bear the weight of the cameras for more than 20 seconds, so Sara had to clutch it to her body, holding it from the underside.

Once in the palace, we joined a long winding queue of visitors. The main attraction is the three large durbar halls, decorated in a bizarre mix of English art deco (the architect was British) and ancient Hindi and Islamic designs. Most of the rooms had turquoise as their main colour theme, and were impressive if not exactly tasteful. In the second hall, we became aware of
Sara with another nandi
a security guard calling after us. Oh no, we thought, he’s realised we have cameras in the bag and is about to expel us or extort more money. We ignored him and marched on, pointing with feigned interest at things – anything – in the opposite direction. All was in vain as he caught up with and grabbed David’s arm. ‘Have you seen the elephants over there?’ he asked? Bewildered, we said no. 'Maharajah's personal elephants you want see I take you'. He had flagged us as foreigners with no guide, and was seeking to offer his services as a guide no doubt for an outrageous fee. We escaped.



Once out of the palace, we headed for our shoes, only to find we were required to walk all the way round the outside of the palace – still barefoot, on a very hot surface – in order to be funnelled past the elephant and camel ride options (treading carefully around the piles of camel and elephant poo, both of which are found in significant sized deposits). Nice. Finally reunited with our footwear, ignoring the abuse of the shoe man claiming money while standing in front of a sign 3ft high saying it was a free service, we relocated Mr Ali and returned to the hotel to cool down and take advantage of happy hour.

We went back to the palace this evening to see it lit up. What an amazing sight - thousands of lights strung all over the place all shining brightly. turning it into a version of Cinderella's castle.

David at Tipu Sultan's summer palace
We drive south through the rice paddies from Hassan. We ask Mr Ali to take us via Sharavanabelagola where there is a massive statue of a Jain saint on a hilltop. We arrive, gaze up at the 660 steps which you must ascend barefoot, and decide to give it a miss. The guide book suggests it’s a 2 hour round trip, barefoot up the rock which heats up. We return to the car, surrounded by aggressive hawkers and beggars clawing at us. We leave this unpleasant place.

Sringapatnam. There are many ways to spell this town, but it was the site of the famous battle in 1799 when Tipu Sultan (he who owned the famous mechanical tiger now in the V&A Museum in London) was killed by the forces of the East India Company. The story was told in one of Bernard Cornwell's “Sharpe” books and David was keen to try and identify the key sights from the book. Sadly, the British demolished most of the fort subsequent to the battle before handing the rule of Mysore state to their puppet maharajah. All that is left are some sad ruins gates and pieces of wall, overgrown and often covered with
dungeon at Sringapatam
rubbish. David did though discover the Water Gate where Sharpe supposedly killed Tipu. Mr Ali was completely puzzled by our behaviour, clearly not too many of his guests behave in this strange way. We also found the dungeon where Colonel Baillie and other British prisoners were held, some for up to fifteen years between 1784 and 1799.

There are also the remains of Tipu's summer palace, beautifully decorated inside but in need of some serious renovation, and the mausoleum that Tipu built for his father Haider Ali, where he is now buried alongside him.

Now it is time to move on the last few miles to our hotel in Mysore. After reading generally poor Tripadvisor reviews on the hotel we were booked into in Mysore, we swapped to a 4 star place in town that costs a mere £30/night. So far it is looking like a good choice – a clean room, internet in the room and a good restaurant. We’ve been away 25 days and had one European meal in the whole of that time. Today felt like the day to extend that to two, and we thoroughly enjoyed our late lunch of a club sandwich with
another day, another photo call
chips.



David has spent the last half hour trying to find an online fed of the Everton v Arsenal match, only for Sara to scroll through the multitude of channels on the satellite box and locate a channel showing the match live. His nerves are jangling, Sara is happily enjoying the chance to check the internet.

Our fan club at Halebid temple
A gentle day today, probably just as well as we were both exhausted after two days of route marching in the midday sun around Hampi. A 9am start proved to be just as well after it took 45 minutes for breakfast to arrive. Who’d think scrambled egg and toast was such a complicated order?

Belur and Halebid are about an hour’s drive away (no hotels recommended anywhere nearer). Both have 11th and 12th century temples, amongst the greatest in India, built by the Hoysala kings, with an extraordinary quantity of exquisite sculpture. Bangles on a dancer’s wrist that move, despite all being carved out of a single piece of stone, 64 elephants marching in a ground level frieze, every one different to the next, dancing girls, gods, demons, mythical beasts, pillars covered with carvings – the list goes on. Both temples were truly beautiful, but we were feeling the effect of the heat and our previous exertions. The guide seemed determined to describe every single sculpture to us, in considerably more detail than we really wanted or needed. The pace and the script were set by the guide showing round a French couple just ahead of us. It rapidly became
Belur temple
clear that every description and every poor joke was identical, while off-the-cuff questions did not get much of an answer. David was so entranced by the carvings that he kept asking subsidiary questions and took 180 photos of them, while Sara sat on a step nursing the remains of a migraine. Heavier than usual photo editing required this evening!

At Halebid, the world’s largest school party was on tour. Round about 100 small children in their neat little uniforms aged probably no more than 6 or 7 were being shown around at breakneck pace, in a long winding crocodile. We made the mistake of saying hello to one of their number who felt brave enough to accost us. Instantly they stopped their march and we were mobbed, with every remaining child wanting to greet us and shake our hands. The noise level rose to deafening proportions, while helpless teachers looked on unable to restore control. Even our guide seemed rather bemused patting one or two of them on the head. Eventually, duty done, we continued on our blow by blow tour of the temple, which features 2 huge statues of the bull Nandi on whom the god Shiva rides
Mrs Thomas has had enough.......
through all eternity. By this time, as David continued his quest for the shooting the perfect image, Sara had reverted to her repeated “er ehr” and “mm , yes” responses when we were told “this is a masterpiece of our temple madam” about yet another sculpture, while her idiot husband compounded the delay by taking yet another photo.......



Back to the hotel, even Mr Ali declared it hot today.

Chitradurga fort
Hampi to Hassan

If you are thinking of driving from Hampi to Hassan, be aware that the roads are pretty awful in places. One can see why this is a less well trodden route, most people jacking out of Karnataka at Hampi and taking the train to Goa. Not us though, we were off to see the great temples at Belur and Halebid, which necessitates this drive south. On the way we stopped at Chitradurga, to see the fort situated atop seven adjacent boulder strewn hills. The hill has seemingly been fortified for millennia and fell to Hyder Ali of Mysore in 1780 who lopped off the defeated king's head and stole all his treasure in time honoured Indian fashion. He was then succeeded by his son Tipu Sultan who further fortified the place and was in turn killed by the British at the battle of Seringapatam in 1799, of which more on a later day.

Clearly not many foreigners come here, as we had to wait five minutes as the ticket man rummaged around in his drawers to find the foreigner tickets wrapped in a dusty plastic bag. The fort walls are built of massive stone blocks pieced
Marauding macaques
together without mortar and for some reason it reminded me of the walls of Mycenae. We were trailed round continually by locals and were stopped more than once for the “please one photo” routine. All very friendly though, handshakes all round with me (not with Sara though, women don’t shake hands in India it seems). We got as high as we could in the heat as of course it was midday and sweltering, then admitted defeat and descended, trailed for a white by nasty mangy little macaque monkeys who seemed to specialise in stealing water bottles.



Back to the car, four hours bouncing over roads that were not so much pot-holed as cratered, and here we are in Hassan. Rarely has a three star hotel felt so luxurious.

Hampi stone chariot
It is difficult to convey the scale of Hampi. A city of 500,000 people, one of the great trading centres of the world in the 15 and 16th centuries, visited by merchants from England, Europe, the middle East and China. Devastated, pillaged and destroyed by vengeful Muslims from the Deccani sultanates after Talikota in 1565 (as the guide kept telling us ad nauseam), and then abandoned and overgrown by the jungle until discovered by an intrepid Englishman on his horse in the 19th century. And now a World Heritage Site, little known outside India.

Massively long and wide colonnaded market avenues lead up to temple complexes of the 14th to 16th centuries. The temples were also social centres, so you find a dining and dormitory building, a consultation hall, a music and dancing hall and an inner sanctum where the deity would be worshipped in most of the temples. The level of carving varies in quality, as does the level of iconoclasm indulged in by those vengeful Muslims.

The light is rather dead as the day is overcast so the whole impression is one of a rather grey coloured city, the building and massive boulders all around blending one
Intrepid explorer
into the other, but with the vivid greens of the paddies and the palm groves counterpointing the grey, the river meandering through adding another dimension. The whole thing feels immense, a lost civilisation recovered from the jungle.

The temperature is passing 30C and rising and our guide suggests a drift down the river in a coracle powered by a nut brown and gnarled boatman to another temple complex. A relief from a half hour walk, we take the coracle as people have done for thousands of years, past reed beds and riverside shrines, the massive boulders all around.

The magnificent Vitthala temple is one of the grandest and home of the iconic stone chariot that features on all promotional pictures of Hampi. A magnificent vehicle, frozen now but capable of movement if it is was let free. Quite unique.

It is now over 35C and time to visit the Royal Quarter, the palaces of the kings and queens, unfortunately all gone apart from their ornate stone plinths as they were all built of fragrant sandalwood and so all burnt in the sack of the city. We see the elephant stables where the royal nellies were kept, and
Temple emerging from the jungle
the queen's palace where she was attended by her vast coterie of ladies and guarded by her faithful eunuchs. Only the intrepid Brits are out in the midday sun, all ridiculously attired in one way or another and exchanging a polite “good morning” in some sort of show of solidarity in the face of adversity (etiquette has to be maintained you know).

One last photographic vista and it is back to the hippie cafe for lunch. Some quick ruthless bartering by Sara for some earrings, no pestering today by the “photo sadhus” who recognise a lost cause when they see one, an invitation from a fierce looking transvestite to enter her shop which is politely declined, assorted beggars and that man who is trying for the second day to sell us a flute on which he plays the first few bars of Titanic.

Mr Ali then takes us to his home for a cup of the strongest tea we have ever drunk, introducing us to his wife and daughter. Sara asks the teenage daughter her age, occasioning a fit of giggles and causing her to hide. The only common ground she could find with Mr Ali’s wife was
At leisure in the coracle
to note that her ewing machine was very similar to the 1952 Singer sewing machine Sara inherited from her mother. This went down very well. A small crowd gathers at the door to stare and giggle at the two overheated Englanders. We bid farewell amongst much waving and further giggles, and return to the hotel.



An amazing place seen by a route march in blazing heat that our forebears would have been proud of.

Hampi
The drive from Badami to Hampi is only about two hours. Early excitement as we track two guys on a motorbike carrying a pane of glass at right angles to the direction of travel so it acts as a great big windbreak. They nearly come off as they swerve over a speed bump, but we get bored as they seem to have the hang of it and are not going to fall off, so we tell Mr Ali to speed up. The land is fertile and the trees a mix of deciduous trees and palm trees, coconut and banana groves abound, as do fields of sugar cane and rice paddies. Gone are the fields of wheat and cotton. The temperate climbs again, as does the cloud cover. “Cool today” says Mr Ali. “Only 30, when warm 45”.

Hampi. 29sq km of abandoned 16th century city, the ancient capital of the Vijayanagar empire that was defeated in 1565 at the Battle of Talikota by a confederacy of sultanates from the Deccan to the north, after which the city was sacked for six months and then abandoned. The buildings are scattered amongst massive granite outcrops where you can still see the lava
Carrying glass on a motorbike
flows sitting where they hardened in place. Trees are lacking and in the midday heat (when inevitably we are out and about), it presents a surreal landscape, not to mention a physical challenge as we slip and slide over smooth rock slopes with our hitherto loose fitting clothes plastered to us in the heat. Sweat is salty and it’s impossible to drink enough. But it’s worth it to see the sheer magnificence of this once proud city.

It’s the first place we have encountered any Western tourists in numbers, but Hampi has clearly made it onto the hippy/gap year backpacker trail. Mr Ali deposits us at a backpacker cafe and tells us to meet him at the car park in an hour. Mr Ali knows best so we agree to do so, while probably he pops home as he lives in the next village, which is fair enough. The cafe is run by Nepalis and serves tasty food of the sort that saved our lives in Tibet where the local food was unspeakable. The young things who were hanging out in the cafe were lounging on comfortable cushions and mats on the floor, but the old people were shown
Haven't you got jobs to go to
by the waiter to a table and chairs, he correctly surmising we would not have been very comfortable on the floor. We were at least 35 years older than anyone else in there. We think that the place is a bit out of the 70s but there is no smell of weed drifting around, even the hippy types seem cleaner living these days. After splurging £3 on lunch we fill in the rest of the time by drifting round the shops selling clothing for backpackers and leather goods that will stink the place out when you get them home and realise they have not been properly cured. Fake sadhus wander around offering to have their photo taken for money. We decline.

Once reunited with Mr Ali and the blissfully air conditioned people carrier, we set off to visit sites that we will not go to with the guide tomorrow. Mr Ali’s local knowledge comes in very handy, and most of the sites we visit are deserted. Along the way we see Western tourists toiling up hills on bicycles or risking life and limb on hired motorbikes. All have bare arms and legs and no hats or head protection. Many sport alarming displays of sunburn. There will be a few cases of heatstroke tonight in the backpacker hostels.

The Vijayshree Resort.......a slightly odd place, bungalows set about 100 yards from the main building. The bungalow is in my mind what a Colonial administrator would have stayed in during the Raj while touring his area of responsibility, all a bit faded but basically OK.



We go to dinner, no alcohol here so it is lime soda tonight. Sara recoils with horror when she sees the outside dining area with low tables and people sitting on the floor flapping away the mosquitoes, but relief when we are lead to the European's dining room. Indian TV burbles on in the background, David may have to switch it off soon. Meanwhile, outside we hear the beat of drums. The hotel is, in fact, not a mere resort but a heritage village, offering a range of faux rural Indian pastimes for the Bangalore city dwellers – camel rides, dancing and goodness knows what else. They don’t have camels in Karnataka, but let's not quibble.

Badami rock temple
Strange things happen.... as we sit in the lobby/dining room of our hotel (only place with wi-fi) under the cooling breeze of a fan, a small white rabbit has just ambled past. And left, presumably not wishing to be spotted by the cooks.

Badami is famous for its rock temples, hewn and carved out of massive sandstone cliffs. For once, we don’t need the sensible hats that cause so much derision, as the temples are in shade first thing in the morning. Today we have a guide, recommended to us by our guide at Hyderabad and charging a modest £9 for three hours. There’s no doubt you see and appreciate a lot more with guide, even though yesterday we were so hot we just wanted to keep going and would not have paid attention to explanations of the nine incarnations of Vishnu etc . This guide was good, explaining the place without going into five minute lectures on Indian gods every time he showed us a different carving. The views as we gradually ascended the cliff were impressive, looking across to more cliffs and giant boulders, and down to the man made lake (tank) built in the sixth century to
Market in Badami
provide a water supply but now sadly too polluted to be drunk. Instead, a man was washing his ox, and some women were scrubbing rugs, laid out to dry on the steps.

We stopped off in the market to buy some more oranges (emergency lunch supply of fruit and biscuits is always a good idea in case there is nowhere obvious for lunch). From time to time the sheer overwhelming combination of noise, smells, bustle and apparent chaos can be slightly overwhelming. You realise you cannot hear anything other than a background deafening roar, and in a place like this where there are far more Europeans you do not get noticed so much, so you can sort of drift through in a slightly disembodied way. Overlapping images of piles of vegetables, fruit, spices, plastic tat, food stalls, rubbish, rummaging black pigs, and the occasional monkey trying to steal things and being chased off by a stick wielding store holder fill your vision. And all the time that din and the heat beating down on you as the clothes stick to your back and you seek out the shade.

Finally we climb up to one last temple, past a
baby bunny
group of children seemingly mixing cement for some unknown use. The gardener followed us up and opened the temple for us. It’s still in use and he told us he goes every morning to make his puja. He asked anxiously what we thought of the gardens, and beamed when we admired them.

Back to the hotel for a much needed shower and lunch, followed by a relaxing afternoon reading and sorting photos. We're staying at the Krishna Heritage hotel and it is a wonderful oasis of calm, with great service. The mystery of the white rabbit resolved itself when the manager appeared clutching two tiny brown rabbits by the scruff of their necks and proceeded to feed them milk. He explained that they are wild orphans which he is bringing up, but the white rabbit is one he has boiled ..... no, we misheard, one he has bought as a pet and not for the pot.

dual carriageway lane discipline
The day breaks in dusty disgusting Bijapur. I awake and contemplate the brown smears on the bedroom wall.....just what is that substance? Best not to think, get up shower, and give thanks that the bowels have held up after last night's delicious dinner – 1.5l of beer, 8 biscuits (cost 10p per packet) and six bananas. We could not face the food bizarre downstairs. We had tried room service; a man appeared with a grease stained menu card. “Is not our menu is someone else's, food not same prices not same but maybe similar”. Excellent salesmanship you will agree. We gave up at that point and took comfort in beer.

By 8am we are packed and ready to flee but Mr Ali the driver does not start till 830am. But at 825am we espy him and run to the car, flinging our cases in. The management do not even bother to check us out, and fortunately for them they did not ask us if we had enjoyed a pleasant stay or we would have unburdened ourselves.

Off we roll across more miles of God's ironing board, the Deccan plateau. The road is a good four lane highway and we
Pattadakal temples
make excellent time. We practise that well known Indian custom of driving the wrong way down the dual carriageway when Mr Ali needs some fuel on the other side of the road. Add that one to the CV.

Aihole (pronounced “Ay –ho – lay,” sorry to disappoint) is a cluster of temples built from the 5th to the 8th centuries. Crumbling sandstone, but very evocative and with some beautiful carvings. In one place the temples are actually in a village, with houses and temples cheek by jowl. Pattadakal, a few miles on, is more sanitised as it is a World Heritage site, so better maintained. The villagers there were relocated. By the time we arrive the temperature has soared to well over 30C, and of course we are out in the midday sun as we are British, and that is what we do. We are grateful for the chance periodically to shelter inside the temples. For some reason, David's stylish hat occasions great mirth amongst a group of young Indian ladies. No idea why........our last stop is a Hindu temple complex out of town, clearly a Nandi shrine, as stone bulls are everywhere. The smell of incense hangs heavy
Playing in the 6th century water tank
in the air. There is an ancient water tank, full of dozens of boys and youths messing about and shouting. We get a lot of stares here, as if we have stumbled into a world where we do not belong.



At last we reach out next hotel, a calm oasis in the countryside that is clean, spacious and welcoming. We settle gratefully onto our balcony, whilst keeping an eye open for the monkeys we are told will enter our rooms unbidden if given the chance, and just steal whatever they can lay their hands on......makes a change though doesn't it?

School children
This morning we leave the colorful state of Rajasthan for Agra and our visit to the Taj Majal. Our stop last night was just to shorten the drive to Agra and the hotel didnt come close to the ""castle"" if the previous two nights. We were just happy to get here since the bus broke down about 15 miles from the hotel. Fortunately there was another OAT group ahead of us and they were able to send a bus to retrieve us from the side of the road! The road we were driving on was by far the best we have seen so far--- a two lane divided highway that was reasonably well paved. There were still crazy drivers, tractors, overloaded carts as well as cows on the roads. The rides continue to be entertaining!

Yesterday began with a visit to a school. I was afraid we wouldn't get to see many children since it was Sunday, but the word spread quickly through the village that the were there and at least 40 children showed up as soon as we arrived. I led the group in ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" which they clearly had heard before. Others in our
Village Children
group then came forward to lead other songs before we broke into smaller groups for a spontaneous ""lesson"". This school is a ""private"" school which receives some support from the Grand circle Foundation (OAT parent company) so it had some ""luxuries"" such as bathrooms and nicely painted walls. More significantly, the teachers all have college degrees which is not true in the government schools. It was still hard to imagine 200 students and 9 teachers in the space we saw.

We next walked through the village and ended at a home where we had tea and had a chance to take to the Family. This particular family owned a fair amount of land which had been divided among 3 brothers. When a man marries, his wife comes to live in his home with her husband and in-laws. 80% of the marriages in India are arranged. Only in the large cities are ""love marriages"" becoming more common---though even there they are clearly the exception.

Our final stop was at a cooperative where women (and some men) are trained to make handicrafts to sell. The program was started to help people who had previously made a living from poaching in
Women's Cooperative
the Rathambore Park before poaching was outlawed. The woman who started the cooperative had been a tourist from Bangalore man

Things are changing for women somewhat in India. More and more girls are going to school even in the rural areas. Boys are still highly valued in the family. I found it interesting that it is ilegal to find out the sex of the child before it is born. After the introduction of sonograms, there was a large number of abortions of girl babies. Finally there was a recognition that the sex ratio was was off balance and there were not going to be enough girls for all the men! A doctor can lose his license and face criminal charges if it is proven that he/she revealed the sex of a child to the parents.

The bus is about to leave. Tomorrow the Taj Majal!

Last view of Varkala beach. It was a bit old hippie. But they were harmless and I liked them.
Right, a bit of a preamble: I actually wrote the bulk of this about two weeks ago, and had thought about rewriting it, but decided to leave it the same but add some postscript so this text and the pictures might be a bit disjointed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello everyone, as always I hope you are all well.

A fairly short entry this time round, not to say that stuff hasn’t happened, because it has, but it is just not quite as much stuff as on previous posts.

Or, let me flip that a bit. I have been suspecting for sometime that things that would have filled me with novelty on the previous trip are now pretty much matter of course and so I don’t report on them. I remember on my last trip I would report on things such as frogs in toilets, cows on the streets, the laughable driving, regular power cuts. Things that would intrigue and entertain me have slowly become…..normal.

I must try and reverse this as many of the readers of this current blog were not readers before, so I must make more of an effort to capture these things that define a

good old fashioned developing country. But please don’t think that I am taking anything for granted I am not, I am deeply appreciative of my current lifestyle.

Does that make sense? I hope so.

But. To complicate things a bit further, I also suspect that I have not really been off the beaten track that much since coming to India. The funny thing about the beaten track is that when you are off it you wish you were on it, and, many times, when you are off it you wish you are on it again. Like all things in life it is all about balance.

Anywoo. So. Last time I left you in Varkala. I liked that town. Which I why I stayed for two weeks. But I did finally leave to head to Cochin to meet a friend called Zane. I met Zane on the Turkey to Iran train (you always meet the best people on trains, especially in remote areas). It turned out Zane was going to be in the North of India, I was going to be in the South, so we decided to meet up half way.

I really enjoyed my time

Every house or shop has a little shrine area.
with him, he is interested in stuff, I am interested in stuff, so we had much stuff in common. I have a natural fear and suspicion of technology, he on the other hand embraced technology as an aid that can enhance life. I spent much time warning him that the satellites could fall from the sky and the Internet could breakdown whilst happily following his GPS I Phone and using his various apps to help me identify various onward travel options.

He had to carry on down South to meet up with a tech company developing a gravity light (Google it) and I had to make up South to Goa, Via Mangalore, to meet with another traveling partner.

I met a lass called Neriman when working on the farm in Turkey and I got an E mail about a month ago to say she was heading to India so we decided to meet up in Goa.

Not quite sure where we will go but that is fine. India is that sort of place, just play it by ear. She has some friends who live up in the North of Goa so I think we will head there

at some point. Not sure how long we will travel together, it is very hard to know these things.

So……I am enjoying India, but I am conscious I am yet to see the “real” India. I have had to deal with a few beggars, seen a small amount of public street defecation but I continue to be reminded that Kerala and Goa are not really the real India. Fear not peeps, I will…….I will.

Oh, I also meant to say that the great thing about India is that you can get off the beaten track just by catching a bus twenty minutes in any direction. You don’t need to go to the disputed territory of Kashmir or the lawless bandit country of Mizoram to get away from Westerners, just catch a bus to a town that is not mentioned in the Lonely Planet. Oh don’t get me started on the Lonely Planet…..maybe that is a rant for another time….

All my love.

Ok, so now for the postscript..

So, met with Neriman and had lots of fun in Goa but I have decided I can’t spend any more time on the
IMG_0813

coastal beach places, six weeks is just about my limit. I cannot believe I am saying this but….I am bored of beaches.

I can now walk in any beach restaurant in Kerala, Goa or Karnataka and recite the menu without even looking. If I hear another Bongo drum I am going to cry. If someone tries to sell me another trinket they may end up in Hospital. After so many weeks in Beach Huts I am getting desperate for a change of scenery.

Neriman however is just at the start of her trip so these places hold the same appeal as they did for me when I arrived (remember the “life is a beach” comments, the endless photos of palm trees?). India holds so much interesting places I am at a point where I want to and explore a bit more.

I loves a good beach I do, but like all things in life you need a balance. We plan to meet up again later in the adventure because she is a jolly good lass and a fun traveling partner.

So, I decided to catch the 15 hour over night train (vomit) from Gokarna

to Mysore as an attempt to break away from the coast. Blimey India is big. Google map Gokarna, then Google map Mysore. Ask yourself how it takes 15 hours. It looks like a quick jaunt up the road, but it isn’t.

I am also at the point where I need a break from the heat so I am going to try and find some hills soon. I want to stop sweating.

Those pesky North East States still seem to be calling me….But what folk don’t understand is that at the moment the North of India is very cold. And I mean very cold, so maybe these will have to wait until later on. But, I have a decent Interweb connection in my new place so I can spend some much needed time looking at the logistics of a trip up there.

So, there we are, a wee update. I really hope that the terrible weather you Brits are being subjected too isn’t getting you down. I have just seen the news for the first time in ages and it looks mighty bad.

I know that this has almost become a standard issue statement but I am

These are the famous Chinese fishing nets of Kochin. They don't seem to be catching very much fish. Maybe the fish ate the rubbish and all died.
sorry if I haven’t replied to any messages, with this superfast Internet connection I hope to make amends.

All my love

Hampi
Oh all we ever seem to do is catch a train. I am sure by now you guys are all trained out. I really like train travel and its all so comfortable and well organized. We met a couple in our compartment the husband lectures in tool and dye cutting and she is a professor of engineering/ they had recently been to South Africa so we had lots to talk about. Every youngster we speak to is studying engineering of some sort there is a glut of engineers here and so they in the end take on crappy jobs just to get a job often not even in their own field. And we have the problem in South Africa that we only have one place in Durban where they teach Tool and Dye cutting and that is a huge problem for us as we have to import all the tools we need and no one able to repair them. Very short sighted of our government to close those colleges.

Our meet and great rickshaw was waiting for us that is the first time I have ever had that service in India. We didn’t have to deal with the touts what
getting water
a pleasure Thanks Padma Guest house. First we had to try and confirm our onward journey as we were wait listed. We had moved up the ranks and were told we were now number 5 and 6 on the list but don’t worry we will definitely be on. Better had otherwise it might mean we would have to suffer a 10 hour bus drive and Terry would not like that at all and me too trains are so civilised.You can never go hungry or thirsty on a train journey. all the time you hear a food wallah coming up and down the corridor singing what they sell Chaaaaaai or lassi lassi, cooldrinks.,pani water then food calls biriyani, bajias of some kind or another.



We drove past a few villages up some hillocks and down into little vallies. Then a few ruined temples and then more and more until at last over the last hill and we had arrived at Hampi. It had a big dusty bus station – by this I mean an area where busses stopped nothing formal, with the cutest cart shops selling chai and fried snacks (always lots of fried stuff) like chillies in
lemonade seller
a bhaji batter that are quite nice once in awhile, and then a couple of rows of carts selling tourist stuff. Hampi is a very special place for locals to come on pilgrimage so its always busy.. On the opposite side there was a post office, school and a few guest houses where’s ours was. It was very nice basic but clean. We had breakfast muesli of a crude but tasty home made kind with big chunks of roasted coconut pieces, curd yoghurt ,honey and fruit (tourism city) then it was out to explore the town and we made arrangements for rickshaw driver for the afternoon to do some temple visits. The main section of the town was down the road closer to the river. The streets were mostly dusty and unpaved old houses all now converted into restaurants,guest houses, money changers, shops selling everything from clothes to leather goods and jewelry and of course bakeries selling western style munchies.A good money making venture by 3 older guys is to dress up in traditional clothes say you are a magic man and get photos taken for a hundred rupees. Good wicket guys!!! the only other thing that disturbs the peace
roof top restaurant
Bob Marley alive and well and played in every roof top restaurant
is an occasional steal of bananas by a cow might start a rumpus with the banana wallah.

We only did the free temples in the afternoon set over many miles its almost like Bagan with the multitude of buildings though very different style and of course religion. In many ways Anchor Wat is closer in religious terms. It was hot and dusty and thankfully we had our trusty rickshaw waiting for us after each temple visit. For sunset we were taken to a lovely spot on the hill where priests were chanting the Ramayana 24/7 there is never a break they never stop there are always 2 priests taking it in turns oh and using a microphone so its loud even if no one is there. Besides monkeys and dogs there were some beautiful wild vivid green parrots flying around and our guide said this is the only temple where they hang out and for sure they were the only ones we saw during our stay. The whole area is full of balancing rocks. Its like there was one huge explosion which I am sure there was and huge boulders of rocks were thrown into the atmosphere and then
the magic men
came and landed here some of them balancing in the most precarious way. In fact some of the temples too are balancing in a very precious manner too. The sunset did not disappoint either except for the few too many other people who came as well. Well not hectically but one always wants mostly solitude at these moments.



We knew exactly where we wanted to go for dinner as the word had it they sold special Lassi’s and the word was not wrong. Walking around the village after dinner was incredibly special. There is a special peacefulness amongst the mingling of cows, dogs, monkeys and people all in a very unhurried manner that is far away from the big cities. Tourism sure has changed this valley forever but not in a bad way at all. There is no alcohol so that for sure is a big factor. During the day there are many many local tourists who come to make puja. I was up before sunrise the chai shops were already crancking up so of course I had one to start the morning. Then I followed a bus load of pilgrims down to the river to watch
view
them bath and do their morning rituals. After bathing its off to the Temple.

All the women were wearing fresh flowers in their hair and everyone with fresh bhindi’s on their foreheads. As it was Republic Day the school children were all dressed up in clean uniforms, flag stickers pasted to their cheeks a few had flags. The school was being bedecked with banana fronds the main flag waiting to be unfurled. We could hear them from our guesthouse later singing and saying what I suspect were poems or stories. Everything is always done with microphones and on loud. That is the Indian way.

Terry had hung his bananas in a packet from the burglar bars in our room. The next thing we noticed they had gone. It must have been a monkey who came past and smelt them, broke the fly screen and stole them – would so have loved to have seen him in action the bugger so smart and as Terry says something he will never do again. The pay for Temples were more special of course and one building t that I really liked was a stable for the Kings elephants which I think
pretty green parrott
was one of the most beautiful. The roof was domed with about 9 domes and 3 different patterns of domes. The insides were decorated in stucco.The elephants had a view out of big doors ways that are now open. they could have been closed originally with wooden doors now long gone. Small openings for people to get through. The walls around this building were amazing all put together without mortice and reminded me so much of my travels to Cusco with Toni. How did they do it without the sophisticated tools we have today?



You stand amongst the ruins of passageways where shops once were, where a whole community lived, ate and prayed and one can only try and imagine the splendor which is nothing now compared to what it was.Yet so splendid in what remains.

We packed early and went for a last dinner and walk about this lovely town it would be a very early call the next morning 5 am departure as I am nervous and we needed to confirm we were on the train. So it was good bye Hampi and I am so glad we came - I loved this place
Post box
and off to Goa.

girls selling chili at the Devaraja Market
.....this is what lonely planet says about Mysore. Well, we are not really LP-fans - but this is certainly true. Mysore has everything South India is made of: tempels, pujas, lovely food, hot weather, friendly people, colonial buildings, honking, crazy markets, yoga, all kinds of smells and colours and, a highlight for us (after a long time without): nice cold local beer. This city is a feast for all sins. But come prepared and be ready to dive into this world - otherwise it will makes you crazy.

We were thinking a lot about going to Mysore. The last travelblogs about this city were not really enthusiastic. But in Wayanad, we spoke to so many people who simply loved their time in Mysore that we finally decided to check it out. And did we regret coming there? Of course not - we loved it and could have stayed much longer. It is crazy, it is stressful, colourful, mindblowing - I have no more english words to describe this city. But may be it is not my limited knowledge of english. You must experience this city, there are no words to describe it, no matter in which language. Well, at least
Mysore Palace on Sunday nights
Stunning!
I will try to write a bit about what we did.

First of all we were very lucky with where we stayed. As it was weekend, all the popular places had already been booked. Beena, our angel from Wayanad, found a cheap homestay for us a bit out of town: the Rooftop Retreat. We did not get this fantastatic rooftop apartment which is really a great deal for only 2.000 rupia. We had a very small but superclean room downstairs for only 1.000 rupia including free water and indian breakfast.The owners were very nice and helpful and with the ricksaw it is just a short ride to town. First of all we just walked around the center and got the real Mysore feeling by slowly walking through the Devaraja Market. What a wonderfully bustling bazaar full of traders selling traditional items such as flower garlands, spices and conical piles of kumkum. Of course there is also the typical tourist stuff - but you have to bargain hard. On our first visit we did not buy anything but took it just all in. Outside the market we found a music store and decided to buy some traditional music. We were
offerings for a puja
just standing inside listening to a CD when a cow walked passed and put her head into the store looking at us. This was so surreal for us (for the locals it must have been normal) - it was a good combination of the modern world and the tradition Mysore is made of. We had lunch at the travellers' famous Parklane Hotel which was nice, especially the cold beer. Since New Year we had not had anything else than water and tea (just because beer was not available), what a nice taste of the first sip! The next morning after a delicious homecooked breakfast at our homestay we went up to Chamundi Hill. This is one of the 8 most sacred hills in South India and there were some celebrations going on that day. So it was packed with people and, of course, cows. We made our way to the main entrance. Before entering the palace, we got a blessing and then could quickly walk through the tempel receiving a Darshan and another blessing inside. It was amazing to see how all this people were quickly led through the tempel, all receiving their darshans and blessings. An amazing experience and
Nina being blessed
we were really happy that we already know the meanings and rules of how to behave and what to do on such an occasion. Afterwards we descided to walk down the 1000 steps back to town. After halfway, you can see a big statue of Nandi, Shiva's vehicle. Back in town it was time for a late lunch before we did some big shopping which was good fun and we made some really good deals concerning clothes. Walking through the streets suddenly someone called our names. We turned around in surprise - well, the street was packed with locals, who is knowing us here anyway? A french couple we met in Wayanad was standing behind us. Funny. We would not have found us if we had tried to. But these guys were not the only ones we met....

The next day, sunday, we were ready for the Mysore highlight: a visit to the Palace. From outside, this palace really is spectacular. Around town there are more wonderful, colonial buildings giving the city a certain grandeur. But this palace really left us speechless (which is so difficult, as we both love talking ;-)). We entered the gardens and first visited
Nagarhole National Park
Can you spot the elefant we saw on our way from Wayanad to Mysore?
an old Vishnu Tempel which was also very beautiful and overall peaceful. As there are no photographys allowed inside the palace we first walked around the gardens taking some pics. In one shady corner of the park we saw some elefants. As Markus loves those animals, we went there. We got some elefant blessings (the elefant put his trunk on our heads and gave us a big blow with some awfully warm air). Finally, we could also sit on the elefant. We gave the guys a few rupia for this. Later we discovered that this was a real bargain for us. Even local tourists pay nearly the double price to sit on the elefant. How lucky we had been!

Of course, we also visited the palace. It was again packed with people and many school classes. But it was really beautiful with some amazing architectural details. We loved the detailed wood carvings with marble. And suddenly, just in front of us, were our friends from Belgium - the family we had met in Kannur a couple of days earlier. Spontanously, we had lunch together and spent the rest of the afternoon walking around town to some sandalwood shops and
indian breakfast @ Rooftop Retreat Homestay
also trying all the famous sweets in coffee shops. That was good fun and it was great to see you guys again - have a safe ongoing trip!

We ended our time in Mysore with one more highlight - a visit to the palace in the dark when it was illuminated by around 100.000 light bulbs. It was stunning! We felt like in Disneyland. The whole atmosphere was breathtaking. There, again, were many people, but all were happy and peaceful and we simply had a great time taking this all in. What a better way than ending a perfect day with a nice dinner on a roof top terrace at Gandhi Square.

Much too fast our time in Mysore was over. We had not expected to enjoy an indian city that much. Still there are a lot more things to see and do. But we decided to move on anyway. Our time is limited and some more interesting destinations are waiting for us. A bus was taking us up into the mountains again - over 2.000 meters into the heart of the Nilgiris.

Our next stop: the chilly and strange hill station of Ooty.


they collect the garbage in some areas of Mysore....
...but surely not in all...

We were in Mysore, 3 hours southeast of Bangalore, on our way to the government silk factory, when 3 cows across the street caught my attention. After 3 months in India, I usually don't notice cows anymore. We've seen cows in the city, cows standing on a thin grassy median surrounded by relentless Indian traffic, cows on the beach, cows on the train station platform, cows in restaurants, cows in temples. Big cows, little cows, camel cows, cows with painted horns adorned like an Indian bus, sleeping cows, walking cows, stampeding cows, frisky cows, even self-pleasuring cows (seriously). I usually don't give them a second glance.



But these cows were yellow!

I don't know why they're yellow, or how they're yellow. All the white spots on the cows we saw in Mysore were dyed yellow.

There was a tree blooming with yellow flowers, and we thought that might have been used to dye the cows' white hair. But we're not really sure.

We were in Mysore during the last week of January. There there were no festivals we knew of going on that week. But in India, there are always festivals and holidays of various religions and cultures that we often know nothing about.

Why were all the cows yellow?

Palace in Mysore
The road down the mountain towards Mysore was rough and rugged but travelled through National reserves so we were entertained with flocks of pretty spotted deer, a baby elephant being washed in a stream and a group of very cute black faced monkeys who had decided to come down to the road to watch the humans and play a game of chicken on the road. They observed us as much as we observed them. The road became much better once we hit the flats and we motored quickly to Mysore, pausing once to admire the pelican elegantly fishing in a lake and a group of pelicans nesting up in the trees. Once we arrived in Mysore we headed directly to the palace. The place was teeming with tourists and we learned from Antony that it was the 'number one' palace in India, and second most popular tourist attraction after the Taj Mahal. We were not allowed to take photographs and in fact could not even take a camera inside. The bag screening indicated that Sue had a camera and security were insisting that she take it to security until a guard called Roy over and said that it was okay and she could keep her camera but not take photographs for a tip. Roy handed over the hundred rupees explaining to the guard that this was a bribe/ not a tip - the guard was happy whatever the language, Sue was happy that she kept her camera, so we popped off our shoes and headed in. Firstly we got herded into a line by a very officious elderly gent with a stick which he banged on the floor, banged in the pole and waved at us yelling and gesturing to us in Indian. It was quite strange to be treated like cattle but also very funny. We were basically herded through the entire place in a long snake of tourists which was okay except if you needed to go through a door and these became very claustrophobic as everyone tried to jump the queue. The palace was spectacular and is the official residence of the Wodeyars, the royal family of Mysore who ruled for over seven centuries. I have put in a link as we had very little information about it and became quite interested. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore_PalaceAnother 5 star dinner- to bed.

We have a rental space!

Anusha's family have agreed to rent us a room they own at only 1200 rupees per month (about AUD$24). This is a fantastic achievement given that the rent in the village is usually over 2000 rupees per month.

For two months we will occupy a smaller room on the top floor of their house, until the current tenant of the larger room moves out. The larger room is a separate dwelling on their property, with an attached bathroom.

We are all thrilled about this.

On the facilitator front, we have one great candidate named Apoorva. She is about to start her Masters in Science, and has a fantastic grasp on English. Her father is also very supportive, we just hope she will be able to fit Pod into her busy schedule!

I'm loving all your comments and feedback, so please keep them coming!

Breakfast at Oberoi
We are still swanning around in luxury; lovely Thai dinner last night, pedicures, swimming in the pool, sitting enjoying a drink at the al fresco bar and delicious complimentary breakfast. The staff are just lovely and did I mention the beds? Goose down pillows and duvets, crisp clean sheets and thick luxury towels- oh so mmmmmmmm.... We did however tear ourselves away to go sightseeing this morning and then some last minute shopping. Bangalore is ( according to the guide) the largest city in India with a population of close to 2 million. It is much cleaner and much more modern than other cities we have visited. We visited the Hindu Shiv Temple and had a quite different experience from what we expected. Firstly we dropped 108 silver coins on a snakelike walk through 108 bronze urns then we tied off our red thread to leave all our problems behind. We then started on a 'symbolic pilgrimage' through narrow tunnels that housed copies of holy shrines from other parts of India. We burned incense, threw a coin into the water ( wishing well) floated a candle and poured a milky substance over a stone. These all had significant meaning and we
Pouring milk over the holy stone at the Shiv Temple
were given a pamphlet about it as we left. The towering four armed elephant idol and huge Shiv idol were impressive though the polystyrene Himalayas background was a bit odd. From here we headed to the Bangalore Palace, which was built after the Tudor style and looked amazingly English from the outside. Inside we donned audio guides and started our tour, walking up the rosewood staircase, passing under the huge trophy elephants head shot by the present maharajah's father. There were fascinating insights into royal life and the palace held a real charm as well as architectural interest. The internal gardens and womens quarters were lovely. There were many photographs of grizzly hunts of magnificent tigers, elephants and other game animals. Underneath the photographs were grizzly elephant feet stools and one stool where the four legs were of some poor beast- a bit gruesome really. Apparently he saw the light in the early 1900s and now all these animals are protected.

Shopping was great and it was back to the lap of luxury!!!!

We got up to head to our final Indian destination- Bangalore. On the way we visited a summer palace. It was gorgeous, still original, fading and pitted in parts but still lovely. It was much smaller and housed a lot of history; finely worked aquatints from the 18 the century, a number of portraits of the ruling family by Thomas Hickey. These were very simple but expressive and sympathetic to the individuals. Weaponry, fresco paintings and explanations gave the history of the battles against the British. We arrived in Bangalore at our hotel. It was grotty!! That was it, we decided we would like a decent hotel before we left India so we talked to a local who recommended the Oberoi. We packed our bags back into the van ( much to the consternation of the hotel owner) and arrived at the Five star Oberoi-Bangalore. Oh luxury! It is divine. We spent the rest of the day here. The credit cards are getting loaded but we decided we needed a treat.

Chamundeshwari temple
15 Jan: Masinagudi to Mysore

Alarm went off at about 0600 for all in the room. This was probably a bit of a relief as the bed was hard and we were fully rested. We joined a guide, 2 others and Anne from the group on a bird watching tour. We walked around the 17 acre property and saw:

· Drangoes (or drongoes?)

· Shrikes

· A pair of malibar horn bills

· A crested eagle hawk

· 2 owlets

· Tracks of a mongoose

· Evidence of a slothbear breaking down a termite nest

· And elephant poo

We also saw painted cattle for the first time. Back to the retreat for a hearty breakfast. We settled our bills and the various tips and got back into the minibus headed toward Mysore. We followed the same rounds as we dead for the safari the previous bight, narrow with steep drop away edges. We passed through 3 national parks and spotted langurs, wild boar, macaques, spotted deer and unfortunately no elephants. The parks were quite clean and clearly actively managed. A buffer zone of at least 50m was created between
Worshipper
the road and the low vegetation around. We saw a family of langurs literally hanging around the tress, watching the passing parade of cars. One group of tourists were cycling through the park! The plains became more fertile as we approached Mysore. One the outskirts we drove up a mountain to see the Chamundeshwari temple right on the top. Dry landscape dotted with gum tress. Pilgrims dressed in black swarmed over the temple site. Catherine and I were each shooting off.

Down towards Mysore on the other side of the mountain we had a good overview of historical Mysore. We stopped to see a huge bull statue – the vehicle of Shiva. Young boys were dressed as characters from the great Hindu books. There was the monkey king, with a painted face and large lips. Local fruit stalls are plentiful, it’s a pity we cat enjoy them.

Towards the bottom of the hill we went past cattle that had been dyed yellow with turmeric, as part of a festival. These subsequently appear all over Mysore. Mysore seemed clean and quite regal, perhaps a university town. We drive past the palace and some upmarket department stores. We got to
Family group visiting the temple
our hotel at about 1530, so Catherine and I grabbed what we could for lunch. We ended up sharing a thick dip like puree of spinach and lentils, topped with melted cheese.

Elise told us, through facebook, that she was looking for an apartment in Udaipur for the girls to share. Anne (who teaches at a Steiner school), wanted to buy cheap saris for all 15 girls in her class. Catherine, Kathleen, Vicki, Roger and I joined her. It was at a government store, so the price was fixed. But none the less there were hundreds of options to sort through. 15 beautiful saris were purchased for the girls, as well as one for Anne to make a dress for her son’s wedding in Mexico next year. When we finished it was after dark. There was some difficulty in connecting with the other half of the group who had been to the markets. Several loops of Mysore CBD, and frantic phone calls before we connected again.

Well and truly dark by this time, so we were able to visit the palace which was lit up spectacularly as part of the festival. We wandered through and captured what we
Temple crowd
could using our fantastic Leica. The group then went to a beer garden restaurant with many tourists and a standard indian ensemble playing. I was struck the incredible diversity of western styles on show, with a couple of punks sitting just near us.

I was feeling a bit tentative about food, so I had a mushroom machali. I also tried another form of bread called kalcha, which was completely dry. I discussed with DJ the differences between chapartis, roti, naen and kalcha. This amount of curry and bread worked well. Catherine had a mocktail of mango, as well as her first butter chicken of the trip. The group was completely exhausted by 2130, so we headed home. DJ, our guide, told me about his experiences as a guide and how on occasion, tour companies black ban difficult clients.

16 Jan

I fronted for an ordinary breakfast of bread, jam and pawpaw. We were to visit a temple outside Mysore during the morning: Kesheva temple at Somnathapur. There was a local guide in our minibus by the time we all gathered.

The temple was about 50 minutes out of town through wonderfully lush farm land. We saw
Women purchasing flower offerings
rive, vegetables sugar cane. The cattle are decorated with different colours here, with streamers and glitter coming off their horns In the Mysore paper that morning, I saw photographs of cattle and people jumping through fire – all coloured with turmeric. This was all part of the festival. The temple itself had features like AngorWat. It was a monument to Vishnu. The guide was excellent telling us about the interpretations of the images and icons.

· Brahma

· Sawadee

· Vishnu

· Lakshmi

· Shiva

· Parvarti

The guide showed us some of the features that are mnemonic. Three showing faces of Brahma plus a beard, Havati has a book and an instrument, gods can have as many as 36 arms: mortals only 2. Some exquisite carvings of daily life and the great battles of the religious texts. Many of the small statues have been distributed around the world. Beautiful tress in the actively renovated garden. I particularly noticed the rain tree (Albizia).

We then went back to Mysore and directly to the palace. We embarked on a palace tour with a guide, who really put on a pantomime. There was a
Selling the offerings
spectacular hall for royal weddings. Paintings dating to the early 1900’s, where eyes seamed to follow you no matter where you stood. The palace was packed with Indians, around this festival day. Spectacular statues of jaguars guarded the palace. The whole thing was paid for by taxes from peasants and rajas. The tiles came from England, stained glass from Glasgow. After the tour I was able to return to the plaza area we had photographed the night before. Lunch was again at a small public eatery, where 35 RPS (about 75c), bought roti and several masalas. I got back to the hotel on the back of a small motor bike with the palace guide. Held on tight! I blogged in the room until we left for dinner at the house of a Muslim family near the station. A simple 3 room attached house. The table for 13 swapped it. The father was a friendly ‘Tevier’ type of character. Long suffering wife was definitely happy to have both daughters married and 3 grand children. One of the daughters had moved home: the custom is for the daughter to move from her husband’s family home back to her parents 3 months before
Children everywhere
the birth of a child and stays for 3 months after the birth. House had simple décor and heated floor – perhaps not intentional.

They served a lovely bhiriani of chicken and nuts. Wonderful for delicate stomachs, not too much ghee.Also an eggplant sambal and cucumber raita. Talk was free and our host was very engaging. Desert was golabjaman and custard. Entertainment was a copy of the wedding album. Bride and groom not smiling.High gloss paper.Only 450 guests. One grandchild ‘helped’ Andrea read through the book several times. The other daughter’s wedding had 4,500 guests as the husband was a ‘big’ business man. We then left for the station.
DJ told us that he is always stressed when getting onto night trains. Criminals target tourists who are dealing with all the chaos, and obviously tour groups get caught up in it. We gathered just beside our tour bus and covered each other’s backs. The train we were after was on the first platform and the carriage not too far away. Of course the carriages were dirty and not very inviting. Nonetheless the insides are clear enough. We were sharing our compartment with four of the other travellers. We got

Catherine onto the top bunk and she immediately went to sleep. Gradually the other five found their respective bunks. Big backpacks were secured under the bottom bunk and there was not much extra space. The train started on time and lights-out was at about 2230.

Street side fruit and veg
3.2.2016 DELHI TO MANDAWA

After taking 2 hours to get out of Delhi – it was then another 7 hours along bumpy, dusty and narrow roads a lot of the way until we reached Mandawa, dodging cows, camels, donkeys, goats and horses and also cars – thought we could have had at least 10 headons today but they seem to just get off the edge of the road in time. Stopped enroute for lunch at a wayside place, then continued on through the countryside, it was quite lush and green and some irrigation just outside Delhi but the further we went the dryer and dustier it became – lots of fun and interesting sights along the way – acres and acres of mustard we could see from the bus windows and people working in the fields. Mandawa!!! That was worth waiting for – the absolutely beautiful havelis were amazing to say the least with all the fresco work and tiling. (the havelis were built by very rich people on the silk route, as they were not allowed to build palaces, as palaces were just for royals, but these mansions are just massive and fitted out with everything – nearly 200
DELHI TO MANDAWA
Barber shop Indian style
years ago they all left to do business elsewhere and the staff took them over and just lived in them with their families and didn’t really keep any maintenance going). India is trying to get these heritage listed – UNESCO – as they are such a unique thing in this part of India. We were absolutely blown away with the beauty of them – got to see a lot from the outside and then were able to tour through the whole of one. Some have been taken over by locals and being bastardized – which is such a shame but hopefully they will get help to restore them – then I guess they will become a huge tourist attraction. Then onto our fantastic hotel Viveen Culture Hotel about 10kmls outside Mandawa in a small village – it is a huge old mansion/haveli that has been restored into a hotel and been operating for 4 years. If these walls could talk!!! We had the most gorgeous and unique room – the roof and walls of our room/s were painted so beautifully – we had a huge bathroom with all the mod cons and an office area with a large desk and
MANDAWA
Farmer carting hay
spot for our suitcases – this was truly an amazing hotel/building – would have loved to stay a bit longer. We took an early morning walk with our guide who took us on a walk around the village – I must say the Indian people have all been so friendly it is unbelievable – Braham took us to two family compounds – this is not on the tourist map – but just families he has got to meet and he was able to take us there to experience their way of life – we thoroughly enjoyed this experience – this is what I like to see on these sort of trips. Everyone in the whole family came out to greet us and show us around – we all felt very humble and appreciated their friendliness and openness to show us all about their lives.

4.2.2016 MANDAWA TO PUSHKAR
More dusty, bumpy roads and another 8 hours driving – heading more towards Pushkar lots more camels on the road and a lot more trucks. Got stuck at two or three level crossings for at least ½ hour each time – everyone just overtakes each other to make three lanes from
MANDAWA
Lunch stop - these little munchkins!
a one lane at the crossing – so when the train eventually passes no one can go anywhere!!! Eventually it sorts itself out and finally we get on our way. Braham made an unscheduled stop today at a school – the kids were so excited and we got to see them say their prayers and sing the National Anthem before school – was a great experience. Likewise when we pulled the bus up and he stopped a car all decorated to the hilt and asked the groom to be if he could get out of the car so we could get some snaps – poor guy hope he wasn’t late for his wedding and stopping with him were about 6 cars and a bus full of people all waving and yelling out having a great time.
Staying at Aaram Bough Hotel in Pushkar, a bit out of town, all I can say it would have been very grand in its day, its theme has been built from all the ancient countries, Persia, Egypt, Greece etc – very comfy sleep etc and huge villa but a bit dated – had its own kitchen, plunge pool and huge bathroom, bedroom and sitting
MANDAWA
Camels everywhere
area. Left Pushkar by 10a.m. and visited the local temple which is very famous with all the people of Rajasthan – then a bit of shopping in the local market before heading down to the ghats on the picturesque lake area – some of our group had the blessing done down in the water of the lake –a very sacred place and lots of locals here doing ceremonies. Everywhere you go you have to watch the cow poo – cows everywhere!!! Lots of people following us around the markets trying to push their wares – all a bit chaotic! Then we pushed on to our lunch spot before heading to Jaipur in the afternoon. What a great couple of days we have had!

Bella the Brave
India is filled with stray dogs. I was prepared for that. But then I met Bella.

Bella was lying by the main road in our village, helpless and sick. He was severely malnourished, barely able to walk, and totally unloved. You could see his ribs ripple under his skin every time he breathed.

And nobody seemed to care. Everyone here would walk straight over him.

I have been trying to feed him milk and soft biscuits this past week, but he remained extremely weak and unresponsive. He made my heart break.

So last night I got in contact with Rakesh, the founder of Voice of Stray Dogs (http://www.strays.in/). Check out their website! They are a not-for-profit organisation that rescues and gives medical treatment to stray dogs, and helps rehabilitate them. They have animal ambulances, and qualified vets on staff. Rakesh confirmed that they could treat Bella. I now had a plan...

This morning I found Bella, lying by the road as usual (see the photo), and carefully lifted him into a box with a towel as a bed. I was so worried I would hurt him, he was so fragile.

Tracey and I then caught
Where I picked Bella up
a bus and a rickshaw into Bangalore city, where the Voice of Stray Dogs has its office and shelter.

Rakesh, the founder came to meet me and Bella, and assured me that they would look after him! The vet said that Bella had a fever and an extremely low blood count, but they could help him!!!

I must admit I cried. I know that I cannot fix India's problems in a month, or even a village's problems. But you know what? I could solve this poor dogs problems. And thanks to Voice of Stray Dogs, I believe I did.

If you would like to follow Bella's progress, pop onto their website, and type in my email: sheree.venter@outlook.com

Also, if anyone is wondering, I named him Bella, because it means beautiful. When you look through the fleas and emancipation, you can see how beautiful he is.

One of our catch-phrases here is ""TII"" to stand for ""This is India.""

We just had a TII moment...

We were in Bangalore city for the weekend, and had to head home this evening. We found a lovely auto-rickshaw driver who would give us the meter fare, and was even willing to drive us ALL the way home! Usually this trip requires you to change rickshaw's twice, to put this into perspective. He was even willing to wait for us to finish dinner before driving us the final leg home. Top Bloke.

Except....there was one small problem...

His headlight was broken.

Like kaput. Out. Gone.

Oops.

Rural India. Rough roads. Speed bumps. Darkness.

Thankfully I had my teeny tiny torch on me (It's smaller than my pinky and puts out about 10 lumes). So for most of the trip home, I was half hanging out of the rickshaw, pointing this tiny flashlight at the road!

Only in India!

Playing Chinese Whispers
I am loving my time at the 40K plus pod here in Maralakunte. As many of you know, I have had trouble interacting with children in the past. I am loving it here though. The kids are lovely, enthusiastic and well behaved.

Pod time consists of the welcome song, and 2 sessions of 15 minutes on the tablets. These are broken up with ""Brain Breaks"" where we play games, such as Bullrush, Stuck in the Mud, Bang and Simon Says. Finally there is a 15 minute session of spoken English, where we generally break up into smaller groups to help the kids with conversational English.

40K is in the process of upgrading its curriculum and delivery method, changing it into a fully interactive app, which is very exciting!

Once again, please consider donating to 40K, to help these pods keep running until a totally financially sustainable business model can be implemented. The new interactive app is going to be amazing, but it is also a huge capital expenditure. Even five bucks makes a difference here!

Also, feel free to comment on these posts. I'd love to hear your thoughts and impressions. Any requests for a blog about
Tablet time
a particular aspect of life here is also welcome!

Asia » India » Karnataka » Hampi
January 10th 2014
Published: January 10th 2014


Vitthal Temple
Hampi, is a very beautiful place which I had been waiting to explore since quite sometime now which finally we (me and my husband) managed to plan it in December 2013 from 21st to 25th.

To start with what hampi is all about, Hampi is the former capital of Vijaynagar Empire where you can see beautiful Virupaksja temple, Vitthala temple, Lakshmi Narasimha and many more. The ruins of Hampi are a UNESCO world heritage site. Along with the beautiful Hampi ruins, you will find boulders all around which makes climbing on them an amazing experience.

We started off from Pune via VRL bus on 20th Dec. around 10:30PM and reached Hospet at 8:30 AM. It takes abt 9 hours to reach Hospet. Hampi is abt 30 minutes from Hospet... You can reach Hampi from Hospet via the state run buses or you can drive in a rickshaw. We being tired, hired a rick which charged us around 180Rs to drop us till Virupaksha temple.

We stayed on the other side of the river and abt 4 KMs after crossing the river. I had booked Gowri resort and was a perfect decision as the rooms were really clean and
Vitthal Temple
basic, had a nice swing on the front where I could sit hours together just gazing at the skies and the boulders.. They also had rice fields which added to the beauty... Also very close is Sanapur lake which is unexplored by tourists as its far from the main river but its really too beautiful.. The food was good too so we didnt bother to go out to eat ever.

You will also see a lot of foreigners staying on the other side of the river, mainly as Hampi is a holy place, you will not get non-veg food and Alcohol which is both available on the other side of the river.

We hired a bike for all the 4 days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay... Hiring a bike gave us the flexibility of reaching a place at our pace and not being bothered.. Bike is charged abt 200Rs per day and 100 Rs/liter petrol. We visited it at the right time so the temperature wasn't too high though by the end of the trip, i was all tanned. (which I still am recovering from ) Hampi is pretty hot during the day so ensure that you use
Pushkarini
sunblock all the time...

The highlight of the trip was Vitthala temple, Virupaksha temple, Ganesh temple, Matanga hills, Krishna temple and Monkey hill.. You shall visit Matanga hills if you stay in Virupaksha side of the temple and visit Monkey hill if on the other side of the river, for sunset.. You get a beautiful view of the entire Hampi from both the hills... we truly enjoyed seeing the view and wish could be on the hills every evening to see the sunset..

We had hired a guide for few hours to show us around Vitthala temple , Virupaksha temple, Matanga hills, Achutraya temple and all the important other ruins. It was nice to know the history behind these places. We went to Lakshmi Narsimha , Krishna temple, Shivlinga all by ourselves as it was all walking distance. Also we ensured that we travelled on bicycles one day (cycles are one of the ways to explore around Hampi) after we had seen all the important ruins and just be all by ourselves... we thoroughly enjoyed our bicycling experience... Coconut water helped us refresh ourselves whenever we were tired with cycling.

This has been one of the best
trips till date.. Do try to visit this place when in India and I am sure you will be happy you visited Hampi...

My Sari
We have arrived in Maralakunte, where we will be staying for the next month!

India

I have seen a massive juxtaposition between the wealthy and the poor here. We have walked through a village past a dog dying of starvation (I wanted to cry), and soon after passed a house with solar heating on the roof and a car out the front. In the city you occasionally pass the luxury car in your auto-rickshaw, for which you are paying 20cents per 1km!

Maralakunte

The village is larger than I expected, and has a brand new temple, which only opened recently. This means that they have celebrations every night for the following month, with blaring prayer music, gong-banging and incense burning! Lots of fun, unless you want to go to bed early, what with the temple across the road from our apartment!

PLUS +Pod

Today we attended our first +Pod session. The kids were amazingly keen, and excited!

The program runs for one hour, were the kids work in groups of three for 15 minutes at a time on a tablet, with ""Brain Breaks"" in the middle. We played Simon says in these
My Sari
And yes, I folded it/ put it on myself!
breaks- they seem to know their body parts!!

Impact project

As part of my stay here with 40K, we are working to set up a new Pod in a village called Chikajala about 15km from where we are staying.

We approached the local government school today, and had a mixed reaction. The English teacher seemed very keen on the idea of 40K Plus Pod, but apprehensive about the admission fee. We believe however that parents with recognise the value of the program focusing on improving their kid's English foundation.

It is so important to get these pods being financially sustainable and accessible to the poorest families, but achieving these dual aims is still hard. At the moment fundraising is making up the difference. Please think about donating to help us work towards a sustainable model. At the moment, the 200 kids in the program would not be here without your support! Visit http://makingadifference.gofundraise.com.au/page/VenterS to donate!

Tomorrow we will go back and talk to the other government school and another English teacher who is interested in facilitating the Pod classes.

I'll keep you updated!

After 18 hours on a plane, a stopover in Frankfurt and much fitful non-sleeping, I have arrived in India!

We landed at the ungodly hour of 2:30am, so truth be told, I'm a little bit like a walking zombie today!

I have made my first foray into the city to purchase some much needed coffee (a surprisingly acceptable latte) and Indian styled clothing.

I now have a beautiful sari (whose blouse is being tailored today, so I can't show you it just yet) and a traditional ""salwar kameez"" (the long tunic, trousers and scarf). I somehow feel like I paid more than I should have for these... but what the hell, being ripped off once or twice is part of the fun isn't it?

I'll check in soon, when I have some pics to post.

Also- please leave comments on these posts (even if it's just your name) since I'd love to know who is actually reading these! Cheers

30th December

Our last breakfast together as Pete and Jane were going home today. No radio active marmalade for a change, the colour of it has generally been bright to say the least. Very sad to say goodbye to them as they have been great travelling companions and also say goodbye to Bala, he had been great to have as our driver.... Sal got emotional again with all the goodbyes and as we were all hugging and saying goodbye a tuk tuk driver came and joined in! Sal and Col had a bit of time so took a short ride in a tuk tuk just because we like a ride in them and the driver was lovely, his name was Babu. He took us to see a huge tree, he said it was a rain tree that had been decorated for Christmas and found 2 kids playing cricket and Col had been longing for a game all holiday, at last he had his chance, the kids thought he was mad! Sal had a chat with their grandad who was so pleased we were British and said how the place wasn't the same since the British left India and rubbish/litter was
image
his main gripe. Next to where they were playing cricket on a rough bit of ground was the tuk tuk driver training and exam area, that figured! The tuk tuk driver spoke great English, between him and the man in the laundry we understood more than we did from the guide! The tuk tuk driver called his vehicle his open air 3 wheeled Ferrari!

As Jane and Pete headed to the airport, Col and Sal met their new driver David and smaller vehicle. We were heading north to a small village near to Palakkad. Apart from Bala we have decided all Indian drivers are mad and David was no exception, once out of the city, the road was one lane each way and not in great condition but they drove the same.... For instance, the car In front of us was overtaking a truck and we overtook both but at the same time the same was going on on the other side of the road so a 2 lane road had 6 cars abreast, we clenched our buttocks and closed our eyes! You have to give credit to the Motorcyclists and tuk tuk drivers who get pushed out of
image
the way and really have to have their wits about them constantly. Not that we would consider doing a self drive holiday here but if we did, Col's vehicle of choice would be a steam roller!

We stayed in a home stay again, an old family home that had been in the family for 5 generations. It was a beautiful old house with lots of dark rich wood and seemed to be built around what would have been 2 small bathing pools. Shoes left at doorstep. Our host had a long name, he said to call him Bugs and he had a dog called Dodger who was a pug and real character, he actually had 2 more dogs in kennels in the garden and 3 puppies of Dodgers too. We ate with Bugs in the evening, he had a woman housekeeper who cooked and served the most delicious food, it really was very good. He was slightly odd being mine host as he had dinner and breakfast with us as he said he did with all guests but never asked us anything, we did our best to keep a conversation going asking him various questions but he asked us
image
nothing, seemed odd. We went for a walk in the local village and were warmly welcomed by everyone we saw, but we were doing battle with Mosquitos which carried on for our entire stay, so inside seemed a better bet.

31st December

After breakfast in the garden, we set off for Coonoor which is a 4 hour journey mostly vertical. We have no idea how high up we drove but we passed some clouds. The journey wasn't the most comfortable as it was hairpin bend after hairpin bend and lots of overtaking going on, there are numerous signs saying dangerous bends, no overtaking......... Nobody read them. A couple of times we would have to stop as they had got in a tangle ahead of us and someone had to get out of a vehicle to make others move back to allow the traffic to move. Bus drivers are mad men +++, they go tearing along and take the downward bends on the wrong side of the road aaaggghhh! Our hotel is another homestay and we are in the deluxe suite, it makes us laugh how they like to big things up with names, it was hardly deluxe but
image
has lots of room and everything we need. David took us down to the town for an hour, it was pretty manic so an hour was probably enough. The market was lively as they all are, fruit, veg, flower garlands, clothes, shoes, bags and everything else you might ever need. Full of people and noise but fairly clean which was good to see. Our driver like most of them sleeps in the car which we feel quite uncomfortable about and can't imagine he gets that much sleep when he has so much driving to do, anyway we bought him some chocolate and nuts as a New Years Eve present.

Our hotel was offering a 'gala' dinner for New Years Eve, there was about 20 people and it was out in the garden. They had a roaring fire going as it was very cold being so high up and they did well, a good selection of food and a great guy making the breads, he would have given a pizza maker a run for his money with his style, we have to admit to sliding away at 11pm and tucked up in bed to see the New Year in plus
image
the hotel was dry so waiting another hour in the cold to raise a glass of water .... Hmmmmm. Our driver was parked up just a few feet away and he wouldn't have been offered anything by the hotel and no doubt there was loads left over...... Strange old world, which we didn't feel comfortable about at all.

1st January

Service at breakfast was non existent, after 3 requests and half an hour plus wait, we got some coffee, we gave up on the eggs! David drove us down to the railway station where we were going to catch the toy train to Ooty. It is a regular passenger service but travels through beautiful countryside so is popular with tourists. There were lots of signs on the station which made us laugh, the retiring room, 1st class waiting room though the upper class waiting room was locked (what's the difference between upper and 1st class!) on one station there was a dormitory room.

It was a lovely journey, a large Indian family were in the same carriage as us and they made very pleasant company to talk to, their older son age 13 had quite good English
image
and was keen to practice and their younger son had climbed up into the luggage rack and gone to sleep. David was there to meet us and start the descent, it was a longer but a much prettier route than the previous day and far less cars though we turned one corner to find a car on its roof though everyone seemed to have got out ok. We travelled through a wildlife park where there are suppose to be tigers but no luck this time and though we didn't see any, David said you could often see elephants here, we did see lots of deer.

We arrived in Mysore, another busy, vibrant, noisy town, cows and dogs everywhere, we went to Mysore Palace which was pretty spectacular though the Maharajah has just died, and it was a public holiday so overloaded with people, all having to remove shoes so there were piles of them, everywhere, we chose the free shoe storage desk which we thought gave us a better chance of finding them again, however, it might have been free but had the attendant demanding a tip to give us back our shoes!

Our hotel was very nice
image
with a lovely colonial feel. Big news, we were going shopping! Not much of that on this holiday! Sal had spotted a place earlier and had to try and get David back there! David was disappointed that Europeans don't barter, so, he came with us and after we had looked at the obligatory tourist shop went to a local place and he stood back whilst Col bartered and he was dead impressed! High fives! Later Sal had a hawker selling ankle bells which was not on the shopping list but it's all a game, he wanted 1200 rupees we got him down to 100 for 2 and we are sure he still made a profit! Anybody want any ankle bells?!

David was very keen to get us back to the palace for the sound and light show and we weren't disappointed, we really enjoyed it, followed by a great meal at our hotel.

2nd January

Very strange at breakfast this morning, having struggled to get a seat for dinner last night, there was nobody there, it was 8am which has been busy at every other hotel.

David had suggested a visit to Keshava Temple which way
image
just north of Mysore on our way to Bangalore, we are so glad he did as it was a stunning 13th century temple, the architecture was beautiful and the detailed carving was stunning, from here we went to Dariya Daulat Bagh, the summer palace of Tipu Sultan.... He was ringing bells from the V & A. This was 18th century and was intricately painted inside with flowers and peacocks plus some murals as well, in its day it would have been an amazing place but much has got damaged and weathered but they have started to restore so would be fabulous to see in a few years time.

The journey to Bangalore was through lots of very fertile countryside, loads of paddy fields, carrots, jasmine, cauliflower, sugar cane, banana and David had now got the hang of us that we wanted to stop and photograph everything that seemed everyday and normal to him and the opposite to us. We went into the paddy fields where they were cutting it and another where they were collecting it, shame on us we didn't even know what rice looked like when it was growing. We had 2 varieties of banana, quite different
image
in texture and taste, we didn't always get the best photos but it is amazing how friendly people are and willing to let you, in fact pleased to let you photograph them working. We saw loads of oxen pulling carts loaded up, must be hard work but the animals have very gentle eyes. There were herds of goats and sheep and we saw lots of donkeys as well, some of them just roaming. We loved it. We never cease to be amazed at the ladies deportment, carrying huge bundle of sticks or big pots of water on their head. Calfs and goats laying across the passenger's lap on motor bikes, too much to see!

We got to Bangalore, unfortunately on the outskirts an accident had not long happened and the person was dead, the drivers all slowed to have a look and then Immediately restarted whacky races, the person had been killed by a bus and the newspaper also said that a bus had crashed the previous day killing all on board.........

Bangalore was a traffic jam, this was David's home town, he said there was 100,000 tuk tuks on the road here and we didn't disbelieve him.
image
We saw a truck loaded up with motor bikes which were being taken away for illegal parking, can't say we had ever noticed 'parking' everyone seemed to leave their vehicle where they felt like it! This particular truck had a man running after it waving a fistful of rupees!

We went to the parliament building and palace and then a bit of time to walk around the old market area, we love this, get in amongst it! Shopping is a big deal in India and here the smart shops mixed with the more traditional shops, we added a bit more to the Indian economy of course.

Unfortunately the next stop was the airport to start the journey home, as always a lovely chap was at the airport from Indian Panorama to assist us. Nearly every stop we have been met by somebody from Indian Panorama to assist with anything we may need though everything has been so well organised we have never needed help, we can't praise them enough.

We had a flight (with piped music of the Christmas variety all the way!) to Mumbai with an overnight stop in the first hotel we stayed in more
image
than a month ago, before onwards to London the following day.

What a fabulous trip we have had, Jane and Pete were great travelling companions. Every day has brought a new experience, new sights, sounds and smells. India is an amazing place, sometimes it is a amazingly wonderful and sometimes amazingly sad and awful but never anything less than fascinating.

I will miss being called Shally or ma'am, we will miss the incredibly welcoming people and the lovely weather, the fantastic food and the fact that Delhi Belly didn't pay us a visit is a big plus. I am sorry I didn't get an opportunity to weave Sheila Dikshit into the blog, she is an Indian politician we read about and that name deserves a mention! What a fabulous holiday but we are looking forward to a cup of tea and our own bed.

November 30th 2013
Published: November 30th 2013


Gokarna
The view
So there I was heartbroken and just shy of my birthday. The question was where do I arrive and depart from here?

Forty-five minutes later I was rooting for the auto driver as he dodged traffic to get to the bus stand and then before I took stock of things I was on the bus en route to Gokarna with S.

It is funny how our weakest moment can set us free to live more bravely and truthfully. I hope Gokarna will take my mind off things but I take my mind along. A rookie mistake.

I don’t remember much of the bus journey except for the amourous exchanges between the couple in the berth across mine.

Day 1

We get off the bus in Gokarna. We trudge along lost and all we know is we have to head to Gokarna International. One look at it and then at each other’s faces, we are back on the street. An auto driver agrees to take us to Om Beach, named so as the beach seems to spell out Om the way it is written in Sanskrit. Soon we are on the hills zigzagging; these are the Ghats.
Gokarna
Play


Higher and higher and I get my first glimpse of the sea. It is green and brown and green and then there’s shimmering blue gazing up at me. That turn where I first catch sight of it – I forget everything and know I did the right thing coming here to this town named after the cows that are everywhere.

We arrive at the Namaste Café and get a cottage. We sit in the café for a while sea gazing. There are guests sunning themselves or smoking on the porches. But otherwise, it is quiet and deserted. We slather on Nutella on the toast. That was mostly what we ate during our stay.

The town is sweltering. But the shops beckon. There are adorable bandannas, dresses, stoles, harem pants and other hippie-ish clothes that soon help us blend in with the crowd. A young boy sells books in many languages, left behind by tourists and he speaks many languages too – Italian, French, Russian…and they are more than a smattering. Yet another invites us into his shop filled with drums, xylophones and more. He shows us how to hold the African drum pressed between our thighs and
Gokarna
Sunset and fairy orbs
how to slap its goat-skin surface with our palms to build a rhythm. He plays and plays until sweat drips down his hair and he is completely lost in the beats.

At a juice shop, we take a break to cool off. The heat is unbearable. A woman, a blonde and older version of Zeenat Aman crooning Dum Maro Dum, sits across the table. A big tikka on her forehead, huge sunglasses, a saffron kurta. She is met by a bald and tattoo-ed man and he asks us where we are from. She is heading to Bangalore, taking a train from there. He says we Indian women are beautiful and the woman swats his arm and laughs. I want to ask them where they are from, where is the train taking them to next, what did Gokarna bring to them…but I don’t.

We stop for a beer at a shack on Kudle beach and the decision is unanimous. We are trading Om Beach for Kudle. We also find the other Gokarna International. We trudge up a hill, the bendy soft grasses brushing our legs and at High Point the views stops us.

Day 2

The next morning, we pack our bags and make our move to Kudle. The descent is steep. We exchange hellos with other tourists. It is friendly and non-intrusive. It feels like we are looking at them and with our hellos we are really agreeing ‘isn’t this wonderful? Aren’t we glad to be here?’ These steep climbs turn into mini waterfalls during the monsoons we are told. The shacks are closed down, not the best time to visit Gokarna. But it is November and just the right time to be here and the clouds have long since cleared.

A man is practicing meditation. Barefoot, he is paying attention to every step he takes, feeling his feet press down into the stones and red earth. We don’t exist as he communes with the earth and his soul.

Day 3

We wake up to the sea. A few boats are bobbing on the waves. There are mostly families with children early in the morning. Children with pails playing in the pools between rocks the sea forgot to take back. The rocks have black crabs crawling on them. A woman in a neon bikini claims the rocks have changed positions, the sea goddess has moved them, she says.

Shells peek out of the sand, some broken and some whole. There are ridges drawn by the sea waves by swirling and pulling at the sand. We trace a circle around a dead starfish, the circle of life. There are sand mounds, castles decked with shells. A bunch of red flowers float by. A pentacle is enclosed in a circle. 369 it says.

Later an older crowd starts coming out. Some spread out the blankets and lay down to tan. Others occasionally run into the water to cool off. A couple exchanges a long kiss, the waves dancing around them. A man with dreadlocks collects shells to put in his hair. At night, it is pitch black and one can’t take a step forward without a long range torch. Only the shacks are alive.

We sit at the shack. More nutella and toast, interrupted by falafel and hummus (lots of Israelis around) and bonafie pie. And Somerset Maugham’s Of Human Bondage while not gazing at the sea.

The Grand Finale

As evening nears, crowds of people sit out on the beach. Cows wander in. There are men selling beaded necklaces. Frisbees in the air. A woman with tassled sticks does her thing. Some just lie back with a book. Slowly, as if by an unspoken agreement, the sea is clear of swimmers and everyone is out on the beach. The cows disappear. The chatter dies down. The clamor of a dog is brought to a halt as an old bearded man with chillum, roars out ‘Shanka!’ We watch the show. Now, there is only the sound of the sea.

A lone lithe woman with wispy blonde hair looks like a sylph thrown out of water. The evening was so heavy with magic, I would not have been surprised if her legs, as they teased the waves with light kicks, had turned into a shimmery green mermaid’s tail and the wave had whisked her away. She seemed to be doing a tango with the sea, taking a step forward as the wave receded and stepping back as it approached. Her boyfriend walked in, a wooden staff in hand, twirling it deftly.

Watching the long drawn out sunset with no promise of an encore, the sky splashed in neon pink, orange like a dragon’s breath and purple, the sun – a great orange ball – sliding down into the sea, I was restored and I made peace with the world. And then all was dark.

Sri Chamundeswari temple
Geo: 12.314, 76.6759

Mysore is a bustling city which main tourist attraction is the Maharaja's Palace. Tom really wanting to see it so I waiting for him to arrive to go inside. Tom was due to arrive on Sunday but missed his flight in London so didn't make it to Mysore until Monday. So I went around the place on my own for a day. I even tried street food and survived.

Chamundi Hill: to get there I took the bus 201 from City bus station. It is about half an hour away, up a hill. The place was crowded with Indian tourist. I did not bother to queue to see inside the temple or to get a free darshan (the lines were too long). So I just stayed around the temple, watching people doing some rituals before going in. It was interesting even if I have no idea what was going on.

Rail museum: I went there because the Lonely Planet wrote 'this one is a real gem' and 'half a day of fun'. Well I don't know if they have ever been there or not but this was a big disappointment. There is not much to see and I went around in
ritual
half hour. If I were them I would rather write something along those lines 'if you have some time to kill while waiting for your train in Mysore, you can have a quick look at the rail museum (it's only 10 rupies)'.

Maharaja's Palace: the Palace is illuminated on week-end days from 7 to 8pm. It looks very impressive, and they even have a marching band. The Palace is rather recent. The building was finished in 1912, 15 years after the previous one burned down. Learning form experience they built the new palace in stones and not in wood. When you are a foreigner you pay your entrance fee about ten times higher than Indians (it seems to be the same all over India). However you get an audio guide ‘for free' and this was very much appreciated. It's full of interesting facts and not too long.

Devaraja market: very lively bazaar. Highly recommended. It's full of colours, with the paints, the flowers... We were shown how to make incenses and drawn on our hands. I really enjoyed walking around, overwhelmed by the colours and scents.

Mysore est une ville grouillante dont la principale attraction touristique est le Palace des Maharajas. Tom voulait
impassive cows
le visiter donc j'ai attendu son arrivée avant d'y rentrer. Il était censé arrivér Dimanche mais comme il a raté son avion à Londres il n'est arrivé que Lundi. J'ai donc visité la ville toute seule pendant une journée. J'ai même été assez courageuse pour manger dans la rue et je n'ai même pas été malade. Mon estomac tient bien le coup.

Chamundi Hill : pour m'y rendre, j'ai pris le bus 201. Depuis la station de bus prés du palais on est en haut de la montagne en une petite demi-heure. Une fois là haut, je me suis retrouvée au milieu d'une foule de touristes indiens. La file d'attente pour rentrer dans le temple était très longue et ne semblait pas bouger bien vite. Du coup, je me suis juste baladée autour du temple en regardant les gens faire les rituels avant d'y rentrer. Je n'y comprends rien mais c'est intéressant.

Musée du rail : j'y suis allée parce que la Lonely Planet a écrit ‘une perle' et ‘une demi-journée de fun assuré'. Je ne sais pas si je suis allée au mauvais endroit ou si eux n'y sont jamais allés mais j'en ai fait le tour en une
women hairdo
demi-heure et ce n'était vraiment pas intéressant. Si je devais écrire un commentaire je dirais ‘si vous avez une longue attente en gare de Mysore, vous pouvez aller faire un tour au musée du rail, c'est seulement 10 roupies l'entrée'.

Palais des Maharaja : le palais est illuminé les soirs du week end de 19h à 20h. Ça rend vraiment bien et ils ont même une fanfare qui fait le spectacle. C'est un palais récent, sa construction s'est achevée en 1912. C'est à dire 15 ans après que le précédent ait brulé. Du coup, celui-ci est en pierre et non en bois. En tant qu'étranger, on paye la visite 10 fois plus cher mais on a droit à un audio guide. On a bien fait de le prendre car il est bien fait et rend la visite bien plus intéressante.

Le marché Devaraja : c'est le souk. Les couleurs; les bruits et les odeurs se mélangent dans ce lieux fermé et entassé. On a pu voir comment fabriquer des encens. On s'est baladé au milieu de sacs de fleurs et de tas de poudres colorées. On nous a même fait un dessin sur la main. On s'est régalé.

Demoiselle Crane
I mentioned demoiselle cranes in the last blog as a taster of things to come. A few months ago the BBC had an India series which included a wildlife programme from all different parts of India. That was where we saw about the small town of Khichan/Kheechan where the local community started putting feed out for visiting demoiselle cranes about 30 years ago which has created an amazing wildlife spectacle and we wanted to see it!

We said our goodbyes to Ashish and got in the car we had booked to take us the 120km to Khichan. It seems that many people travel around Rajasthan with a car and driver, particularly at this time of year as the trains are less reliable due to fog. We had cancelled a train and booked the car because we had been keeping an eye on the train we were due to catch and it had been regularly arriving a number of hours late which meant we were likely to arrive at our destination somewhere in the middle of the night. The car journey was as uneventful as it could be on Indian roads and we arrived at the small Kurja Resort (Kurja means
Demoiselle Cranes at the lake
crane in Hindi) in time for lunch. Yet again, we appeared to be the only people staying there for the 2 nights we were there though there was a rumour of a French family though we never saw them. It did mean that we got a lot of attention from the manager and after lunch he got one of his staff to drive us to the village to show us where the cranes hung out so we could find it the next day. They dropped us at a lake just outside the village where the cranes had gathered after their feed in the morning....there were thousands of them and the noise of them chattering, krrrk, krrk, krrrk, was constant. We became the centre of attention for a number of groups of Indians there - some tourists but some from the local big town, Phalodi, and we got the impression that some of them, particularly the teenage boys, actually went there to try to chat to foreign tourists. They were quite persistent in their questions, going beyond the usual what's your name, where are you from, can we take a photo. They even asked what my salary was and wanted to
Old Haveli
take a photo of me kissing Hugh!

After watching the birds for some time, we left the lake and walked back into the village which has a beautiful collection of old, crumbling havelis or mansions that almost seemed to be a ghost town apart from the odd cow and child. It's not clear why there were so many great houses built there or why many of them now seem to be abandoned. From there we set off to walk back to the resort across an open piece of scrubby land on which a game of cricket was being played. H was quite impressed by the standard and we stopped to watch for a while. We should have known better because soon we were surrounded by a gang of boys asking questions and wanting photos, including the main batsman who had just handed the bat to someone else to come and talk to us.

The room we had at the resort was large and comfortable but obviously designed to keep out the heat meaning that at this time of year it was absolutely freezing! They'd given us a fan heater but it was largely ineffective in a room that
Cricket
size so we huddled under the blankets after dinner catching up on some admin.

The alarm went at 6.30am the following morning and we listened to see if we could hear the birds. It was pitch black outside and very quiet so we stayed in bed for another half an hour before braving the cold, pulling on some clothes and going out into the gradually brightening morning. The gates of the resort were locked so we had to find a boy with a key first but then we walked out onto the field to the sound of krrking and cranes as far as the eye could see, with groups of them in V formations in the sky coming in and out in all directions. Without getting very close at all we seemed to disturb the nearest group and they all flew off making a real racket. We spent about an hour watching the birds on the plain and watching the sun come up then walked into Khichan and to the house next to the 'feeding ground' where people were gathering on the roof to watch. The local people are Jains rather than Hindu and though there are similarities between
Demoiselle Cranes outside the gates of Kurja Resort
the two they are quite distinct. Jains believe in the welfare of every being in the universe and health of the universe itself. As part of these beliefs, the local community began feeding the small number of demoiselle cranes that migrated to the area fro Siberia. At the time there were only a few hundred birds but putting out the feed each day has caused more and more to visit and now they reckon that there are over 20,000 come to the area each year. There weren't quite that many on the feeding ground but there were probably a few thousand and more in the surrounding fields. The noise was incredible! It was amazing to watch them move as a group making patterns. Occasionally there would be a temporary quiet as they all looked up from the seed they were eating and often a group would all take off together and the krrking would build up again. The house we were on belongs to Sevaram Malli Parihar who monitors the cranes and for many years has been looking after injured or sick birds. He's been critical in their conservation, having threatened at one point to go on hunger strike when
Demoiselle Cranes at the feeding ground
he realised that many birds were dying when the flew into power lines but he couldn't persuade the power company to cover the bare wires. Through his campaigning they did eventually protect the lines and so the birds. He also managed to get autopsies done on some birds to discover that they had been killed by pesticides. He has worked with local farmers to get them to stop using the chemicals and this has further protected the birds. Sevaram showed us some of the magazine articles that had been written about him along with pictures of him getting conservation awards and the little book in which he daily records the time at which the first birds appear in the sky, the time the first one lands in the feeding ground and the time the last one leaves. He also attempts to count the number of birds. But we had a breakfast to get back to so eventually set off back to the resort.

We'd not had enough of the birds and straight after breakfast we headed back and sat up on the roof for another hour or so as the temperature increased and the birds became more skittish. They
Demoiselle Crane
started flying off in larger and larger groups and when they took off together you could almost feel the updraft of air as they flew towards us and just over the wire on our side of the feeding ground. Finally we were too hot and said thank you to Severam and headed back again, for lunch and a lazy afternoon in the garden.

But we still hadn't had enough of the birds and so the alarm was set and we got up in the cold to head straight to the feeding ground again the following morning. We arrived about 7.30 and there were no birds on the feeding ground but groups were swooping around over our head. Gradually pigeons dropped in and started pecking at the grain and some of the groups of cranes flew lower and lower, sometimes seeming to cause a bit of mutual scaring with the pigeons flapping off as they came near. But finally, somewhere near 8am, the first crane came in to land. It was alone for some time but the sky was filling with cranes flying low so that we almost felt we had our heads in the middle of them until one
Demoiselle Cranes at the feeding ground
by one they dropped in to join the first one. After about 10 it speeded up and within minutes there were a few hundred. Sadly we had a car picking us up to take us back to Jodhpur for a flight so we had to say a final goodbye, dash back for a quick breakfast and jump in the car.

The manager had told us that a group from the BBC were going to be staying a few days later, taking all the rooms in the resort, to film the cranes so you should be able to see another of our locations on the telly at some point!

Hope storm Gertrude doesn't cause too many problems for people at home.

Geo: 12.314, 76.6759

This journey starts in Amritapuri and ends in Mysores 27h later. This is my first long distance travel in India and I am on my own.

First, I had to wave goodbye to Chloé. It is thank to her if I feel fine starting this journey, I had a great introduction to India. I jumped into a taxi. I got a good price because he had just dropped someone here and didn't want to go back empty.

At the bus station the taxi driver told me ''It's that bus''. So I climb in the designated bus and checked with a passenger ''Is this bus going to Ernakulam?''. Wobble of the head and slight movement of the shoulders and a movement of hand that to me seemed like he was pointing at a seat for me to seat. I was not convinced so I asked the critical question ''Ernakulam stop?''. Few seconds. Movement of head and shoulders and the man goes ‘'Ernakulam bypass''. OK so this is not my bus! I get off and go back to the station looking for a station warden. They are easy to spot, they wear beige uniforms. ‘'Bus to Ernakulam?'' ‘'That side'' said the man pointing at a wall. So I go around that wall, few people are waiting. I ask a woman ‘'Bus to Ernakulam?''. The answer was a wobble of the head and a sign of the hand that seemed to say ‘'stay here''. So I stood by her and looked at the buses coming in and out of the station. Signs are all in Malayalam (local language) so there is no chance I could understand a word. And suddenly, a slap on my harm, a quick head wobble and the women run toward a bus. Ok so that is the bus to Ernakulam, let's go. A man must have seen the scene and asked ‘'where to?'' ‘'Ernakulam''. Wobble of the head. That is definitely the right bus. I'm in! There is lots of empty seats and the back of the bus but I squish my bump next to a women in the second row. Few reasons for this behaviour: front seats are for women because some men don't like seating next to women (so mainly if not only accompanied women go at the back) and the bus have no suspension so at the back it's very bumpy. It is about 4h to Ernakulam. I spent 1h with a women half seating on my lap because the bus was crowded. I like looking outside but I hate looking at the road. They drive like the only commandment is ‘you must not leave an empty space'. It's epic!

From Ernakulam I easily made my way to Fort Kochi to pick up my big backpack that I had left at my previous hotel.

The next challenge was to reach Ernakulam Town train station. I took a bus at Fort Kochi that was supposed to drop me very near. We don't have the same definition of very near. I had to take another bus and then walk about 10min. And that part of town is not very nice, it was very dark. I finally made it to the station after asking my way 2 or 3 times. I was early. So I got some snacks for the ride and found the Ladies-only waiting room to seat and wait.

The train was about 30min late so I had plenty of time to find out where my carriage was. It was at the very front and trains are long long long. Inside, it was easy to find my sleeper and, as most people were already asleep, I just made myself comfortable and ready for bed. I had to take my jumper out of my bag because the AC was on. Good night.

I actually slept rather well. We arrived at Yesvantpur (Bangalore) earlier than scheduled (to my surprise). A rickshaw took me to the other train station. I was there at 10am already hungry so I had a Massala dossa. Spicy food for breakfast was not such a good idea. I think my stomach would have preferred something sweet. I had to wait on platform 7 for about 1h and after another 2h30 in the train I was in Mysore. The journey went smoothly except for the girl who kept wanting to feed me out of date crisp and chocolate. I noticed because the taste was a bit off... My hotel and a well-deserved shower were only a short rickshaw ride away from the train station. I have done it! I guess I can go anywhere now.

Mon périple commence à Amritupiri et se termine à Mysore quelques 27h plus tard. C'est mon premier trajet longue distance en Inde et je suis toute seule. Allez je vous raconte !

Tout d'abord il a fallu dire au revoir à Chloé. C'est grâce à elle que je me sens prête pour entreprendre ce grand trajet toute seule. Elle m'a fait une très bonne introduction de l'Inde. J'ai pris un taxi pour aller jusqu'à la station de bus car il venait de déposer des gens là où j'étais du coup il m'a fait un bon prix. En me posant, le chauffeur m'a dit « c'est ce bus ». Du coup, je monte dans le bus qu'il m'a montré et là je procède à la vérification de rigueur avec un passager. « Est-ce que ce train va à Ernakulam ? ». Mouvement de la tête et petit mouvement d'épaule, accompagnés d'un signe de la main qui semble dire ‘assieds-toi là'. Bon je ne suis quand même pas trop sûre alors je re-vérifie « Arrêt Ernakulam ? ». Après quelques secondes l'homme me regarde, secoue la tête et les épaules et lâche « Contourne ». Bon donc ce n'est pas mon bus ! Je descends et me rend dans la gare routière à la recherche d'un employé. Ils sont en général assez facile à repérer tout habillé en beige. J'en repère un et lui demande « bus pour Ernakulam? ». Mouvement de tête, il pointe un mur et dit « De ce côté ». Donc je contourne le mur dans la direction indiqué et me retrouve avec un petit groupe de personnes. Je demande à deux femmes « bus pour Ernakulam? ». Pour toute réponse j'ai eu droit à un mouvement de tête et un signe de la main qui cette fois veut dire d'attendre ici. Cette fois j'en suis presque sûre donc je ne bouge pas et j'attends. Je regarde le va et vient incessant des bus avec leur affichage en Malayalam (zéro chance que je comprenne quoi que ce soit). J'étais là, perdue dans mes pensées quand tout d'un coup…une tape sur le bras, un mouvement de tête et les femmes s'élancent vers un bus. Bon ça doit être aussi le mien. Un homme qui se dirige aussi vers ce bus me demande « Vers où vous allez ? » « Ernakulam ». Mouvement de tête. Ok c'est le bon bus. J'embarque. Je me trouve une place à l'avant en me serrant contre une dame et ce malgré le fait qu'il y ait plein de places vides à l'arrière. En fait les banquettes avant sont plus ou moins réservées aux femmes alors mieux vaut se mettre là. Et puis il n'y a pas vraiment de suspensions dans les bus ouvert donc à l'arrière ça secoue méchant. Le bus se remplit et je me retrouve avec une femme à moitié assise sur mes genoux pendant près d'1h. Pour les 3h restantes j'ai de la place. J'aime bien regarder le paysage défiler. Par contre j'aime moins regarder devant. Ils conduisent comme si le seul commandement était « sur la route, tu ne dois pas laisser d'espace vide ». Du coup c'est épique !

Une fois à Ernakulam je n'ai pas du tout galéré pour aller récupérer mon gros sac que j'avais laissé à l'hôtel d'avant.

Par contre, rejoindre la station de train Ernakulam town fut plus compliqué. J'ai pris un premier bus qui devait soit disant me déposer tout près. Bon on ne doit pas avoir la même notion de tout près… Il a en fait fallu que je prenne un autre bus, et donc que je demande mon chemin et que je décrypte maints hochements de tête ! Après ce deuxième bus, j'ai dû marcher environ 10min. J'étais bien contente d'arriver à la station car le coin était plutôt sombre et pas super rassurant. Une fois que j'ai eu demandé quel était mon wagon et ma couchette, je me suis acheté des bricoles pour manger dans le train et j'ai patienté dans la salle réservée aux femmes.

Le train avait 30min de retard. Une fois à l'intérieur il y avait déjà des gens qui dormaient donc je me suis installée pour passer la nuit. Evidemment la clim est à fond donc j'ai sorti mon sac à viande et mon sweat. Bonne nuit.

J'ai plutôt bien dormi même si je me suis faite réveiller à 7h du mat' par les autres passagers qui voulaient s'asseoir (j'ai la banquette du bas). On est arrivé à Yesvantpur (Bangalore) en avance. De là j'ai pris un rickshaw jusqu'à l'autre station de train. J'ai mangé une Dossa Masala pour le petit dej' mais je crois que mon estomac aurait préféré quelque chose de moins épicé. J'ai dû attendre 1h sur la plateforme 7 que mon train arrive et 2h30 plus tard j'étais enfin à Mysore. Il m'a fallu prendre un dernier rickshaw enfin d'arriver à mon hôtel. Après une bonne douche (à l'eau froide), j'étais requinquée. En tous cas je me suis plutôt bien débrouillée, je pense que maintenant je dois pouvoir me rendre à peu près partout !

my saree
Geo: 12.314, 76.6759

My first mission in Mysore was to buy a saree. I asked at my hotel where to get one and for what kind of price. A guy told me I would find the best deals at the Government Silk factory. It is also what the Lonely Planet says. So I went there. I gave them my budget and the women didn't try to convince me to get a more expensive one. And what I really liked was that the prices were written on each piece of fabric, which mean they don't make up a price for foreigners.

You get a seat and then the show begins. The women unfolded many sarees on the table in from of me. Everything that had a little bit of pink or purple was eliminated. From the start I liked one that was burgundy and gold with peacock motifs. The good thing is that you can wear them over your shoulder to see if the colour will suit you. I tried few different colours and patterns until the choice was down to two. The above mentioned one and a turquoise blue one with a leaf pattern. After a wee while I settled for the burgundy
how to put a saree on
and gold with peacocks. As they say, first choice is always the best!

Once you have the piece of fabric, they call the tailor, he takes your measurement to make the blouse and the skirt that goes underneath. I also asked them to show me how to put it on. It is not too difficult but it will require some practicing. They also gave me a 'manual' to use as a reminder.

I think I got all that for a rather good price, 2 420 rupees which is about £25. Not bad for a 6m long piece of silk and tailored top.

The tailor brought everything to my hotel and I tried it on. He just said 'You look very different'. No kidding! Look forward to the pictures guys!

Ma mission principale à Mysore est d'acheter un saree. Donc une fois installée à l'hôtel je me renseigne pour savoir où je peux trouver un saree au meilleur prix. L'homme me dit d'aller à la boutique de la fabrique de soie du gouvernement. C'est aussi ce que recommande le Lonely Planet donc j'y vais. En arrivant je leur donne mon budget et la dame ne se met pas en tête de me faire dépenser plus. Et ce que j'ai trouvé vraiment bien c'est que les prix sont écrits sur chaque pièce de soie. Donc ils ne peuvent pas faire un prix différent en fonction du client.

Tu t'assieds et là le show commence. La vendeuse sort une pile de saree et commence à les ouvrir. Tous ceux qui (de près ou de loin) avaient du rose ont été éliminés rapidement. J'ai tout de suite bien aimé un bordeaux et or avec des motifs de paons. Ce qui est bien c'est que tu peux les mettre sur tes épaules pour voir comment ça fait. J'en ai essayé pas mal avant de réduire mon choix à deux. Celui mentionné plus haut et un bleu turquoise et or avec un motif de feuille. Après un long moment d'hésitation j'ai opté pour l'option bordeaux, or et paons. La première idée est toujours la meilleure !

Une fois la pièce de soie choisie, le tailleur vient prendre tes mesures pour faire le haut et la jupe de dessous. J'ai aussi demandé que l'on me montre comment le mettre. Ce n'est pas trop compliqué mais ça va demander un peu d'entraînement. Ils m'ont même donné une feuille avec les explications. Je pense que je me suis bien débrouillée et que je n'ai pas payé trop cher. C'était juste 2 420 roupies ce qui fait un peu moins de 30€. Ce n'est pas si mal pour une pièce de 6m de soie et un haut sur mesure.

Le tailleur m'a tout amené à mon hôtel le soir même. Du coup j'ai essayé l'ensemble et il a dit « Ça vous change » Non, sans blague ! Vous verrez les photos.

Best time to visit: October-March

Road Conditions: Very Good/some patch of village road (Mostly Toll Roads)

Fooding/Lodging: Yes

Days needed to see : average 3 full days.

The historical town of Hampi, is one of the most important tourist destination on the Indian as well as international map. Located in the state of Karnataka, the town is popular for its intricately carved temples and stone sculptures. Some of the most popular temple structures here include Shri Virupaksha Temple, Balakrishna Temple, Shri Vijaya Vitthala Temple and Sasivekalu Ganesh Temple. Few must see are : the Stone Chariot at Vitthala Temple and Ugra Narsimha statue at Lakshmi Narasimha Temple.

For history lovers and for pilgrimage alike, this place offers a lot. Much more about this place can easily be found from various blogs available over internet.

My trip summary and recommendations for Hampi:

In general Hampi can be divided into two sets of places depending on the taste of the traveller.

1. For
Coracle_ride_on_Tungabhadra
Pilgrims : Hampi relates it to the ancient theology of Ramayana. It is considered to be the land of Monkey (Vanara) King Bali and his brother Sugriva, who ruled the kingdom called Kishkinda. This kingdom is identified to be the regions around the Tungabhadra river. The best way to have a peek of this region is to visit “Anjaneya Parvat”, said to be birthplace of Lord Hanuman. This peak offers very nice panoramic view of the Tungabhadra region. Places which can be spotted from there are: Matanga hills, Vitthala temple, Rishimukha Parvat etc. For pilgrims the places that can be covered are: Anjana Mata Temple, Lakshmi Temple, Durga Temple, Anjaneya Temple and Ranganatha Temple. If you are staying in Hampi, the best way to cover all of these is to cross the river from the Hampi Bazaar’s side. There is a frequent boat/coracle service which charges 10/50 rupees per trip respectively. Then you can take moped or negotiate for an auto rickshaw to show you all of these places. If you have stamina left then you can choose to cross river from the Anegundi village’s side and cover few more spots on the way back to Hampi at your stay.

2. For History and Architecture lovers: Hampi and nearby places offer most of what Hampi is known for. You can start your day after taking a bath in the nearby ghat and then head towards “Virupaksha Temple”. Then you can plan you morning covering Hemakuta Hills, Kadalekalu Ganesha Temple, Sri Krishna Temple, Badavilinga Temple, Narasimha Temple, Veerabhadra Temple, Sister Stones, and the Main Royal enclosure of Hampi which has plenty of places exhibiting amazing sculpture work on stones, done mostly during the Vijayanagar kingdom. My recommendation would be “Hazara Rama Temple” to witness mostly preserved art work depicting the stories of Lord Rama from Ramayana. You can head back to Hampi bazaar for lunch and have some rest as it gets too hot during afternoon.

Evening: get ready for a walk of around 3+ hours taking you to divine history. Start towards Hampi main bazaar street and feel the glory of most blossomed Vijayanagar empire having a street market which is known to be selling precious gems and other commodities. Take left to the royal walk way towards river. You will get to see a soothing Tungbhadra. You can get a coracle ride across the river to see
Hampi_Bazaar_from_Matanga_Hills
few other secret places, one of them is the “Sahasra lingaam”. On the way ahead you can see few other temples and finally the most hyped “Vitthala Temple”. This temple is indeed of much interest and worth taking a guide who charges 150 rupees. This temple houses the most spectacular structure called “The Stone Chariot”. If you have enough time you can covers the nearby places which do passes amazing beauty of tranquillity else you can head straight towards main road. You can take a ride on the electrically operated vehicle which drops you at the gate side and charges 10 rupees each passenger. Take an auto back to you stay.

Next day you can plan for Matanga hills. People generally to go up to see sunset rather than sun rise for a better view. Depending on your plan you can over few more places of your interest at the foot hill of Matanga hills like; Veerabhadra Temple and Achutaraya Temple. Sun generally goes down at 6:30 PM and it gets dark very fast then after, so avoid staying at the peak for too late.

My travel itinerary says minimum 3 days for Hampi but you can make
hampi_ghats
it in 2 days if willing to skip few places and have lots of stamina to walk and climb. You can opt to stay in main Hampi Bazaar or stay across the river where you can find better options for food as well as for lodging.

If you get little more adventurous then probably you can follow my trip itinerary which covers few other place, obviously it will cost you few more days J : https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=215053520020715622475.0004e2565d6c1b32465b3&msa=0

A trip to the south Indian temple town of Kumbakonam is indeed a very informative and exhilarating experience.The trip invariably leads one to the various temples of the Chola dynasty replete with religious fervour and architectural finesse.I commenced my journey from Bangalore and travelled by an overnight train.It covered the journey of about 600 Kms in 11 hrs.This small temple town draws crowds who come mainly to pay obeisance to the presiding deities of the navagraha temples.Some of these temples are indeed marvels of architecture built by the Cholas.It definitely helps if one has a personal transport since the temples are situated in different directions and to make it to all these places in a brief span of time can be strenuous and tiresome.There are a number of hotels for the budget conscious traveller.

One could also include Thanjavur in the itinerary which is known as the granary of South India due to its extensive paddy growing fields which are a feast for the eyes'As regards accomodation at Kumbakonam one can pick and choose an accomodation suited to one's budget.Typical Indian or specifically South Indian cuisine is available in most of the hotels.It is better to have one's own transport

Asia » India » Karnataka » Chikmagalur
September 21st 2013
Published: April 19th 2016


We're almost there !
I was hoping for a monsoon ride in 2013 but it did not happen due to some reasons, so thought of recompensing it with a drive. It was almost end of monsoon and one of my friend and my colleague (then) Kunche Swamy was okay with the plan as he was not very fond of long rides. None of us had a car, so hired one, and it came on time to pick me up around 10.30 pm. We had one more person with us to fill the seat, Venkat – Swamy’s friend.

After picking everyone, we reached Tumkur highway by 12.30, and then stretched to Chcikmagalur by stopping once or twice for tea. While going, Swamy could not hold the very desire to drive a car on a highway, but the driver refused it with a smile.

Chickmagaluru : We reached Chikmagalur town early in the morning, its around 260km from Bangalore. I do not remember whether we took rest in a hotel room or straightaway left to Mullayangiri Peak. I remember reading some broachers available there regarding Chikmagalur and places nearby. Chickmagalur literally means ""The town of the younger daughter"" in the native Kannada language. The town
Ch!ll!ng Wind @ Mullayangiri Peak
is said to have been given as a dowry to the younger daughter of Rukmangada, the great chief of Sakrepatna and hence the name . This is the story I hv read somewhere online. Chikmagalur was one of the place where coffee was cultivated early in ‘India’ soil. Rivers like Tunga - Bhadra have their sources in the mountains here which are parts of the Western Ghats. Chickmagalur district also contains Mullayanagiri, the highest peak in Karnataka.

The city is placed within a scenic landscape in a fertile valley; it is surrounded by lush green coffee plantation hills. The distance from Bangalore makes this place a perfect weekend getaway, and if that happens to be in monsoon through the Western Ghats, man you wouldn’t have to think twice.

Mullayanagiri : This is the highest peak in Karnataka, located within the range of the Western Ghats of Chikmagalur Taluk, and one of the best trekking place in south India as well.

On the way, when the scene became bit bright, we got down from the cab for an early morning photo-shoot near some estate gate. We reached peak after a tough drive, it was foggy and rainy too,
MoodScape
finally just before the peak, we got down from the cab as we could not see anything in the front. We used mobile phone indicator application to give driver some clues. Unless you are an expert in driving seat, stay away driving till the peak. The road to Mullayanagiri is very narrow with views from steep cliffs. Driving to the peak is almost impossible and includes a trek up the hill from the half-way point. From the topmost point on the hill, the Arabian Sea might be visible on clear days. However, ours was not a day of such weather.

The earlier you reach, the better the sight, else it may start raining, but we couldn’t make it early. With the light rain we climbed the stairs to the top. The rainy winds were so powerful; we were feeling we might be thrown down the hill at any point of time. Nevertheless, it was a life time experience to cherish. I feel chilled while writing about it. We lost our way while coming back, the driver had looked for a short cut to Kemmanagundi.

Kemmangundi : I do not remember whether we ate something until we reached Kemmanngundi.
Fairy-tale Land : Mesmerizing Place on the way to Kemmanagundi
Oh yes we has some snacks and tea at Mullayangiri . The one thing I can’t comprehend (in Karnataka) was the smallest glasses (plastic) used for serving tea at many places. I wish I had carried a cup.

The route through Kemmanagundi Hills were terrible, so much of, super muddy potholes, (scene might have changed now.) we were anticipating soon we have to come out of the cab and push it from behind, or we would be getting a flat tire, but nothing happened. We often stopped and captured the fairy tale scenic views on the way. Then reached top of a hill called Rajendra Hill, which we heard is extremely rich in iron ore. Rajendra Hill is one of the highest peaks in Karnataka encompassed by coffee plantations. We then got into same Krishnarajendra Hill Station Park.

We spent some time and had some late lunch there in a motel. We then moved to Habbi/Hebbe falls to give the day a dashing end. It was raining at times. On the way we saw mesmerizing hills in different moods and shapes and was about to set the sun off.

Habbi/Hebbe Falls : Hebbe Falls are located few
At Hebbe Falls
km away from Kemmangundi hill station . By the time we reached there, it was late in the evening. These sprightly falls are inside a coffee estate and can be reached either by walk or four-wheeler, Surrounded by dense forests and coffee plantations. Don’t miss a refreshing dip in this herb-infused water. If you want to come here, Let the monsoon come first, then a trip through the Western Ghats .

Initially, we had to take a small diversion to get on the “road” to Hebbe Falls. When it’s pouring in monsoon, it becomes a slushy mess that can be navigated only by cars with good ground clearance. As we neared the place beyond which cars can’t go, we got down from the car, as soon as we started walking, leeches attacked us from all directions. Man, the only way to escape was to go back or run faster and faster. I was not wearing a shoe then, but a sandal with a strap, so leaches could easily stick and suck my blood. The surroundings were dripping wet, fresh and aromatic due to rain.

After a short 20 minute run and crossing three streams, we heard the thunder
Motel at Hill Station Park
of the waterfall. As with the thunder, my heartbeat also increased. What we saw next was a sight to behold!

Tremendous amounts of water were cascading down two levels of the waterfall. We could not capture the other level due to misty weather in the late evening. The water spray was too much to handle. We couldn’t even keep our eyes open. There was no much people around except the few of us, and I think Venkat has not come till the end. We could not spent a long time near the waterfall and getting wet and dark. We could not take much pics due to slight rain and fog in the air. We should ‘ve reached bit early.

The fun was to get rid off leaches while we were back to cab, none of us had any spare dress, except a towel and a boxer kept for shower in the falls, we removed everything and each one helped other for finding leaches from the body, and Swamy sat in the cab only in towel, me in boxer, somehow dried our t-shirts and banyans to make a run to the hotel room when we reached in Chikmagalur town.
Swamy teaching the lady how to use smartphone


kudremukh : The next day early morning, after shower we checked-out from the hotel and had breakfast outside. The plan was to go to kudremukh for a trek. 95 kms southwest of Chikmagalur is the secluded hill station of Kudremukh. Situated 1894 m above sea level, the Kudremukh hills overlook the Arabian Sea and are chained to one another with deep valleys and steep cliffs. There is rich flora and fauna here, waiting to be discovered. There was a lot to be explored. A lovely places to camp. No trekker would be able to resist Kudremukh

We were going through the tea estates and we stopped for some clicks perhaps a freshly made tea from the same tea estate. A young lady from the small shop made tea for us from her house just behind the shop, it had a unique taste. We were chatting with her while having tea. Her subservience and some sort of rural innocence were very aesthetic and feminine. Swamy had tough time in explaining some old ladies who work in the tea estate on how to operate a smart-phone, but even after his lecture they were unable to take his pics. He posed
Kudremukh hills
again when I took my cam in hand. Another fun happened when we left the place and all of a sudden remembered I had forgot my pullover in the shop. When we reached the shop again, the pullover was not there. We looked everywhere. Again we got into the cab and later realized I was wearing the same pullover. I wondered how come even others were not find it on me!

Finally we were at the starting place of Kudremukh trek , but we were so disappointed to hear from the localities that the trek tem with the guide had left an hour before we reached. It wouldn’t be prudent to go without a guide for first timers. So we finally thought to have an early lunch from a small hotel and the meals were delicious. The lady who supplied the food felt so happy by seeing the way I was having it. The disappointment of the trek miss throgh amazing kudremukh hills faded a bit after the food.

So we thought we will have a drive through the hills in other direction and perhaps do some chilling in another falls nearby Kudremukh hills. So finally we reached
HanumanaGundi Falls
though we lost our way in between. Someone had shifted the sign board to a wrong direction

HanumanaGundi Falls : This Falls is situated in Kudremukh National Park between Kudremukh Road and Lakya Dam. The site featuring this beautiful waterfall is a popular climbing spot. The 100 ft waterfall can be accessed from 400 steps that are climbed down from the main road to reach the site. Hanumana Gundi Falls is managed and maintained by forest department of the state government. Along with the fall, tourists can also visit Bhagavathi Nature Camp. I had this dejavu feeling when I reached here and while stepping down close to falls. Yes few years back when I visited mangalore with my colleagues to attend a friend’s marriage at Uduppi, we had visited here while coming back. Since we alredy had too much experience in water and rain and fog previous day, we laft the falls after an hour or so. We had evening tea. Then while coming back visited one more place called Lakya Dam.

The Lakya dam was not like a dam as we expected. As per the information shared , it is a check dam built across the river
Lakya Dam
Lakya, a tributary of the Bhadra river. The dam was constructed by Kudremukh Iron Ore Company. This dam was built with the objective to collect silt and other waste materials from the mining industries situated beyond Kudremukh. The dam also acts as a source for the irrigation of agricultural lands in Kudremukh.

The dam gives an awesome views for photo enthusiasts and peace of mind for nomads . We spent some quality time there and when the sun was almost ready to set completely, they were ready to close the gates.

We then did not made any further plan other than coming back!

View from inside the temple
Geology Rocks! - Ross Gellar, NY

Stepping off yet another overnight sleeper train with the standard array of snorers, starers and people that think it’s acceptable to hock the nastiest sounding loogies from way up in their sinuses and flob them out the window, we arrived in Hospet.



From Hospet, we would need to take a 30 minute or so Tuk tuk to Hampi for which we were already dreading the obligatory haggling with the local drivers. ‘Fortunately’ for us, there was a guy on our train who had a tuk tuk parked outside (how this was possible, I don’t know) who followed us down the platform asking if we needed a ride into town. Having had this kind of hassle many times before, we decided to sit on the platform with a cup of unbelievably sweet tea and wait him out. Not realising this was probably the only driver we had come across in Asia with a tiny bit of patience, he played us at our own game, dug in his heels and called our bluff. After about 20 minutes of this, he appeared to finally cave, and came over quoting us a good price…we were
Streets of the Bazaar
shocked. Looks like this actually worked? We would be testing this theory again for sure.

Sure enough, half an hour passed and we were whizzing around the skinny dirt streets of Hampi Bazaar dodging everything from people, bikes, other Tuk tuks, cows and of course cowpat before arriving safely outside our hotel of choice, Rocky’s.

Straight away, we knew this was more our scene. Chilled and relaxed, plenty of fellow travellers around (it had been sometime since we had seen other ‘travellers’) and more Ali Baba pants than you can shake a monkey stick at…. Finally a place we felt we could get on board with.

After registering our arrival with the police (everyone has to do this, we are not known criminals or anything) we took a walk around Hampi.

This place has been described as beautiful, magical, and even otherworldly, and on first glimpses of the terrain and landscape here, we could easily see why. Hampi hosts some of the most incredible ruins either of us have ever seen, all of which are surrounded and sometimes embedded in a mass of giant boulders and rocks that stretch as far as the eye can see.
Woman visiting Ganesh
It really is one of them places that needs to be seen to be believed, and also one that is on a huge scale.

The first set of ruins we went to visit seemed to go on for miles, with amazing architecture everywhere you looked. Not wanting to see too much of the area to quickly, we stopped after a good few hours to ‘save’ some temples for another day. After coming back to the bazaar however, we were shocked to find that we had only covered a tiny piece of what this place had to offer, and if you wanted to, you could probably spend weeks here exploring.

We quickly decided that this was a place we would like to hang out in for a few more days, and spent plenty of that time flitting between temples and walks among the landscape, with relaxing and reading on the floor cushions of the local restaurants and cafes.

The closest temple to the bazaar has a resident elephant, Lakshmi who will ‘bless’ you for 1 rupee. This consists of putting a coin in Lakshmi’s trunk who then passes the coin to the handler. She then blesses you by
Lakshmi the blessing elephant
raising her trunk and patting you on the head with it…. Quite amazing I must admit. Not usually one for gimmicks like this, I couldn’t resist a blessing from an elephant guru and decided to part with my rupee. I was shocked when Lakshmi refused the coin and my blessing was snubbed. Knowing that I was a tourist, she wanted 10 rupees from me! Obviously this was either from an invisible signal from the handler, or this elephant really was a guru or something , but either way, I was strangely impressed and so parted with 10 rupees (about 10p). Again realising I was a tourist, Lakshmi’s trunk was resting on my head for longer than the locals so we could get the photo….amazing stuff!

The next day, we were able to see Lakshmi get her daily wash down by the river, and having watched this and seeing her thoroughly enjoying it, we were reassured that she was being treated well which pleased us both.

Hampi really was exactly what we were looking for after such a rollercoaster ride in India so far, and sitting here writing this on our roof terrace as the day draws to a
Ladies...
close, we will both be sad to leave this little slice of heaven. However, it’s time to motivate, and we are now off to Goa. Being the rainiest month to visit Goa (July), we are certainly not expecting much in the way of sun, however we hope to enjoy the little capital of Panaji for a few days.

Signing off…

Asia » India » Karnataka » Mysore
July 23rd 2013
Published: August 10th 2013


St Philomenas Church
‘’Its not about how hard you can hit, it’s about how hard you can be hit and keep moving forward – Rocky Balboa



So, after a fairly relaxing time in Kodai, we were off in search of even more downtime in the city of Mysore, home of Ashtanga Yoga.

We had booked ourselves into a great little hotel not too far from the centre for a great price and were looking forward to seeing what Mysore had to offer. We were willing to stay here for a few weeks or even a month if we liked the feel of the place and if we could get something good going on with one of the local Yoga places….but with no real plans, we were just going to play this by ear.

Our first venture out of the hotel by foot seemed to be a clear indication of what Mysore was going to be like for us, and in all honesty, we should have realised there and then, that this wasn’t going to be our favourite place. Without a map or a clear idea of where the main town or where the major focal point -
Mental streets of Mysore
Maharaja’s palace was, we hit the streets of Mysore. Going the completely wrong direction to the aforementioned landmarks, we ended up wandering the clogged and crazy streets before finally seeing something we recognised. It was St Philomena’s Church and to be honest was hard to miss. Knowing this wasn’t really where we wanted to be, we were still glad to be in the vicinity of a large landmark that we had at least heard of. Walking towards the church however, brought us a hoard of unwanted guests. Tuk tuk drivers, taxis, unofficial guides and even carpet salesman attached themselves to us like flies round shit. Being at what would seem to be a fairly touristy sight, we assumed there would be other tourists getting some of the share of hassle, however being the only westerners close by, we may as well of had ‘Please…try ripping us off’ plastered across our foreheads, with an addition of ‘If we say No Thank-you, just try ten times harder and I’m sure we will change our minds’

It was relentless.

So, after a quick look around the place and posing for a few Indian tourists photos, we promptly made a bolt for
Locals that insisted on a photo with Donna
the exit. Perhaps not making ourselves clear the first ten times, the same undeterred faces were waiting for us for another go at selling us stuff we didn’t need nor want. Man, these guys were persistent.

After finally escaping from the church, dodging traffic as well as a few goats and cows, we finally found ourselves a hotel in which to have lunch and more importantly to get away from the chaos of the streets. This was essential as having little sleep from the train and no breakfast, we were just about ready to lose it.

Our next day was probably the best one we had in Mysore, where we visited the Maharaja’s Palace. This wonderful structure really was quite amazing inside and out, and along with all the visual charms and interesting history, it also served as a great way to escape from the craziness that was on the other side of those walls…..

Having had this fine day, and growing in confidence with walking around the streets, dodging stares, invites to tours and what not, we decided to head into the epicentre of chaos and to take a look around the Devaraja Market.

What
Beautiful Palace
on earth were we thinking? Just when we thought we were getting better at batting off people and staying incognito, we decided to do this……

Upon reaching the outskirts of the market, we were mooching around and taking in the sights and the smells of this bustling area, and then we made our way into the market itself. Being the only tourists around, we were of course immediately jumped on by every market seller in the place.

It was uncomfortable to say the least for me, however with no women to be seen it was even worse for Donna. After about 3 minutes into being pulled this way and that to buy this or smell that etc, Donna then had her arse grabbed by some shady guy who disappeared off into the carnage. Despite wanting to see the market in full swing and take a few snaps, this was too much as far as we were concerned, and so we swiftly made our way to the exit, fuming at the guy who had ruined our visit, and really quite horrified at some of the people walking around here. I understand some people may take this with a pinch
Colouful
of salt and say it’s to be expected, but for us, it’s just a massive invasion of space and no one should have to put up with this crap, anywhere.

For the rest of the day, we stewed on this incident, and really started to question why we were here. Why were we putting ourselves though this kind of stuff? The stares, the constant badgering, the trash everywhere and now this. It just all seemed to hit us at that moment, and we both just felt like throwing the towel in there and then…it was just one of those moments I guess.

Deciding perhaps booking some Yoga would brighten our time here, we were disappointed to learn that most people that come here for the Yoga was on a month training basis etc and there were generally specific dates that courses started on. The course that we wanted to get on wasn’t for another few weeks, so this just seemed to add to our already sombre moods.

Still, after time to cool off, a nice dinner and some beers, we shook off the bad vibe we had and decided to just get on with things. We knew
Having a beer
that India wasn’t going to be the easiest place to travel, and that there would be things to test us along the way, but that was almost one of the pulls of travelling this place for us, the challenge. We could easily have decided to quit and go somewhere easy and less frantic, but where’s the fun in that? Having dusted ourselves off, we agreed to head to the Railway museum. To be honest, this didn’t sound hugely appealing as neither of us own an anorak nor do we get our kicks from trains, however, this place was billed as a ‘’half a day of pure fun’’ in the guide, and so we thought sod it, why not. In all fairness it was actually much better than both of us anticipated, and rather than being a boring, stuffy indoor museum with a million facts to read, the place was outdoors and more of a railway graveyard than a museum. This was great as the inner kid came out in us both as we climbed on-board the old trains and played with the controls (I probably did this a little more than Donna if truth be told!) Not long after we
Donna playing on the train
had begun jumping on the trains and taking photos it happened…….

….. I said something to Donna that I have never said to her in all the 15 years we have been together and which I’m hoping I won’t have to repeat anytime soon. I can’t go into too much detail as Donna insists this is in bad taste (I of course disagree), but you’ll get the idea from this one comment I made not long after excitedly jumping off train number 4 and feeling a grumble in my stomach that required some immediate attention ….

Mike: ‘’Man that was way too close, and it was proper grim in there. Gonna need to replace what’s left of those Calvins’’

Sooooo, moving on from that picture I have no doubt sadly ingrained in your head now, we decided to snap out of our moods and concentrate on our next destination, Hampi.

If the rumours were true of this place, it would be a far cry from city life and would be somewhere we wouldn’t regret coming to. This sounded promising.

Hampi, turn these frowns upside down please!

The LONGEST day of my life

Who knew it was possible to experience one day for more than twenty-four hours???

Sounds impossible, but it can be done and I have lived it! I lived 30 hours of July 20, 2013. It started out in Bangalore, India and ended in Chicago, Illinois, USA.

Leaving was bittersweet. I enjoyed my time in India, but I missed the United States and the people I love back there. It was a nice experience to undergo and I am very glad I participated. I am very glad I went to the Taj Mahal and was able to successfully tour Delhi by myself and not get sold into the slave trade (I was so nervous for that…).

The people were phenomenal, so hospitable.

Just because the residency ended, doesn't mean the adventure did. When we left for the airport, it was almost midnight. The bus couldn't make it into the parking lot so we had to walk out to the busy street and load. This was also where we said goodbye to our WorldStrides chaperone – Cheten. We all got comfortable in our seats and I remember thinking to myself how dry my eyes were and so thankful I had taken out my contacts. I remember listening to others reflect about the experience. I thought I would just shut my eyes for a few moments (to lubricate them), but ended up falling asleep. I guess everyone pretty much crashed on the ride to the airport. Suddenly we were all awaken when the bus almost got hit by a water tanker on the expressway. By this time we were very near the airport, so I stayed awake the rest of the way. The other thing I remember thinking on the bus was how bright the lights were from the oncoming traffic in the other lane.

When we got to the airport, our luggage was unloaded and we said goodbye to our driver, Edward – phenomenal doesn't even begin to describe his driving skills, especially in the chaos we were exposed to!!! We also said goodbye to our navigator.

Before we could enter the airport, we had to show some sort of proof that we had a flight, so I showed them my printed receipt/ticket confirmation. I was one of the first who was waved through. And the security put me into a different line than my counterparts, who were waved to other lines. I got through before them and looked around and figured I would wait for them near the airline. But, someone from the airline saw me and must’ve figured I was loitering, so they brought me to the check in area for my airline. I got in the line for economy, but, then was asked to move to first class for my check in…I told the lady I was with a group, but she said, they’d be on their way and that I should check my bag. So, I did what she asked. I figured after I checked my bags, I would wait before going on to security and again, I ushered to the escalator for security. Enough was enough and I figured I would just have to catch up with the group at the gate. So, I went through customs and security quite smoothly. No waits or anything, just flew through them. When I go to the gate area, I looked around and there were still a bunch of people there waiting for the flight that was before ours, so I went back to the duty free area to wait for the gang. They were worried I got lost, so I sent the Program Manager a text that I was through and fine. It took some time, for them to catch up to me, so I am glad I didn’t wait. I am also glad I went on my own, because sometimes when in a group, it can cause security to be suspicious and I didn’t want to cause anything like that because I wanted to get home and get onto my next adventure.

My last few purchases were the India Barbie and a tuk-tuk – best part – they let me pay in $USD$!!! Did some reading and reorganizing. By the time it was time to board (around 2:30 am), I was tired. Even so, I still look a sleeping pill. Luckily, I was in a first row seat with extra leg room.

Landing in Germany was a great feeling – while it was not home, no longer were there gawks and stares as I walked through the airport. Here, I was not a creature from the nother world, but a normal person. It gave me a great sense of relief. And while I was relieved to be in the West, I really craved a shower, but I did the next best thing and freshened up in the bathroom. Thank goodness there was some time to kill. When we landed it was about 2 PM in Bangalore, 9 AM in Germany and 1 AM in the Midwest.



The flight from Germany to Chicago was more uncomfortable, but I think partly was due to the anxiousness of getting home and just wanting to be home.

15/01/16 Arrive in beautiful Pathankot for breakfast and join my Rajastan bound sleeper train @ 11am, climb aboard my favoured shelf,a chilly ride with most under big blankets, doze along before reaching Bikaner junction at midnight. 16/01/16 rough sleep the night in the station waiting room and head out at 7, check my pack into a nearby ""hotel"", walk to the Town, get in on student rate(?) impressive architecture at scale, decorative & well worth a visit just to see the weapon exhibits & cool old photos, via the post office to the bhandasar temple in the old city, return back to town and catch a 20 inr bus to Karni Mata temple 30ks from town. An irresistible trip to what's known locally as the mouse temple, local descendants of the late Karni Mata fully intend to be reincarnated as kaba (rats) to join the existing residents of which there's quite a few. Bare feet really get you in touch with this rather nibbly, sticky place. Amusingly lots of little restaurants and stalls outside but for some reason I'd lost my appetite, return to Bikaner for a very good andymurray at the evergreen restau, and grab some sleep before a 7am

This was a big day for my partner and I, as we were going to be presenting to Infosys in the afternoon. First, we had a stop at Intel.

Intel India doesn't have its own website from Intel, like 3M had, so the link is to Intel India’s website. The campus is fairly large. There we had presentations from couple of people and were given a tour of the Testing facility - pretty sweet to see all the latest and greatest tablets, smartphones, and notebooks.

Intel’s mission is to create computing technology to make life easier for everyone on the globe. They invest a lot in rsearch and design. The site we were at in Bangalore is the largest non-manufacturing site outside USA. Much insight was re-laid on how starting an office is challenge and getting the right talent needed is even more of challenge. In order to be a Fellow at Intel, a very respected position in the company, the person has to make a choice – to either follow the technical side or to follow the management side. One can only become a Fellow after making a bunch of contributions to the company and one has to be
2013-07-18 10.20.15
handpicked for it.

Many people are saying the PC is dead, but that means the market is expanding into o smartphones and tablets. The big thing here is that there must be similar experiences across devices, there must be security – so Intel must be able to get processors in all areas. While maintaining a focus on humanity – this was a very prevalent theme at every business in India the humanity aspect of business.

To focus on Humanity, Intel gives a LOT of money back to various organizations. They also have an interesting donation program. So let’s say that I work for Intel and I volunteer for 20 hrs. One week at a local charity, I would record my volunteer hours and Intel would take what I would have earned in those 20 hrs. And make a financial donation to the charity – pretty cool. This is likely a reason why Intel is so successful. Is the #2 best Company to work for the #2 Best Company (behind only Google).

Intel requires a ton of software development, but surprisingly enough they don’t just recruit from the top school. They will recruit from tier 1,2,3 level schools
2013-07-18 13.03.24
as well as they work with the universities to develop curriculum that will ensure the pipeline of new entrants into the workplace are well prepared. Because of its culture, Intel is a very sought after company and people stay at Intel for many years – there is quite a high retention rate. The part I liked best about this is they encourage global movement within the company, as expanding people’s physical boundaries, will also expand their professional boundaries making them more of an asset to a global company in the global business environment.

Even if people don’t move across the globe, they are still required to grow at Intel. There is a lot of working across time zones for project, yielding to more nontraditional working schedule. This has prompted Intel to create a more work/life balance culture, even allowing employees to work from home. Intel is able to do this because every project they undertake is clearly mapped out and key players know exactly what is expected from them, and likely when it is due. Intel has created centers for excellence which tap into cross functional divisions within the company, but around the globe. There is a lot of
2013-07-18 13.03.25
matrix reporting within the company. This allows for agile manufacturing and PMP certified office employees – which are indicative of the complex processes Intel has. Throughout the history of Intel India, the objections of the location have evolved. This location is key to working with the government and getting investment for technology, developing the organization and allowing things to group. Initially it was set up and ran much like a US office, but now it is becoming more and more its own Indian office.

The second part of our presentation dealt with Sales and Marketing. I found this to be even more fascinating. In India there is a big market for young people – India is much younger than China, but there are many deep and distinct divides. Bollywood is very popular; most are Hindi and they cater to many cultures within the country. There is a big use for using this platform for marketing and branding. Cricket is also very popular and another platform for marketing – it is also good for promoting unity. In India there are many festivals, and to have strategic marketing, it would be wise to have a presence at the festival. Other popular
2013-07-18 17.44.50
platforms for young people in India are Google+, and LinkedIn – Indians make up a big part of the user ship in these social media networks.

An interesting phenomena we learned about was how India invented the missed call. In India, a person can never be charged for an incoming phone call. This made it very easy for working class people to purchase a phone. Whenever they need to get in touch with their boss, they would call the number, let it ring once and hang up. The boss would see the missed call and call the employee back. The employee was never charged for the call.

The tablet market in India is growing fast as is the first time buyer market. Actually the first time buyer market is quite large in India. Intel divides the market into the Affluent, the Aspirers and the Strivers. PC Penetration is only 10% right now, but the buy cycle is a long time, as people often have to save up for it. Most of the people who have advanced technology in India are the globals – the early adopters. The middle class is determined to make a better life for their
2013-07-18 18.00.47
children, so they will be more often than not the core of the first time buyers. Aspirers are very cautious.

For lunch we headed to Electronic City where we were able to enjoy some pizza hut pizza. I had pepperoni and it tasted yummy. My partner and I had to eat fast so we could work on our presentation – nothing like waiting until the last minute.

Then, it was off to Infosys. Infosys is a very large technology, business consulting firm. Here, my partner and I proposed that Infosys create a department called BID – Business integration Department, where they take small companies and align them with enterprise customers who happen to be government contractors. Infosys thought it was a great idea !

Infosys is not a product company – they are a problem solving company for clients. Everything is highly regarding toward the customer relationship. Innovation to address a specific need. Business model is based upon a strategy which flows from employees to clients and then to partners. Infosys strives to be relevant to client’s needs. Payment is done per transaction and is very flexible depending up on the situation and the client and the
2013-07-18 19.05.26
services being provided. Infosys likes to have a five year strategy. Employees are in the labs and tap into the employee knowledge through the centralized system Infosys. New ideas are top down and bottom up innovation. Co-create the Centers of Excellence with clients to learn from clients

Some times with competitors in the environment, if the service requires a joint venture / collaborative effort. 97% of Infosys business comes from repetitive clients; seldom do they require new clients, because the business model is heavily reliant on relationship building. The top ten clients receive direct contact from the board. Infosys invests in talent and because to gain trust with their employees.

The US is the largest spender on IT outsourced and 80% of those employees are based in India. There is often a balancing act of going global and remaining relevant locally. Not able to crack the Chin market for a few years. Transfer money to local market and recruit local talent for employment. Very little spent on marketing but didn’t’ work in China. They had to transfer money to local markets and recruit local talent/ Very little spent on marketing but didn’t working in China. Relationship based Research
2013-07-18 20.28.23
clients. Very big on the culture and value system and competency in both. After a presentation by Infosys and video about their founding and sustainability efforts, we were given a tour of their 45 + building campus in Bangalore – the main hub for Infosys.

When we got home it was still pretty early, so I went out and did some shopping at the emporium and then bartered with some merchants. It was a LOT of fun to be able to do that. Luckily, I was fast and got in and got what I wanted for the price I was and was able to return before the monsoon hit. The hotel staff had provided us with a cocktail hour so one of the guys and I decided to partake.

Following cocktails, we were off to the Hyatt for a full 5 course Indian dinner. It was very yummy. When we returned, one of the guys had purchased some Cuban cigars and some of us enjoyed the end of our trip by smoking one. I didn’t finish mine…after that it was off to bed.

Third Day of Residency

This was probably the most interesting day of the entire trip. This day we were heading to a town (by Indian standards, city by American standards) outside of Bangalore called Mysore. There is large, beautiful palace there we were going to tour. After the tour, we had lunch and then were off to a rural village to see where some of the Selco solar panels are being utilized today.

It was about a three hour bus ride to Mysore. We made a stop halfway through to get coffee and take a bathroom break. However, in the bathroom stalls, there was no paper. We had to get the paper handed to us by the lady who looked like she was there to clean the bathroom. When I came out to wash my hands, I went to the sink that wasn’t being used at the time and she shooed me from it and made me wait for my counterpart to finish. After that she handed us paper towels to dry out hands. We walked out. She followed us and stared. I guess we were supposed to pay for her ‘services’. Understanding everyone has a place in Indian
2013-07-17 08.51.40
society and being culturally sensitive to that – fine, but seriously, I’d rather just get my own paper to wipe my butt.

We were back on the bus and onto Mysore. The drive was wonderful as we were able to see a lot of the country side. When we finally got to Mysore, we were warned about the vendors who would try to stop us – they can be very persistent. Something I found intriguing about Mysore was the prevalence of St. Philomena, a Catholic saint who has a shrine in Briggsville, WI – I pass by the turn off every time I go to the Dells.

Another thing about the Mysore Palace, is they don’t let you take any cameras or phones into the palace itself, as well, you have to take off your shoes. They allow you to take as many pictures as you want around the grounds, so Pradeep gave us some time to that.

Upon entering, I don’t think I have seen a much more beautiful palace in all the world. The murals that adorned the walls were painted in a 3-D technique, which was partly cool and partly freaking. The main room has
2013-07-17 09.13.48
such intricate designs in turquoise and other precious metals. There was furniture made out of silver and crystal. Doors with ivory inlaid in them. Various beautiful murals in every all. Marble steps, like the marble at the Tajo Mahan. Honestly, words cannot express everything, nor begin to give the reader and idea of what the palace is truly like. I guess that means you’ll have to experience it for yourself! After we left the palace, we were greeted by the street vendors. I actually saw a cool wooden car I thought Mark would like so I spent some time bargaining for it, and then noticed a little jewelry box and I bartered for that as well. Another man kept following me and wanted to sell me a fan for 500 rupee and since I had already secured my cash away, I told him I would give him whatever was in my pocket – it was only 12 rupee…he kept hassling me and I kept saying 12 rupee…Finally he agree when the bus was pulling away, but Pradeep said that was such a poor offer, he wouldn’t let me go through with it. Everyone had a good laugh at that!
2013-07-17 09.14.33

After we were done touring, we were given the opportunity to purchase SOME postcards that had pictures from the various rooms. But not many…We collected our shoes, cameras, and phones and were off to Metropole for lunch.

Metropole is clearly another high end resort, which state of the art Indian cuisine. The food was AMAZING! I ventured out and tried a little bit of everything and was glad I did. However, there wasn’t enough room at the table so I had to eat quickly!!!!

After lunch, we were off to a rural village outside of Mysore to see where the Selco solar panels are installed. This particular village worked with an NGO (I’m pretty sure, though, it was the Catholic church as the ladies who greeted us were all nuns and the picture in their buildings were all Catholic murals). They have a couple of buildings that are used for school children to study and are a part of a program called Light for Education. Basically the students each get to borrow a solar powered light every night. The lamp holds light for about four hours, so they can study at home. Every day they need to return
2013-07-17 09.14.44
to the “school” where they are provided a free meal, and more time to study with tutors. While at the school studying, their solar lamps get charged so at the end of their session they can take them home with them. Pretty neat system worked out.

In the village we were also have to enter the homes of three families that have purchased Selco solar systems to light their homes (or huts, these were more like huts). The families were very generous allowing us to enter and see the operation and how these panels make a difference in their daily lives. A truly humbling experience, as something we take for granted, light, is not always readily available.

ON the way home, we stopped at a roadside oasis for dinner – KFC, I wasn’t really hungry (I had a HUGE lunch), so I checked out the little emporium and got myself a little key chain tray. We were back on the bus again and made it home around midnight. I think we all went to bed.

The day of the residency brought more company visits and more experiences. We had breakfast as usual and boarded the bus. Pradeep, our tour guide, provided a lot of insight on the city as we were passing through in the mid-morning traffic jam.

The first company we went to visit was Selco-India. Selco is a solar panel distribution and service company that helps to bring light to the rural poor. Lots of people in the rural areas of India are without power. And those with power in the rural areas may not have the electricity from the grip. The goal is to provide energy to the rural poor. Selco offers an abundant of aftermarket services and they often will provide service to competitor’s panels as well, as often the after sales service is something that goes forgotten.

The company began in 1995, the products they sell have a 25 year warranty on them and they are expensive. Most of the people live on less than 3,000 Rupees ($50) a month and each product costs about 420 Rupees – often a bigger expense than people can afford in one go. Couple that with the difficult banking structure in India and
2013-07-16 11.59.24
it poses a real threat to getting light to the rural poor. A service that Selco offer is financial counseling. They assist people with taking about a loan and filling out the paperwork – essentially Selco helps to establish a poor person’s relationship with a bank and a credit history, which is crucial for future investments and purchases. The way Selco is able to do this is by recruiting retired loan officers to donate their time and knowledge of the industry. In this regard, Selco is not the creditor or backer of the loan, but the networking piece of the puzzle to bring the two factions together. Something important to note, is that the default rate on loans to the poorest of the poor is virtually nonexistent.

After sales support is a big revenue generator for Selco. It also helps to establish trust with the customer, and when the trust builds, the confidence in utilizing solar energy also increases.

The mission of Selco is to remain focused on the rural poor. About 80% of their product line of solar energy is for light and the other 20% is for heating. In the past they have tried to develop
Photo Jul 15, 22 58 02
a reliable cook stove, but it never proved to be very reliable, so that is something they try to stay away from. As far as their market make up, 75% of the market is the rural poor or the handicraft makers and the other 25% are some rural institutions (think NGOs). Selco prefers NOT to serve the institutions, but understands, in some regions this is the best way to enter into a rural area that have virtually been left untapped before. When a cash paying customer comes to Selco, they will in turn service them, but that customer is not given priority in the business model’s current state. Another reason to remain focused on the rural poor is to help these people who are completely left out of the economy, enter into the economy with a positive credit history – it goes beyond just providing light for Selco.

When it comes to Marketing and Sales, there is a small budget and the majority of the marketing is done informally. Occasionally, there will be news coverage of what Selco is doing and they try to capitalize on that as best they can.

The next place we go to visit
Photo Jul 16, 4 51 48
was 3M India. The building we were in was the R&D building for 3M India. Very odd experience for me because 3M – Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, was essentially founded in my backyard and I had never been there. Now, here I am, half a world away and getting to see something that sprung up from my hometown. Another thing odd about the experience is I know people who work at R&D in St. Paul, MN and their locations are TOP Secret – even their spouses cannot know where they work, nor their product lines, so to be at the R&D center of 3M India was a very contradictory feeling for me.

The HR team was our first main contacts and they provided a little bit of back ground on the company and the high regard 3m places on innovation. They talked about the Littman Stethoscope, Post its, Scotch Tape, etc. Investment into R&D is HUGE at 3M. Another thing that is big with 3M is mix and matching technologies to create new uses. Take something learned from Posits, alter it slightly with Scotch Tape and now there is a completely new product and new opportunity to exploit. Something to
Photo Jul 16, 0 41 29
clarify about my experience, is this location only works on R&D for the Indian market only – products seen there might not be seen in the US or elsewhere in the world. One such product was the 3M Car Care shops that help to service the vehicles on the road. The was something very different, but at the same time, I totally think it could work in other markets.

The vision of 3M is in alignment with its foundation and there is a thriving environment of cultural innovation. There are also some things called Customer Technical Centers which have over 60K products that customers can give direct feedback to 3M on. At 3M, the individual initiative is crucial to the success of the employee, and the company. Personal ability to be independent and the ability to thrive in ambiguity are two characteristics 3M looks for in hiring.

Research is the transformation of money into knowledge and innovation is the transformation of knowledge into money. Within 3M there is a mantra of the 3-touch rule. If an employee comes to a problem, they should be able to find a solution after contacting three people in the ENTIRE Company. To
2013-07-16 14.05.31
me, this is an unspoken way of saying communication is key to 3M’s success. An often time in the corporate world people like withhold information and not communicate living by the mantra of knowledge is power and he with the knowledge has the power. My inference from the visit at the 3M-India is that is defiantly NOT the case.

Another part of the core of the 3M is crossfuncitonal teams. The business will prioritize projects based upon resources and money, and it is up to the teams to manage the expectations of the business and the customer. Another part of this is also managing people. People often work on a more than one project at any given time, so prioritizing their work and their projects based upon a balance of customer demand and business priorities. According to 3M this is a fine line to walk and balance, and people can get sensitive if their projects are further developed. Often time’s project will reach a certain point and get killed for one reason or another.

Once our tour was done, we were served lunch. Our lunch that does was Domino’s pizza – but it wasn’t the same flavors that
Photo Jul 16, 0 55 46
we have in the US. Mind you that most Indians are vegetarians, so no meat. There were four different pizzas. The toppings were: Corn, Green Pepper, Eggplant and variety of vegetables with onions. Surprisingly the sauce was pretty much the same.

After we left 3M, we were on our way to Whitefield – a posh area outside the city of Bangalore filled with gated communities and expats. The reason we would be going there was to have dinner with our professor and her family. But, first we had to stop off for a little shopping.

We went to a mall, which by a Minnesotan’s standards was a true mall. All the buildings in one roof with stable stores on the corners. This mall was about four stories high, but wasn’t as big in diameter as say, Mall of America. Another difference was, in order to enter the mall, we all had to go through security, and do the same thing when we exited. There were some familiar stores – ADIAS, but a lot of the stores were different, selling some Western stuff and some Indian stuff. The mall wasn’t very busy, but, it was, after all, a work
2013-07-16 11.29.34
day during working hours. On the fourth floor there was a wine bar – but it wasn’t opened. I am sure if a bunch of us wanted to go in, we could have gotten them to open early, but that was just not the case. The guys were more into a couple of the arcade games.

Outside of the mall was a cricket batting cage, so we all gave it a shot – including me who was wearing a dress that day. I didn’t complete miff every shot; I made contact with the ball a few times. It was sort of fun. Maybe people who are more into baseball would enjoy cricket, but I really don’t. When I was in London my supervisor in Parliament was a HUGE cricket fan. Every day have lunch we had to watch if for about 2-3 hours while we processed paperwork and stuff – such boring sport. And whereas Baseball can go on and on for innings, Cricket can go on and on for DAYS!!!!

After the mall, we made our way to our professor’s home. Actually, it was the home of her sister and her sister’s family, but this is where
2013-07-16 14.33.44
our professor stays when she is in India. They served up some appetizers and coke. Then we were fed a traditional southern Indian meal. This was followed up by some conversation. One of the guys, who are OBSESSED, with motorcycles was given an opportunity to ride a two-wheeler through the streets of the neighborhood (these are not as congested as inner city Bangalore). After some conversation, our professor’s mother blessed each of us and provided us all with a little gift, which was way more than necessary, but we all graciously accepted. We ate pretty late, so it made for a late return back to the hotel.

Global Residency in India

Monday morning was the first day of our residency. The

morning began fairly early with breakfast at the hotel. There was an assortment
of different foods – Western, Indian and everything in between. While I wasn’t
sick, my stomach was beginning to gurgle, so I stuck to a more conservative
breakfast. Although my favorite thing was the papaya. I also had some
watermelon juice and BACON!!!! Seriously! They had BACON! This was probably the
most pleasant surprise one could find in India for breakfast – BACON!!!! Yum!

We all piled into the bus and were off to the first company -

Mytrah.
Mytrah is a wind energy company that has an office in Bangalore, India. They work
off of independence power producer wind farms. Many of the obstacles that
Mytrah faces deals with regulation as the fossil fuel companies have many more
financial resources and can hire many lobbyists. In 2003 India passed an
initiative called the Rules of Electricity Act which was trying to promote the
electricity sector and wind farms, like Mytrah took advantage of this law.

In India, the energy industry is essentially regulated by the

government. There
2013-07-15 09.18.06
is the central government that has regulations that everyone
must abide by and then there are state governments which pass their own
legislation as well.

Another issue that Mytrah faces deals with forecasting. In

order to help better predict and manage wind energy forecasts, Mytrah have
looked to the US, UK and Spain to understand how their models of forecasting
work. Although very difficult to obtain, Mytrah is also looking for legal
solutions to forecasting and scheduling. Wind servers that are used to help
predict usually only obtain the direction, speed and some satellite data
regarding wind energy ups and down.

Furthermore, another obstacle is the tropical climate.

Temperatures are very high and wind is not predictable. This instability in
climate temperature is what makes looking to the West for understanding
difficult. Spain and the UK have very
steady climates. While the US has a variety of climates within the country’s
political borders, the climates are fairly stable within the various
geographical regions.

A possible remedy to the instability of wind energy is to

potentially tap into batteries. However, batteries make not be the best
solution as they can be expensive and have a
2013-07-15 09.18.07
variety of limitations. The Act
from 2003 is very important as the judicial system is very good in India, so
when the laws are not amiable, the judicial route with appeals is a lucrative
option. However, this can be very costly – both in terms of time and money.

Some key take a ways from the meeting with Mytrah was that

the land laws are difficult to lead with in India and not very transparent.
Regulatory knowledge in all areas is imperative to success as well as a great
understanding of the political system with in the country. The best way to
break into the Indian market is through partnerships. Contracts, especially the
way the US deals with contracts, are not a very flexible way to conduct
business. It is important to be flexible and utilize regional strategies as
India is a very diverse nation. Frugal innovation is also important in India.
Finally, one must be patient in India, whether it’s driving down the street or
conducting business – things don’t just happen overnight.

After our meeting, while we were walking out we happened upon

the inauguration of additional office space for Mytrah. There was a
2013-07-15 09.19.37
Hindi priest,
a statue of a god, and, of course, jasmine. There were some prayers that were
said for the prosperity of the company and this location. It was very
interesting to see all the men, and some women, who came to join the
inauguration. After it was over, they passed around some sweets. Boy! Were
those ever sugary – sweeter than sweet and much sweeter than I expected. We
then left the building and made our way back to the hotel where we had lunch as
a group.

After lunch was a lecture by a man who used to work for John

Deere in Pune. I thought his lecture was more insightful and genuine, as he
really wasn’t talking about a particular business, but provided more of a
framework for understanding India – the culture and the way to do business
there. To provide a bit of a historical perspective – India was becoming a
colony of the British Empire when the United States was becoming independent.
Prior to that, India was part of the Mughal Empires – the Hindus were a very
assimilative people, as often their rulers were Muslim and the subjects were
Hindus. In
2013-07-15 11.56.16
some way the British rule was positive for India – Britain brought
railroads, infrastructure, a common language, education, etc. to India.
However, though it was negative in that the British exploited the resources
from India and it created a huge psychological effect on Indians that they were
inferior even in their own country.

Six dimensions are very important to Indian society. They

are: Caste, Class, Language, Religion, Region and Gender. Each of these dimensions
plays a crucial role in the people of India. To understand the people, it is
important to know that people are creative and passionate and this transposes
to the work place as well. It is this passion that drives Indians to work hard;
as well as the PHD effect – Poor, Hungry & Determined. Growth in India is
difficult and when conducting business, that is something to grasp. Much
emphasis is placed on CRM (Customer Relationship Management) – the
understanding that human beings are emotional creatures and being able to
leverage that emotional understanding also becoming important for conducting
business in India. There is a higher purpose to business than just making
money. Some other advice was to leverage India, figure out the growth
2013-07-15 11.57.51
need and
leverage: the market, manufacturing, talent, sourcing and optimize cost – make
sure to group markets on types of markets NOT on region (which is a tendency in
Western business practice).

To conclude, the speaker showed a video about the Aravind Eye Hospital. The clinic was begun

in 1977 with the mission of eliminating avoidable blindness from the world. The
idea was to train doctors to perform basic ocular screenings in a standardized
fashion, thus copying the McDonald’s model of fast and cheap service. At
Aravind, if a person cannot pay, they are not pressured to; however, if they
can pay, they are asked to pay twice to cover someone else’s surgery. The
clinic has grown to be so successful, that many doctors from world renowned
universities (Oxford, Harvard, etc.) send students there to study the practice.
A truly inspiring story of how one person really can make a difference.

After the speaker, we were finally given some time to go

shopping!!! Wa-Hoo!!! We left the hotel as one big group. And made our way past
some nice retail shops and the emporium and some market-type stores (where
bargaining was ok). Eventually, our Program manager began to
2013-07-15 11.58.05
trust some guy who
wanted to bring us to an open market as the sun was beginning to set. My gut
was telling me something was wrong with this, and some of the others must have
felt the same thing, because a bunch of us decided to turn around – we didn’t
want to get lost on our first day in Bangalore.

On our way back, we stopped at the emporium. The emporium is

a government-run marketplace. The prices are set, so no bargaining. The quality
tends to be a little higher, so the prices are higher than those you would find
on the streets. I found some things I really liked, but wasn’t willing to
purchase everything in one night. I made a mental note of what I wanted, so I
knew to save my money – if I did in fact determine it was necessary. For
dinner, we all decided to go to McDonald’s and get a value meal. Most of the meals
are vegetarian, but opted for the Chicken McNuggets – again, I didn’t want to
tempt fate with getting sick eating unfamiliar food. After dinner, the group
split up – about half of us
2013-07-15 13.57.14
went back to the hotel and the other half kept
shopping. Believe it or not, I went back. It was dark and I was getting to feel
very uncomfortable. One of the guys needed to stop at the ATM, so we waited. As
we waiting a beggar with a baby came up to us and kept grabbing at us. I was
pretty persistent about her leaving me alone and she seemed to get the message.
However, none of the guys were as persistent and it made for a very awkward
encounter. IN situations like that, I tend to live by the mantra of be firm,
confidence and say NO, also try to not make eye contact and it usually works
best.

After a crazy filled day, it

was back to the hotel for catching some Zzz’s and starting the process
all over again.

MTU Sign for me
On Sunday morning, I had to wake up at 4 am to finish packing and take a shower and checkout. This time, since I was just flying to Bangalore to meet the group, I packed a bunch of extra stuff that was previously in my carry on into my larger bag. I was nervous it would be too heavy. My driver was early which was a relief! It was still dark out and the drive was quite peaceful. There were no other cars on the road. An occasional truck here and there, but nothing else on the road - very different to see. The driver made good time to the airport. Upon arrival, I had to check in through ‘foreign’ lines. It was sort of nice b/c there weren’t many foreigners. I was then able to get my Boarding pass and according to the airline’s scale my bag was still underweight! Again, at security checkpoint, I was put through to the foreigner lane. I found my gate right away and went to get coffee. When I returned to the gate, they started boarding early.

The flight was pretty empty. I was seated in the emergency exit row which was nice
2013-07-14 10.31.52
Jasmine garland
because I was able to stretch out more. A man from a few rows back moved up and sat on the aisle seat – leaving the middle seat open. We talked and I found out that he was an architect. He is the lead architect who works for Bacardi – designed all the Bacardi lounges located in international airports. The breakfast on the flight was one of the best I had on this trip to date. After breakfast, I took a nap and when I woke up I was in Bangalore.

My first impression of Bangalore was that the airport was one of the nicest I have ever been in. The baggage was sent to the claim right away. I walked out the door and found my driver right away. I had two people – a driver and a navigator. The first thing I noticed was my driver had an extra thumb; I did my best not to stare. Both of the guys were fairly young, early 20’s, but they were very helpful and talkative. The car had some jasmine in it and it is absolutely fragrant. Lots of jasmine garlands and what hot. I noticed a lot of
2013-07-14 10.31.56
Jasmine in the marketplace
Catholic influences. And it turned out the owner of their company was Catholic.

As we were driving into the city they were telling me all about it. About how Bangalore used to be so lovely with lots of gardens, but urban sprawl has set in. Another thing we discussed were weddings, given mine is just around the corner. The navigator’s sister recently got married and because of their class and caste it was a four day event with around 1200 people. They also talked about the jasmine can be found everywhere. Jasmine is very fragrant flower and Indians will twine it into garland. At the beginning of a marriage, a husband will often bring jasmine for his wife to wear in her hair. Some other things they showed me were where the gardens used to be and some of the good places to shop – not that I would get there, but it was nice of them. Finally, we arrived at the hotel. The traffic was heavy and congested by American standards, but was fairly light compared to New Delhi.



When I arrived at the hotel, I had to go through security, and checked in. The
2013-07-14 10.47.35
service was really impressive – they didn’t let me lift a finger. My room was 305 and I was rooming with the other female in the program. In order to get to our room, we had to put our room key in the reader on the lift - which would only let me go to the third floor. My roommate had arrived with the rest of the group around 2 am in in the morning, so she was already in the room. We were all getting ready to meet our driver and guide and to explore the city. We had our lunch at the hotel before we left.

When it was time to go, we all shuffled on to the coach bus which had been provided to us as a part of our program in India. We met our guide – Pradeep, our driver – Edward, and then we also had a navigator. Pradeep had a colorful personality and was full of historical knowledge, linguistic knowledge, religious knowledge, etc. Our first stop was the Botanical Gardens, which were originally set up by the British. It was nice having the guide because then all the beggars left us alone. The
2013-07-14 19.01.31
walk through the gardens was delightful. We saw a lot of different vegetation and beautiful flowers.

We got on the bus, and drove to another part of the city. There we walked through a little marketplace with lots of colors from the fruit stands and the flower stands. Everything was very bright and colorful.

We came to another park and then were led to a Bull Temple. It was very interesting to see, but even though the guide explained the significance of it, I still didn’t understand much of the significance. After we left the temple, we stumbled upon some street vendors. Some of the people were brave enough to try to drink the coconut milk. I decided to get some earrings and a little souvenir for a friend. Our next stop was at the remains of a palace that stood in the city. We did some more sightseeing from the bus – definitely could see all the massive amounts of humanity 😉 ! After a few hours we were headed back to our hotel. Our dinner was just down the road from our hotel. It was a traditional style Indian restaurant. LOTS of good food and good
2013-07-14 11.03.59
wine. It was a nice kick start to our residency. After dinner, we walked back to the hotel and got ready for the week. It was nice to have a shower.

orange county, coorg
My first ever trip to Bangalore and to South India was in the year 2006 for an induction programme with the multinational organisation i had joined. I do recall the HAL airport and that it was small and not being able to cope with the pressure of Bangalore having emerged as the Silicon valley of India. We left for the training facility and it was part of a sprawling over 100 acre property where the corporate office used to be. I remember the weather to be cold and raining, this was in November and I had dinner and called it a day. I was sharing my room with another manager and she arrived in the middle of the night and scared me out of my wits. The next day our induction began and I think we may have been there for a few days, 3 nights at the most. One of the evenings with my new found friend and a few others we caught auto rickshaws and left for MG Road, a long winding ride through narrow heavily clogged roads with traffic and construction to reach after almost an hour or so. We dined on burgers from a fast food joint
bylakuppe
and met up with my brother's friend there. We caught auto rickshaws back and this time it was a bit better. Later I got to know that we were staying at Brookefield near Whitefield and it was a different part of the town from MG Road. One of the evenings we dined at an Andhra joint nearby, all of us sharing the meal. We explored the lobby of the erstwhile corporate office and besides being grand and resembling a lobby of a palace it had this gigantic Hussain painting strapped to the wall. The last day group photographs were taken and it was time to come back.

The next trip was with our own division and we were driving down to Coorg for a conference cum outbound. I still remember the flight from Mumbai being very scary, our entire team was on it and we met winds of crazy speeds while trying to land at the airport. Unfortunately we were not able to land and the winds pushed us off the runway and we had to come around for another landing. Needless to say everyone on board was scared but the second time round we managed to land. I was at this point of time based out of the guest house in Mumbai and hence was on the flight originating in Mumbai. We arrived in Bangalore and I remember meeting up with the rest of the team at a dinner somewhere from where we left for our guest house in Indiranagar. It was a lovely guest house and I had one of the terrace rooms with a lovely open terrace with it.

The next day early morning we left for Coorg stopping at Kamats for breakfast. There is a quaint store in Kamats from where I picked up wooden bangles and we left for Coorg. On the way we worked on our presentations and after a round of nerve wracking presentations and head bashing sales analysis we decided to get some sightseeing done. We were staying at the Orange County and had a lovely villa all to ourselves with a pool at the back. In the evening we explored the grounds a bit and watched the Kodavu tribal dance. The buffet lunches and dinners were lavish and extensive. The next day we left for the Dubare elephant camp and saw elephants being bathed by the Cauvery river. We also went to Bylakuppe where there is a Tibetan settlement. I bought a mobile accessory for myself and my colleague in the Kolkata office and then it was time to drive back to Bangalore.

I was staying back for one more day before which I would leave for Mumbai with rest of the team. One of my assignments was to connect with a leading fashion person in the city and I did so before leaving for Mumbai. At Coorg I also picked up a leather pouch from the store at Orange County.

The next time we were in Bangalore we had an event to organise and it's a different story that the event went out of hand, tempers flared, last moment damage control had to be exercised and somehow we salvaged the situation and the many egos involved. One of the days I dated someone and we dined at Little Italy at Indiranagar and on another day met the same friend and had dinner at 100 Ft road, a Boutique restaurant. After the event at the poolside of the Park, we met up at this exotic restaurant in Indiranagar for a fashion show and it was heartbreaking for me to see the same celebrity organise a far more eclectic event. From here we left for Chennai for the second leg of the journey where unfortunately tempers flared again and all in all I have such mixed feelings of this event.

My last trip to Bangalore would be sometime in the middle of 2007,this time with another event. We had a tough time organising the event at Garuda Mall and altercations with the management occurred before we could proceed again. Luckily for me this time it wasn't my fault at all. It was my boss'. We had a team lunch at a restaurant at Garuda Mall, I shopped a bit at the Home Stop and at Garuda Mall and we stayed over at my colleague's place at Richmond Road. The next morning i left for Kolkata, I had managed to convince my bosses to let me go back to Kolkata again and develop the market there. Still remember the shot glasses and Dunhill deo I picked up for my brothers. The store at Homestop was amazing, it was massive and had this classy and elegant collection of home items. After moving to Bangalore it was here that I would spend so many happy hours. Every time I entered the Garuda Mall it would remind me of the day the mall management fought with us and disconnected our electric connection. Over the years that memory too has dimmed and paled. I also visited the Nallis shop, then on MG Road with the area manager from South and chose this lovely green South Indian saree for my mum. The company owned salon was on Richmond Road and that would be our base. We would walk down once for lunch at a Chinese restaurant and I would be amazed at the cosmopolitan nature of the city and some lovely salons, very high end. In those days we didn't have the new airport and neither did we have the UB City all of which have added to the style quotient of the city. My boss wanted to shop at Forum Mall and I remember going there once and finding it very crowded. After moving here all these places would be my haunt and how happy I would be being the mall rat that I am.

So I pestered and pestered my hubby for a quick break before my medicals begin again. Yes I am in the middle of some medical complications but enough of that. Hubby has booked a deluxe room at the Taj Madikeri, Coorg and am so excited. Watch this space for more!!

What to have for dinner is a question which always leaves you in trouble. And dealing with such questions is quiet difficult. And in such situations agreeing of everyone is important!!

And weekend it was; my parents, my brother, my sister and I were sitting together and playing cards. We all were having a great time as the game was becoming interesting, when out of nowhere I just recommended that we can go to Chokhi Dhani today. With least interest in what I said everybody said “Okay” because everybody’s attention seeker at that point of time was that card game. But our Chokhi Dhani plan was executed also.

So we all went to Chokhi Dhani. It was quiet far from our house but drive was fun indeed. We finally reached the place – and the food turned out to be awesome. The food of Chokhi Dhani which we always use to talk about which is very famous in Jaipur maintained the same standard and taste in Bangalore also.

Now you must be thinking that how costly could this Chokhi Dhani could be? Not at all costly guys, they have very nominal charges in which you get not only food but get to see really nice dances and activities.

P1080143
Days 221 - 225 (Tues 16th – Sat 20thApril) Bangalore



A very early start for me being around 7am to give me time to get showered and to the station in Chennai to head onwards to Bangalore. The trip took around 6 hours and it’s safe to say that the second class seating is not comfortable at all. It certainly isn’t as good as a virgin voyager service back home.

I arrived mid afternoon and got into a taxi and headed out to my guesthouse. Obviously being the way here the taxi driver took me saying he knew where it was when he didn’t. After a phone call to the guesthouse I waited for a couple of minutes with the taxi driver and a bloke on a motorbike turned up to take me to the right place.

After waiting 10 minutes for someone to attend the reception, if you can call it that I got my room. In the evening I headed into town and towards the cricket ground, around 4km from the guesthouse. Luckily Bangalore is nowhere near as hot as Chennai was yesterday so it’s far more manageable. After stopping in a local place
P1080145
for some food I got to the ground to be told there was no ticket office open and it was sold out. I walked around for 30 minutes or so asking all sorts of people about tickets. When I thought I wasn’t going to get in I was approached by a man with a ticket selling for face value. I felt this was a bit sketchy so I agreed to pay on being let in which I did. The game was great, produced a super over to end it and was well worth the 1200 rupees I paid.

I had a strange experience on the way home. I was maybe ¾ of the way back when a scooter pulled along side of me, this now being 12:30am and stopped. The guy started talking to me asking where I was from, why I was here and where I was staying, I answered the first 2 but definitely not the last one. Then I was asked if I wanted his company for the night. After laughing and telling him to do one I carried on my way back to my guesthouse. I’ve plenty of girls offered to me in various cities
P1080148
from China, Philippines and Thailand etc but I’ve never had a man offer his services. I think the fact I started laughing showed I was not interested and he left pretty sharpish.

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday followed pretty much the same routine. Every morning I headed into town to the cricket ground. First day the tickets were not on sale, the second day they were but were very pricey so I left it and thought I could buy online instead. The third day I realised I couldn’t buy online and had to purchase from the ticket office, paying 3300, way more than I’d planned or wanted to pay but at the end of the day I am in India for the IPL so I accepted it and paid it.

The afternoons of these days I pretty much wandered the streets, with no plan in mind to hopefully find something to do or things to see. There is not much to do, that would take up time but there are plenty of impressive buildings in the city. The main things online to do are a water park and snow centre which don’t interest me at all. I spent my
P1080149
evenings eating in the local curry houses and watching the IPL on the tv in my room. Without a tv in my room I may have been a little lost as Bangalore hasn’t a nightlife.

I did get to the stage where I was struggling with the bathroom situation. There was no toilet roll in Bangalore it seemed. As I was running very very short and was out walking one day a great idea crossed my mind. I walked past a pharmacy and saw nappies so figured they’d sell baby wipes. Luckily they did. I did however look a bit of a plank walking through the city centre where I was getting stared at any ways, but this time with a large pink bag of baby wipes. I imagine they all knew exactly what it was for.

Whilst I was in Bangalore on I think the Wednesday there was a terrorist bomb planted which exploded and injured some 16 people. This happened a couple kilometres from my accommodation and you could sort of tell the city was a little bit cautious after that. Luckily they didn’t postpone the cricket on the Saturday night which they were considering.
P1080156

On Saturday I got all my stuff packed and ready to go then headed into town for food followed by the cricket. I needn’t have bothered with the food as I was in a corporate stand and food was served between innings. I gave it a swerve as I was still stuffed and instead had my 2 free Kingfisher’s instead, the first time I’d seen alcohol in India, 5 days in!! It never takes this long in a country. There were no dodgy encounters on my way home this evening so that made the walk home far more straightforward.



Days 226 - 230 (Sun 21st – Thurs 25th April) Chennai



This morning I headed back to Chennai, I wasn’t looking forward to the trip as I didn’t enjoy the 6 hours on the way here, but it turned out not to be to bad. I had the usual fun and games when I arrived in Chennai around 2pm. Flocks of taxi and auto-rickshaw drivers asking me where I wanted to go etc. I got one sorted, showed him the address on my ipod and we proceeded to not be able to find it as
P1080157
commonly practised here. It turns out my hotel was on a little side street of a 23km long road so lucky to find it.

The rickshaw driver decided to help himself to 50 rupees more than we’d agreed. Ok it’s only like 60 pence sterling but he wouldn’t give me the arranged price as we had to drive around the block 3 times. I tried to tell him that at the station he said he knew where it was. He was having none of it. He even came into the hotel and told the owner that he couldn’t find it. I always manage to pick absolute planks to drive me about. If I had small bills I’d have paid what we agreed but I didn’t so he short changed me. I accepted that I wasn’t getting my correct change and headed in. Dropped all my gear of and walked to the stadium to buy tickets for the 2 games while I am in town this time. 750 rupees which is great compared to Bangalore. In the evening whilst sat in the lobby met a lad called Leo who was also going to the cricket so agreed we’d head there
P1080159
together and hang our during the day.

On Monday and Tuesday I pretty much hanged out with Leo, a lad from the Isle of Wight who’s been in India since early January, on my first impressions that’s far longer than I would like to stay here. We spent most of the 2 days just chilling in either the huge mall just around the corner or relaxing in our hotel rooms watching tv. On Monday night we went to the game. It turned out to be an absolute cracker and one of the best T20 games of the season. Not bad considering it was Leo’s first ever game of any sport. Leo left late on Tuesday so the rest of my time would be spent back on my own.

On Wednesday I decided to do some major walking around town. It was about 36 degrees and very humid but I managed a good 3 hours walking around town before I felt knackered. I wandered to Fort George which is just an army base and not impressive. Also down to the sea front where there is a lot nicer area. I think it was called Anna Square. It’s obviously one
P1080162
of the nicer spots in town as its full of people, still no other tourists though. I’ve hardly seen any white folk in my 2 weeks or so here, it’s a bit off putting as locals just stare permanently at me. It seems a lot easier place to be when you have company. It doesn’t seem to bother me as much when the stares are aimed at 2 people as opposed to 1. I thought India would be a bit more used to white people than it seems. I got less stares in China.

Thursday I just enjoyed that I had probably the nicest room I’ve had in a while and lay in bed until early afternoon when I went to the cinema to watch Oblivion, Tom Cruise’s new film. After being pretty much completely baffled by the storyline I headed out to watch my final match in Chennai. Another home win and top class performance topped of a good few days in Chennai, I feel like I am enjoying India a bit more than I was although I’m still not hugely keen on it, there just doesn’t seem a lot to do here which is a shame considering
P1080166
I’ve been in 2 cities that have 8 and 9 million people in them. Plus the heat and more importantly humidity are killing me any time I go outside. I struggle in a Manx summer let alone and Indian one.

Thar Desert
I looked up at my camel towering over me with its long legs, knobbly knees and giant teeth and before I could object I was being hoisted up and over the saddle. Will and I began our camel trek, accompanied by two locals, into the Thar desert near the Pakistani border.



Once I'd adjusted to the height - the ride was surprisingly comfortable until my guide let go of the reigns and my camel started wandering off in its own direction leaving only me to guide it! We stopped to set up camp in the desert. As our guide lit a fire and began cooking, we sat and watched our camels munch on seed with their huge jaws; white foamy saliva emerging from their mouths with every chew.




As darkness fell, the main guide left to go and stay in a nearby village, leaving us with a young boy of only about 16, but he reassured us everything would be OK. I was suddenly awoken in the night to find a camel towering above my head, eating the remaining food left on the ground right next to us! We both jumped up and realised
Camel Festival
that the camel had escaped from where it had been tied up on the other side of our camp. Will grabbed hold of the food bag to move it away but by doing so he angered the camel who then started to chase him. We called out for Ali (the young boy) but he was nowhere to be seen. Too scared to go back we had to leave the camp without even enough time to put on my shoes. We walked in the dark to a nearby camp in the hope their guide could help get our camel under control. After awkwardly waking them up, we managed to phone our guide who said he would be there as soon as he could from the village. As we cautiously walked back to camp Will's camel was still eating the food and in all the commotion: mine had also escaped and was now roaming around freely. It turned out Ali had decided to go with his friends to the set of a Bollywood film on a desert dune in th distance, a rare event from what we could gather. They soon had the camels under control but we definitely slept with one
Camel Racing
eye open for the rest of the night!




The next morning we rode our camels across the desert (Lawrence of Arabia style) to a camel festival, hosting camel races for the locals.

Bangalore
view from a rooftop restaurant
Hey again,

So....I made it to India in one piece. Erica and I spent the last night in Amsterdam with our two friends and got on the plane at 5 am the next day. We met up with Robyn, another girl in our program, in Paris, where we met at the gate for our flight to Bangalore. Everything went fine until Paris, where we were stuck on the tarmack for three hours because of technical difficulties with the plane. Not an encouraging thing to happen just before a 9 hour flight. However, we landed in Bangalore safely, and spent the night at a family owned hotel near the airport.

Now, this is where the networking began. We talked with the wife of the hotel owner in the morning and she had connections in the city which is an hour from the airport area. She arranged for her friend George who was a friend of a friend who knew somebody who had a membership at the catholic club which was basically like a YMCA with a pool and cheap food. Very safe. Perfect. So, we shacked up there for 4 nights and the next day slept in til 1 pm!!!
Sultans Burial Place
near Mysore
Talk about jet lag. We then spent the afternoon finishing our final papers and hanging out near the pool. Hard life I know. Then we bought traditional Indian dresses called salwar kameez and wore them to dinner to celebrate the end of another semester.

The heat here is insanely hot. I just came from - 1 degrees celsius in Amsterdam and it is literally 40 degrees in Bangalore with the humidity. My poor Scottish, Danish ancestry has given me the weakest capacity to deal with heat of this kind.

The next day we hired a taxi driver to take us to Mysore, my old stomping grounds, where I lived at the age of thirteen and my whole journey towards working in Global Health began. We visited the palace, the Chamundi hills, ate masala dosa and butter chicken at my old time favorite restaurant, which has since been renovated, but which still exists!! We then visited a few temples and shrines dedicated to dead sultans, and made our way back to Bangalore, stopping only for coconuts and chikoo (small brown fruit that tastes like a mix between a prune and a pear) along the side of the road. We
Palace
Mysore
arrived in Bangalore just in time for rush hour traffic which meant we were stuck in hot, dusty, loud traffic for about 2 hours longer than we should have been. After a long day, we passed out almost immediately when we got back.

From Bangalore we headed to Kerala by plane, to a place called Cochi, which is a little fishing village on the outskirts of brackish water canals that loop in and out of floating villages. They call it the Venice of India: I would argue that it is even more beautiful than Venice, having been there myself a few years ago. I came to Kerala with my mom when I was thirteen, and I have to say, although there is much more development than there used to be, I felt very nostalgic as I walked along the fishing shore and saw the very familiar chinese fishing nets, and the fisherman selling all types of fish and seafood. The three of us bought fish and prawns, and a local restaurant cooked it for us in garlic and butter. Cheap as chips, as they say. And delicious it was!!

Next, we got sarees made (another traditional Indian dress) made of Keralan silk, and we ventured over to a cultural center where we saw traditional Kathakali dancing, which is basically theater dance with large, heavy intricate costumes, and detailed eye movements which convey emotion, rather than actual acting. It is a very cool thing to see, and I would recommend seeing it if you can.

Next we made our way to an elephant sanctuary where we made friends with a baby elephant and watched elephants bathing in the water. Very cool. The rest of our time was spent on the backwaters exploring small villages and taking in the view from the water of the women on shore making string out of coconut husks, which, unlike the way it used to be when I was here ten years ago, is supplemented by the government, which gives these women machines which helps to increase the production of string.

Kerala was probably the hottest place we went to. After about a week in Karnataka state and then Kerala, we ventured to Goa, where we ended up staying for five days. Palolem beach is my favorite beach in India, aside from a place called Gokarna. I was afraid that it would have been ruined by tourism in the last ten years, and although again, there was much more development that before, it is off-season for tourists, so the beach was not busy, and it was JUST as I remembered it. I was home again in some small way, which may sounds weird, but makes perfect sense to me. I think my mom and brother would understand what I mean...

After two weeks of traveling for pleasure, balancing headphone parties and fire dancing/poy on the beach with trying to find internet occasionally to let people know we were alive or finish final papers and assignments, we arrived in Manipal. We are staying in an all girls residence which is very clean and safe, although we have a curfew, and I feel like I am 5 years old again. I guess the university used to have problems with alcohol, drugs, and public displays of affection, so they have really cracked down and made things a lot more conservative around here. I will be here for two weeks working with students from all over the world, and I will start fieldwork at an ART center (anti-retroviral treatment) at the state hospital in Udupi district. I will work with HIV positive patients and health workers to investigate issues associated with the side effects of taking anti-retroviral drugs. I am so excited to have this practical experience, and I cant wait to report on how it goes. I will report back when I can. I can’t believe I only have two weeks left before I am back in Canada! Talk to you soon,

Asia » India » Karnataka » Mysore
April 19th 2013
Published: April 19th 2013


Our second placement weekend was spent in the beautiful city of Mysore, (mistakenly pronounced by Ali as ‘Mee-sore’ much to the amusement of our Indian housemates) a three hour bus ride away from Ashwini. We stayed in a hotel 3km outside the centre claimed by the Lonely Planet as ‘the nicest hostel in all of India’. Not convinced by this statement but if nothing else it definitely has a shot at being the most hilarious. We were staying in the women’s dorm which contained about 20 bunk-beds and at least another 20 mattresses strewn on any available floor surface. The other guests were exclusively Indian, my particular bunk-mate made her irritation at our presence very clearly known-after enquiring of me suspiciously several times ‘why are you here?’, she tried to oust Ali and I to the other side of the room and then insisted Ali move her rucksack as it was in, I quote, ‘the place for my soap’. I also got a very stern yelling for rolling over in the night. The bathrooms are also an adventure as queuing is not a concept which India has adopted. In fact the exact opposite. The shower etiquette goes as follows: barge in when you can and if someone dares to take more than 5 minutes, attempt to knock the door down. Is an interesting approach. The sign stating check-in is from ‘10am to 10am’ (just below the sign that bans ‘all gambling and playing cards’) is clearly not a strict rule as a literal bus-load of women rolled into the room at 6am and, mid full-blast singing, threw a bag onto Cat’s head thinking her bed was empty. One way to start the day!



We found an excellent local restaurant which we quickly made our regular lunch venue-highlight was a HUGE thali for the grand price of 80p including curry, poppadum, family sized portion of rice, various non-descript but fantastic sauces and poori, a kind of puffed up bread which is delicious. The food situation only got better as we decided to splash out for our Saturday dinner and go to a beautiful hotel for an afternoon and evening of fruit platters, masala peanuts, cocktails and (for me) pasta in their courtyard, candle-lit restaurant. I visited the toilets approximately 55 times to make full use of the toilet roll. Speaking of toilets we also found a mall in the middle of Mysore which is half built (health and safety not on the radar) but very much open and contained, much to our delight, air-conditioning, the most impressive selection of ice-cream flavours I have ever seen, escalators and, the crowning glory, a set of loos with not only toilet roll but soap dispensers and an actual hand drier. You have never seen 6 people so excited. So much so that we visited again on the Sunday. In my haste I managed to fall over the doorway and slice my toe at which point the very lovely security man leapt at the opportunity to christen his first aid kit and doused my wound with not one, not two, not three, but FOUR types of antiseptic. It is still the cleanest wound in the history of time.

The palace is one of the most impressive buildings I have ever seen from stunning green-pillared wedding room (dad-get saving I have found my future marriage venue) to very British-style stained glass windowed courtyards. We returned in the evening for the promised light spectacular display of the 42000 bulbs lining the palace. After a few tepid flashes we gave up and went to drink some beer instead. Equally cultural. On the Sunday morning we got a bus to Chamundi Hill to visit the temple which at first read I am sure sounds incredibly serene. Think again. The temple itself is a beautiful white building perched on top of a hill with an incredible view of Mysore. However the rest of India decided they also wanted to witness its beauty on the same day. There was a queue (which actually seemed to function as a queue) looping round the entire building. We naturally had to pay the 3x increased foreigner price which did mean that we got fast tracked through the throngs straight into the temple, past the ‘coconut breaking place’, into the Goddess chamber where you are instructed to stick your hand in fire and drink holy water which looked so dubious we threw it on our heads instead. And then 30 seconds later we were out! And into the market next to the temple which includes the most bizarre selection of toys you could possibly imagine. Am still baffled by the thought process that went into making some of these things:

‘OK boss, I have an idea. For our next big seller how about a plastic man with a cone shaped head pushing a plastic cart full of tiny white balls’

‘Not bad, let’s make 500 in 10 different colours, but I was thinking more along the lines of a plastic baby in basket called “Titoo”’.

‘Brilliant boss. But I have an even better idea. Take the same plastic baby, surround it by neon pink fluff and make it into a rucksack.’

‘We have a winner’.

We spent what we thought would be our final few Mysore hours in a rooftop café overlooking the palace as a parade drummed away below us punctuated with the occasional cannon boom. No-one seemed too alarmed by this though we did see several birds literally drop out of the tree opposite us. Afterwards we headed to the bus station in plenty of time for our 17:30 bus home. I resist the urge to use the ‘physically challenged toilet’. 17:30 came and went. Turned out our bus had crashed on the way and was cancelled. Ah. After a fun half hour of shoving in the refund ‘queue’ we found out there is another bus at 11.30pm that we were about to book when we realised it wouldn’t arrive until 7am. Ah. Why? Turns out that the forest roads close overnight as this is when the elephants presumably get their rage on so the bus simply stops for a few hours. In the middle of the forest. We quickly vetoed this option and found a hotel near the bus station which for the grand price of £10 a night (we decided it was justified as we had spent £1.20 at the hostel of dreams). We were rewarded by a rooftop pool; lady kit containing essentials such as toothpaste, bindis and tongue scrubber; fan AND air conditioning AND TV, all of which I turned on immediately, just because I could-Harry Potter in Hindi is a fascinating experience; mirror which helpfully asks ‘am I smart’; and the best shower head I have seen in a month. It. Is. Heaven. We reluctantly left the next morning and our 7am bus mercifully appeared. After an hour-long tyre change we are finally on our way. Clearly the little boy in front of us was caught short as his mother dangled him out the window to do his business. Unfortunately we had all the windows open and Ali and Alex received a lovely face-full of toddler pee to finish off our very eventful weekend! As Han (wrongly but very accurately) read from the guide book: ‘If you haven’t been to Mysore, you just haven’t been’.

Dodge the cow
I touched down in Bangalore just before midnight on Monday, and was greeted at arrivals by Veena and her friend, Indu. We took the hour's drive back to V's place and after a short catch-up on the balcony, my tiredness got the better of me and I turned in. For some reason, I'd stayed wide awake for the full four and a half hour flight, which is very unlike me. I usually can't sit still for five minutes without drifting off. I somehow managed to zonk out whilst riding in a Cambodian tuk-tuk for goodness' sake! And those of you that have ridden in Cambodian tuk-tuks will understand how difficult a task that should be.

The next day, we just chilled before heading out late afternoon. We went to Frazer Town and had a coffee at French Loaf, where I was eaten alive by mosquitos and - for the first (and hopefully last) time during my travels - was attacked by a spider. Now, most people know about my paralysing fear of creatures of the arachnid variety, and those who don't, usually experience a mix of amusement and utter shock at my reaction to seeing one. Anyway, I was just
sitting there, minding my own business, when something dropped on my arm. I mindlessly flicked it away, and in doing so, noticed that it was a spider. Unfortunately, my flick had not been strong enough for the eight-legged terrorist, and so strong was its conviction in terrifying the life out of me, that it landed on my leg. I closed my eyes, flapped my hands in the air and incoherently whimpered at Veena, begging her to help me. Bless her cotton socks - she jumped out of her chair and in seconds, had removed the assailant from my person. Once I had calmed my breathing, and recovered from my traumatic experience, she began gently teasing me about how small the spider was. I was in no position to argue with the woman that just saved my life, so I graciously accepted the mockery.

Still reeling from the recent dramatic event, we went in search of food, stopping at a small street stall serving panipuri, which is a common snack in the north of India. It's basically a crispy, hollow pastry ball with a large hole in it, which is then filled with potato, onion, chilli and some seasonings, followed
Watch it, people!
by 'pani' (Hindi for water). This is then served on a banana leaf 'saucer'. Anyway, the idea is to just shove the whole thing in your mouth, lest you dribble the liquid down your chin. No prizes for guessing who made a mess of herself.

Next, we popped across to a sweet shop, selling an array traditional Indian sweets, such as gulab jamoon (small sausage-looking deep-fried dough rolls soaked in sugar water) and raspuri (small, yellow balls, of Bengali origin). I got a little too excited, and proceeded to order half the shop, not even deterred by the power-cut half-way through.

My first observation of Indian roads was that drivers use their horns more than any other function on their cars/autos/mopeds. During peak hours, it's hard to hear yourself think over the constant honking and bibbing, and the sheer number of vehicles on the roads sends my mind into utter confusion. I didn't know which way to look, let alone where to cross. It has to be said, however, that drivers are quite skilled when it comes to dodging crossing pedestrians and Sunday-strolling cattle.

And that brings me to observation number two: cows. Throughout the day, I
Random monkeys
They looked at me rather aggressively, so I ran like the wind after taking this photo!
saw numerous cows just wandering the streets, some down the middle of the roads (causing vehicles to divert around them), some taking the civilised pavement route, and some just chilling by the road-side. The bizarre thing is, they are just as oblivious to the honking horns and bustling traffic as the drivers are to the sight of cattle strolling in their paths. One cow was even chewing away on a crash helmet that had been left on a moped outside a shop! You see, cows are seen as sacred in Hindu society, and one of the reasons for this is that the god of revenge, Shiva, rode one through Heaven. Likewise, monkeys are not killed due to their association with the god Hanuman.

In the evening, Veena's housemate Vidya and their friend Ashish picked us up and we briefly swung by a poetry reading at Urban Solace, before satisfying our hungers at Queen's - a Punjabi restaurant on Church Street. We ordered a variety of dishes, including palak paneer (spinach and cottage cheese), mushroom masala (self-explanatory) and malai kofta (veggie balls). Wow! The meal was amazing, so much so that the lack of meat didn't even register in my mind. With food like that, I could easily be vegetarian.

At some point during our walk to Frazer Town, Veena asked me how I feel about the attention I get in public. No, not the sort of looks that Julia Roberts got when she donned the red dress and strutted through the hotel lobby in Pretty Woman; the ""oh look, a foreigner!"" look. Until she mentioned it, I hadn't even realised I was drawing attention, to be honest. I grew so accustomed to being stared at in Korea, I'm oblivious to it now. Perhaps this can be considered in a positive light, in that I feel no form of self-consciousness, but in terms of 'keeping my wits about me'? Not so much.

Wednesday and today were basically chill days, interspersed by periods of eating and my own private showing of the movie Veena directed, 'Reminiscence of Ether'. I was blown away. Such a lovely story line. I listened in awe as Veena told me 'behind the scenes' anecdotes and the production build-up. I'm also proud to say that I have met everyone involved in the making of this movie. Keep your eyes peeled for these guys, people.

And for the food update: Wednesday's lunch consisted of puri, sagu, dhosa and coconut chutney, and dinner was biryani, egg chilli, masala papad and a couple of brandy and cokes at a restaurant called Rewind.

Today, I finally pulled my finger out of my arse and ventured out alone - following very precise instructions from Veena. The aim was to pick up an SD card reader for my iPad from the Apple shop on MG (Mahatma Ghandi) Road since the non-Apple one I bought in Singapore only served to slow down the device's performance. Well, the Apple store doesn't stock them, so I proceeded to Hard Rock Cafe on St Mark's Road, had a couple of iced lattes, then hopped back in an auto to Veena's place in Benson Town.

Veena and I have just been discussing Hindu gods and the stories behind them. I didn't provide such entertaining responsive banter as Pete did back in Cadiz, but i found it just as interesting. Did you know that the Hindu god Ganesh had an elephant head because his father, Shiva, chopped off his original one, not knowing that the man he was decapitating was his own son? Upon discovery of this fact, Shiva duly replaced said head with that of an elephant.

And on that note, I'll bid you goodnight.

How to reach there


The shiva statue is located in the old airport road of Bangalore. If you are going from MG Road side, you have go on the old airport road for about 4kms till you find a shopping complex called “Total Mall” (earlier called Kids Kemp). The Statue is located behind this building, slightly visible to outside. There is an entry at the side of the building, mentioned as “Pahadi Siva dhama Yatra”. You have to mark it from close or you may miss it.


About the temple


The interesting fact of the temple is that it is open in 365 days a year and 24 hours a day. This is something rare for any other temple in India.

Although people feel that the place has been commercialized by selling various types of tickets, you can also go free and have darshan without spending a single rupee. All the tickets are for extraneous activities and not necessary for any common devotee.
Special entry Tickets


There are various types of entries, free entry and special entry. Free entry may have a long queue (as below) and may take about an hour depending on the crowd. Special entry costs 50 rupees to bypass the queue. However, I mostly prefer free entry as it gives me more time to think about God and spend that money on buying other pooja tickets like milk abhishek etc.


The shops at both sides


While standing on a long queue you will come across about hundred shops on both of your side. Shops selling idols of God and other pooja/ religious items. The place may be slightly costlier than other places where they are available cheaper, but you will get a good variety of items here in this place.


Special Pooja tickets


After the queue you will find the ticket counter. This ticket counter is not for fast entry as you have already free entered through the queue. This counter sells ticket for various attractions like:

- Om namah Shivaya Yatra Rs 20/-

- Pahadi Shiva Dhama Yatra Rs 30/-

- Milk abhisek Rs 10/-

- 12 Jyotirling Yatra Rs 10/-

- Paap naash diya Rs 20/-

- Om namah shivaya wish coin Rs 20/-

- Havan Rs 20/-

- Navagraha Rs 10/-

- Vighna haran thread Rs 10/-

- Archana Rs 10/--

Thus total Rs160/- if you buy individual tickets. Alternatively you can buy a special ticket for Rs 100 which includes all the above in a package.
Photography inside the temple


Besides you have to buy camera tickets for Rs 25 and video camera tickets for Rs 100. Earlier till 2008 (?) photography was strictly not allowed. Some people were taking pictures very secretly through mobile cameras. Although I had great wishes to take pictures I never liked taking stealth pictures. But suddenly when I went after a gap that I found that cameras are allowed for a price. I also took a lot of pictures and videos of the beautiful place.
The big statue


After buying special pooja tickets (if you wish so) and camera tickets (again if you need) you are entering to the main compound. Here you can keep your shoes in the shoe stand for Rs 2/- and proceed inside.

Now you can see a giant statue of Ganesh and a giant statue of Shiva, both very beautiful and very attractive. You will soon forget the pain of coming so far to see the place. You will feel eager to go close to the statue and see the statue from different angles.

Most people first visit Ganesh statue then proceed to Shiva statue. You have to climb a few steps (about 30) to reach Ganesh statue and then climb down the same on the other side.


Pahadi Shiva dhama yatra


Pahadi shiva dhama yatra is a special place having Himalayan Shiva statues. As I mentioned earlier, if you have bought special tickets you can enter into this place. Apart from various Shiva Lingas you will find Amarnath, which is made of ice. You can touch the ice Linga and feel it in your hands.


Om namah sivaya yatra


If you have bought tickets for this, you will be given 108 coins. There will be 108 pots. You will chant om namah sivaya and put a coin in each of these pots. This is quite interesting and keeps you busy for atleast 5 minues.


The miracle spot


If you have bought tickets for Om namah Shivaya wish coin, you can wish something at this spot and drop the coin in the water. People believe that their wishes will be fulfilled.


Papa nashini diya


You may buy tickets for getting a candle from this counter and float the candle on the water in front of the statue.


Havan


This is a ticketed activity. You will be given a piece of wood and a small bowl of ghee for havan. You will go to the havan kunda (behind me in the picture below) and put the wood and ghee inside. There will always be fire inside the havan kunda to burn your offerings.


Navagraha


There is a navagraha temple inside the compound as ususal in any other temple in south India. You can have free darshan of Navagraha. But if you have bought a ticket then you will be given a deepa (candle) to pray the lords.


Coming out


Coming out of the temple is fairly simple. As the whole place is an open compound there is nothing much to confuse. You take the exit any time after having darshan. The entry and exit are two different routes. You will find a lot of shops on the exit route too. If you have failed to buy anything while entering, you can buy from here.


At the end


The place is very peaceful. You can sit here for long time. Especially in the evening it is very peaceful to sit here in the courtyard in front of the statue and stare at the statue. People staying close to this area come here regularly for a prayer to the Lord. As I stay far (about 15 kms) which takes one to two hours drive depending on traffic, I come about once in a year.

Shivaratri is a festival day and you have to stand on long queues. Avoid on Shivaratri if you are not a serious devotee. Once in Shivaratri (2006) I stood on the queue in the evening and had darshan of the lord at 2 O’clock after standing for about 8 hours. Reaching home was almost morning.

I have seen some other big Shiva statues, one in Haridwar, one in Gajnur (Karnataka), one in Murudeshwar (Karnataka). I guess Murudeshwar statue is the largest of all. Bangalore statue is probably more homely 😊 (because I stay in Bangalore!).

Steam - the good old days - to Ooty
So next stop after The Andamans are parts of South India, before heading north for a few weeks, and then going to Japan at the end of this month. These are, in fact, “filler” weeks as we were going to do Darjeeling & Sikkim till we discovered that it might be too cold to visit this time of year, and we didn’t wish to carry our warm gear with us as well through the places we have visited since the girls left.

We get a Jet Airways flight from Port Blair to Chennai after a slight hic cup when we realise we don’t have the copy of the e-ticket for C. Thankfully there is a Jet counter at the entrance to the airport & we get a copy free (as she is sooooo nice) - they decide not to charge her the Rs 100 usual fee for dorks who forget such things.

The flight is uneventful other than the surprise lunch on board and the nerdy kid in front of us who couldn’t just talk to his parents but had to shout at an annoying pitch every five seconds - M could quite easily have strangled him. Ipods to
Arjuna's Penance - Mam
the rescue and the squirt lived to see another day.

Chennai

We arrive at the new Chennai airport ½ hour (2.35pm) early which is great and then luckily we bump into a Czech guy (Michael from Prague) who’s also looking to take a pre-paid cab to Mamallapuram. So we share the cost (Rs 1280) and the cab gets us there in an hour and a half. We therefore, avoid the hassle of getting a Metro to the centre, finding the Bus station and then taking a 2 hour bus ride to get there. We also avoid the need to stay in Chennai which isn’t our bag. We were here 5 years ago and it didn’t do it for us then. However, from the air Chennai looks great with the houses all brightly coloured in yellows, pinks, purples, blues etc amid palm tree lined streets.

We’ll be back to catch the train to Ooty in a few days.

Mamallapuram – The World Heritage Site for the Pallava Dynasty carvings & Temple.

The ride to Mamallapuram is slow going for a while then the freeway opens up and we travel along the sea shore for miles. There
C & friend - too early for an ice cream - Mysore
are a host of tourist places here now and large backwater lakes, a few filled with Indian Pink Flamingos – smaller and less pink than the ones in Africa.

We get to the town in bright daylight. We had rung ahead and booked a room at a Hotel (we thought was a family Guest House) called Le Vie en Rose. Odd name for a place here – but then so are most of the places in what the LP guide rightly refers to as “Backpackistan”! The hotel is fine – only Rs 600 per night – wow. It’s also near the Bus stop and at the center of the action here.

One thing we discover early on is that M’s Hindi isn't going to be much help – most locals only speak Tamil and some English. So English it is - as his Tamil is pretty non-existent despite the fact he spent 3 years in University at Chennai.One point of note in this part of the world/India is that names of people seem to go on forever - see the signs we have taken pictures of.

The place really is a backpacker’s delight and pretty chilled. The
Beach & Shore Temple - Mam
main drag off the town’s High Street (called East Raja Street) is Othadavai Street where most of the eateries and shops are. It leads to the sea where life seems largely the same as it was for the local fishing community many years ago bar the arrivals of the tourists and everything that brings. The fishermen are busy getting on with life, fixing nets, preparing nets for fishing at sunset, fixing boats, playing cards till fishing time etc. All the while many cows, some dogs and quite a few foreigners walk around them.

The sea front cafes and restaurants are all painted in bright colours as are the fishing boats all along the shore front. The sea looks clean but is more for surfers than swimmers. At the shore, resplendent at sea level is one of the famous temples – called quite originally – Shore Temple!! There’s a movie or TV crew working nearby.

Looking around we can only imagine that this is akin to Hampi, which many travellers have said is really lovely and laid back with the usual blend of Indian mysticism, history and picturesque landscape. We do regret the fact that we missed the chance
The Five Rathas - Mam
to go there when we were in Goa (we didn't realise we were so close to it; about 180 kms). However, we can always add this into our next trip to India, together with Dharamsala & Manali which we discounted in favour of Leh, Srinagar & Sikkim when we get back in June.

We find a really small book shop and discover that they are selling the new LP India Guide – second hand for Rs 500 – bargain and we are back in business.

After all the seafood in the Andamans we are ready for some good south Indian food – Dosa’s, Idli, Uttappam etc. But amazingly most places are labelled North Indian or tourist joints – we have to search out the two places that do what we want - Anand Bhavan & Mamalla Bhavan. Mamalla is the better of the two and we eat there quite often – awesome breakfasts and dinners and very cheap. It’s a bit of a local institution with staff that seem to have been there since the day it opened – the guy who serves us is really sweet and attentive. We also take Michael (the Czech version!) there one
Big sculptures - Mam
breakfast - as he’s a keen foodie with an ambition to open his own eatery back in Prague - so he can experience Pongal (a sort of rice, lentil and spice mix that’s yummier than it sounds!) and all the other delights and their excellent Madras coffee.

We do try seafood one night at Ponn Water Face – Kalamari & seafood noodles – ok, but not as good as the Andamans. We only went there really for the “cheap” beer (at Rs 180 it isn’t cheap at all but there’s no bottle shop nearby so needs must!).

Internet here is great value at Rs 30 per hour and really fast so we catch up with family & friends and spend a happy two hours uploading our last three blogs.

We have come here to see the temples and rock carvings from the 7th Century, during the Pallava Dynasty, which now have UNESCO World Heritage status. The 2 separate sites have to be paid for – The Five Rathas and the Shore Temple. In all honesty, unless you want to get close to the carvings to see them in detail, it’s not worth paying. You can see the
Steam Train to Ooty
Five Rathas quite easily from the road and the Shore Temple from the beach. M is definitely not convinced that the sites warrant World Heritage status and in terms of value for money for the RS 250 fee – it only warrants about Rs 50 compared to other World Heritage sites we have seen in India.

At one of the Temples in town (Talasayana Perumal) there is a story that the Shore Temple was built on the spot where Vishnu appeared to a saint who was trying to bail out the sea (!) to present a gift to Vishnu. The Five Rathas (5 temples and a life sized elephant and lion) are apparently carved out of one huge piece of stone and may or may not be dedicated to the five Pandavas and their wife – the heroes of Mahabharata – depending on whether you believe LP or the Archaeological Survey of India respectively!

The rest of the sites are free, and to our eyes, more impressive. Especially the bas relief carvings of Arjuna’s Penance and Trimurthi’s Cave. These are all found in one long stretch of grounds along the edge of town which makes a popular local
Mysore Palace
picnic site (judging by the litter left around!). A local favourite is called Ganesh’s Butter Ball (haven’t a clue why?), a large boulder that sits on a slope precariously which is good for photo’s. We do most of the sites early in the morning and late afternoon when it’s more comfortable as it’s incredibly hot and humid here; we think only Palenque in Mexico was more sweat inducing.

The stone carving craft is still a major feature of the town, with sculpture workshops everywhere and either the gentle noise of stone chiselling or the whirring din of stone cutting machines. There are some pretty impressive pieces which we suspect are bound for businesses as they’d be too large for a home.

Weekends see a lot of local day-trippers on buses, coaches and in their own cars and all the sites are packed with folk (generally all dressed up and the women with garlands in their hair) and the restaurants are full.

We meet up with Michael again one evening for a beer (he’s not sure whether to go to Hampi & other parts of India or go back to The Andamans which he loves). We hope to
Chamundi Hill Mysore
meet up with him when we head to Prague in future. The next day we take the local Express bus to Chennai, where we are to catch our overnight train to Metupalaiyam and (hopefully) the early morning connection with the Mountain Railway steam train up to Ooty. We book our bags into storage at Chennai station for convenience (Rs 45 for 3 bags for one day) but we aren’t inspired to go out and about. M lived here for 3 years as a student and we visited in our last trip and really it’s just a big smelly city. So instead we find a chair in the waiting room upstairs (which is quite big and airy) near a power point and play games and catch up on planning and the blog.

Supper is some awesome kebab rolls from Tibby Frankies in the station – chicken tikka and paneer with mint sauce are best. Then all aboard for overnight the trip to Ooty.

Travellers Tips:

There are only 3 direct buses from Mamallapuram to Central Chennai a day. Rs 39. Then get a local bus from the bus station to Central Railway station Rs 7.

Udagamandalam…….. (Simply
All aboard - Mountain Railway
known as Ooty)

So from the sweltering heat of Mamallapuram, we are sitting in our room in Ooty writing this wrapped in blankets!! It’s cool here.

The overnight journey went well and in fact we arrive into Metupalaiyam 30 mins early; great as it means time for a couple of good hot coffees and lots of photos of the Nilgiri Mountain Railway narrow gauge steam train and steam engines before we set off. Aditya has managed to get us 1st class tickets, one on each side of the carriage so we get the best photo opps of the views all the way up. (Thanks Aditya). The journey takes 5 hours with plenty of stops along the way for refreshments etc. We see quite fresh elephant poo by the tracks but no signs of the real thing. There are also plenty of birds and butterflies and the vegetation changes from palm trees to tea plantations to eucalyptus trees as we go higher.

On some of the steeper sections, the steam train engine really struggles and shudders and on arrival at Coonor after 3 hours, the steam engine is replaced with a diesel engine for the final 2 hour
Brindhavan Gardens - night show
leg to Ooty. More smooth but less atmospheric. (Unfortunately we also change travelling companions at Coonor; some eejit Brits and their guide join us and we soooo want to tell them where to get off for being completely obnoxious & ignorant twits!! The Indian guide wasn’t much better, giving incorrect information. M has to bite his lips, a lot; we guess they deserve each other.)

Anyhow, the train journey is a great experience and at only R’s 350 for both of us, an absolute bargain.

We have planned to stay for one night in Ooty, with the option for more if we like it. As we pull in we decide we are not too sure. However, the weather changes and it starts to rain and gets really cooler. This gets us to decide that 1 night will definitely be enough (a view that is confirmed later when we wander into town for some lunch) as it seems a very non-descript place despite the colourful houses. An impression not helped by the heavily over cast sky.

We are staying at Hotel Sweekar, overlooking the town and racecourse which is right slap bang in the middle of the town.
Mamalla Bhavan - great food & service
It’s an English style bungalow and ok for the money (R’s 550) but a bit basic. Thankfully the owner is a nice chap who happily gives us extra blankets as we are feeling the cold.

We head back into town for a mooch and some lunch but despite the recommendations in LP it’s really hard to find anywhere that looks interesting and we have to walk for ages. It’s also raining – cold rain! Waterproof jackets required. In the end we head for a bar for a couple of beers then a local halal restaurant for some chicken kebabs. Not bad.

On the way back we call into the bus station and pre book our coach seats for the trip to Mysore in the morning. We are able to choose our seats which is great – first time this trip we are doing a long (5 hours) bus journey in India. More surprising is that M gets a discount for being of mature age!!

We dine at Kebab Corner after a few cheap beers at a local bar. The food and service are really good and reasonably priced.

We are up early and have a lovely
Colourful Mamallapuram
light breakfast at the Guest House and get to the bus stop to get to Mysore. Today the sun is shining and Ooty looks very different and more interesting. We reflect on this and realise perhaps we were perhaps being influenced by the weather and judging Ooty by our experiences elsewhere rather than accepting what it has to offer us as visitors. Ooty has a lot of amenities and areas of interest close by. Nature trails and trekking are big draws aswell as the local national parks.

It’s spread over a vast area. The pockets of housing are colourful and have a charm all of their own. The Nilgiri Tea plantations give a lovely colour and texture to the landscape; the land is fertile and green with fruit and vegetables growing. Other than Tea, the big draw here is chocolate – including chocolate tea (yuck says M). The chocolates (including a Jain version) are home made with a variety of fillings – nuts, raisins, dates etc – and sold in just about all general shops along the streets.

Being in South India, all the signs are in Telegu, as are the posters for films recently released and as
Comfort break & stop for refuelling - Ooty
it’s election time – wall to wall posters of politicians trying to grab your vote!

As we drive from away from Ooty we feel perhaps another day or so may have given us a totally different perspective of the place & its people. The drive is a challenge by anyone’s standards and more so when your driver is in a hurry. The bus has to negotiate 36 hairpin bends and most of the passengers (not us thankfully) end up throwing up into sick bags provided by the bus company. They even run out of them by the time we hit the plains. It does make us wonder why these folks who have paid quite a lot for this bus trip couldn’t take a motion sickness tablet (cost about Rs 5) that would stop their discomfort.

The drive takes us right through the heart of the Mudumalai National Reserve where we spot 4 wild elephants and many deer. Next we are into the Bandipur Tiger Reserve – but no tigers I’m afraid despite a thorough search around.

Eventually we hit Karnataka – the next state and eventually (after a 20 mins pit stop for a comfort break and
Devaraja Market - Mysore
some lunch) we arrive ahead of schedule in Mysore.

Mysore – The Garden City (we are not so sure!)

We arrive at the Mysore Central Bus station ½ hour ahead of schedule. It’s an impressive bus station, modern and bustling. It’s also clean and has good information counters, a few eateries (veg & non-veg), plenty of snack stands and all the facilities you would expect.

We are persuaded by a “tout” to try the Aishwaraya Residency nearby rather than go to our chosen hotel as it offers free wi-fi and various other amenities unlike the one we were going to for the same price. So we check it out and it’s ok – as much as we dislike dealing with touts, the free wi-fi clinches it for us as we need this for sorting out many things for our trips to Japan & The Philippines and to skype Sarah on her Big Birthday!!

It’s pretty hot in Mysore and our first impressions of the city is that it is well planned with wide streets, pretty clean, with buildings reflecting its history under Mughal rule, The Royal heritage, the British and now Indian independence. Most places in
Chamundi Hill Temple - Mysore
the central area are walkable. In theory it’s a place we should enjoy. But….What is interesting for us is the absence of good eating places in & around the centre. There are hundreds of Hotels that have small eating places (veg or non-veg) but very few decent restaurants. And so it doesn’t quite do it for us as a place of interest.

We read about a day trip of Mysore and Sirangapatna (the abode of the once King Tippu Sultan) run via the Karanataka Tourism Office which we decide to go for. At Rs 210 each, it starts at 8.30 am and finishes at about 8.30 pm.

We are the only foreigners on the small mini bus for the trip. The rest are folks from various parts of India visiting Mysore. The guide thankfully speaks in English, Hindi and Kannada (the local state language). The tour covers the following sites:

Jaganmohan Palace:

This is the old residence of one of the rulers of Mysore which is now an “Art Gallery” come Museum. Entry is Rs 130 for foreigners and we weren’t sure about going in but didn’t have a lot of option as we had to
The town & racecourse - Ooty
pay the guide up front for all the entry tickets – this included. We were pleasantly surprised though. The building has architectural merit. Inside it has a host of regal memorabilia, many rare musical instruments, some great paintings – notably one called The Glow of Hope which has a room to itself and is impressive as is a pencil drawing of Tagore. There were amazingly carved Tusks and a black stone elephant. The Rosewood hand carved furniture was awesome as was the marble small replica of the Mysore palace. Upstairs, there’s an amazing Ivory Palanquin that once carried the rulers here. The inside of the building looks tired but the size of it all gives a sense of what royalty had in days gone by.

Mysore Palace (Ambavilas Mahal):

The big cheese in Mysore without doubt. Entry is Rs 250 to the main palace and they want another Rs 280 from foreigners to see the residential bit of the palace. This is optional & we opt out. The Palace though is still a working palace for ceremonial events in Mysore. The big festival is Dussehra in Oct when the King and gentry go on an elaborate parade &
Devaraja Market Mysore
jamboree with decorated elephants, horses etc.

We are not allowed to take cameras in so no photographs unfortunately. The place is well maintained as it’s still private. The most striking areas are The Main Durbar, The Marriage room (which has the most amazing glass ceiling made of iron and stained glass manufactured in Glasgow. The scope of colours makes it breath-taking – a truly grand design for its day!) And finally the King’s private audience room – again the ceiling is a beautifully coloured stained glass marvel of craftsmanship. It brings the place alive – even today. The door to and from the room are amazingly carved with ivory insets. One is carved in Silver. All very regal and grand as befitting a king! Well worth the entry fee.

The surrounding garden and area is also well maintained and there are a variety of Temples at corners of the outer perimeter and very grand gateways on each side. The elephants are kept in an enclosure not far away. The palace glows with a hundred thousand light bulbs every Sunday between 7 and 8 pm & for big national events.

St Philomena’s Church (AKA St Joseph’s Cathedral):
Vishnu Bhavan - great breakfast & coffee - Mysore

It’s a catholic cathedral which has a Gothic look to it but neither the outside or inside are particularly spectacular. It’s a 10 min whistle stop trip.

The Mysore City Zoo:

It’s part of the trip & not somewhere we were looking forward to having had our fill of zoos (no disrespect to Pi & Pondicherry!!) However, this for us was the surprise package of the lot. Entry Rs 40 – foreigners and Indians (parity for once - yeah). It’s really clean, well laid out and the directions and signs lead you to all the sites. It looks well-kept and managed; there is significant investment in new areas being prepared for the animals. They have a great selection of birds including white peacocks which we’ve never seen before. Some of the other highlights for us were the really healthy Bengal Tigers, the awesome leopards, the cheetahs, the white rhino and the only Gorilla in India.

Chamundi Hill & Nandi - The Bull:

On top of Chamundi hill is a temple – nothing special to look at as Indian Temples go but is apparently one of the most sacred. A quick flit through (Rs 30 entry +
Entrance to Mysore Palace
Rs 2 for the shoes stand – a new Indian stealth tax or enterprise by all temples and mosques!! In addition to the ridiculously high entry fees for foreigners.)

Half way down the hill, there’s a 10 minute stop to see a huge Bull called Nandi (representing Shiva) carved from one very large stone – quite impressive really.

After a few photos we were ready for lunch.The break for lunch is at a Hotel complex in the city which looks in part like a building site. The options are a South Indian Thali & a North Indian Thali at a set price and not particularly a good advert for Mysore or Indian cuisine – enough said. The prices of the cold drinks were extortionate too.

Srirangapatnam:

Was the seat of Tippu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali. They ruled for 36 years. Tippu Sultan had his fort and palace here and was defeated by the British and killed after a bloody encounter having been betrayed by his uncle. The place Tippu was killed is marked by a stone. The fort is in ruin and was actually blown up by the Bristish within 6 hours of the
Five Rathas - backside view as they say
battle in 1799. The fort was strategically built on the confluence of 2 rivers. While there we stop for a visit to a very uninspiring Ranganatha Swamy Temple. Unfortunately, the guide misjudged his timings so we didn’t make it to Tippu’s summer palace which is supposed to be beautiful.

Brindavan Gardens:

The other big draw, for Indians particularly, are the Brindavan gardens – most of the middle aged and older generation who were fed on Bollywood movies (as there was no TV at the time) will recall many happy Indian songs being filmed here with hero and heroine prancing around each other coyly (with heavy suggestions of sexual attraction – Indian style of course). The gardens are at the bottom of a 3 km dam wall built by the kings of Mysore. The gardens are laid out reasonably well and separated in the middle by a lake. On one side is a nightly colourful fountain display to India music which most of the day trippers come for. It’s not quite worth the journey in our view – but Indians love gardens, sunsets and musical fountains so for them it is heaven!!

We eventually get back at 8.45pm
Ganesh's Butter Ball, Mam
and get dropped off near the bus stop so we can dive into the Bar for a cold beer or 2. Unfortunately, the guy serving us that night clearly didn’t like our presence in the place so ignored us for ages till his boss had to tell him off. A complete shit head compared to the guy who had served us really well the previous 2 nights.

The best eating experiences for us were at Hotel New Shilpashri Bar & Restaurant & The RRR Hotel, both in Gandhi Square. The latter is an institution and gets packed out. Their speciality is a vegetarian thali served on Banana leaves – a dying art in India. They also do a few non – veg dishes. Be prepared to queue a bit, but it’s worth it and the turnaround is really quick.

One place worth a visit is the area known as the Devaraja Market. It’s colourful and has a host of interesting stalls selling most things you are ever likely to need to live and eat. Drinks you have to get from a Bottle shop!!

Bengaluru

It’s difficult to say a lot about the place as it’s
Inside Devaraja market Mysore
been labelled the High Tech city & happening place in India etc. However, we are only here for about 3 hours and our experience in that time is pretty poor on a number of fronts – so we are aware that our comments may not reflect the real B.

The train journey from Mysore to B goes off without a hitch. It takes 3 hours on the Chaumandi Express which only runs from Mysore to B. The station at B is pretty big and clean and they have a left luggage counter which we use so that we might explore the city a bit. However, once out of the station – the main Bus station (Majestic) is reached via an underpass. The rest of the road is blocked off and the area looks like a building site. We try to catch a rickshaw to the City Market area (as we don’t have much time) and for 1km the guy asks for Rs 200. The others aren’t interested as we suspect that the fare is pretty low. As we have had no breakfast and left the Hotel in Mysore at 5.45 am we try a local eatery at the station.
High Street & Bus Stop - Mam
Crap coffee. Toilet flooded. The public “pay as you use” Toilets which seem to be all over the South charge C Rs 3 and M only 2? Given the heat we decide it might be better at the airport rather than hang around as we hear that it’s a brand spanking new place.

So au revoir Bengaluru – we seem sure we had the worst of what the city has to offer. The 40km journey to the airport is on the Vayu Vajra A/C Bus – a special airport shuttle which costs Rs 195 each compared to the Rs 770 quoted by the Prepaid Taxi stand at the railway station. It takes 1 hour and they depart on the ½ hour from the main city bus station known as Majestic. The journey takes us through much of the northern half of B with all its flyovers and many new housing developments. It reminds us of Pune in a way – which we liked a lot, though a lot bigger and more expensive (given the advertised prices for 2 & 3 bed flats here Rs 29 Lakh to 1.5 Crore).

Bengaluru airport is relatively new (parts of it still
High Street Ooty
look like its being completed) and has a lot of amenities and is a delight for travellers.

So, this whistle stop tour of some of the South, a last minute substitute for the hills and mountains of Darjeeling and Sikkim, has been a bit of a mixed experience but worth it if only for the train journey to Ooty, Mysore Palace & the carvings at Mamallapuram.

Paisagem de grande beleza: arrozais, agua em abundancia por entre blocos redondos de granito avermelhado. Bananais, coqueirais, caminhos de terra, muitas ruinas de um enorme imperio hindu dizimado pelos muculmanos e templos bonitos, alguns ainda vivios. Gente a lavar-se, a lavar roupa, beber, brincar no rio pela manha.

Se fecharmos os olhos a certas coisas (muito turistico)

Tour das ruinas em bicicleta com um grupo porreiro, sob calor torrido a horas improprias.

Lavei uma 'elefanta', Laxmi, que trabalha no templo. Grande paquiderme , pele aspera e enrugadinha e pelos como arame, a tromba brincalhona e rosada na ponta bufa feliz enquanto a esfregavamos. Grandes patas, solidos troncos, como ossos! E um lindo olhar molhado me olhava da grande cabeca.

Toquei pela primeira vez nos bagos leitosos (ainda nao polinizados, um agricultor explicou-me como 'funcionava'...) da planta do arroz, que tantas vezes tive no prato.

How to reach there


Trimurty temple is around 30 kms from Bangalore on Kanakapura road. If you are going from Banashankari temple, you have to go around 20 kms on National highway 209. However, you have to be vigilant to notice the temple at your left.
The Trimurthy temple


The temple is a combination of three temples, Ganesh, Hanuman and Srikrishna. There are huge statues of Ganesh, Hanuman and Srikrishna on easy of these temples. You can easily notice the three huge statues while going on Kanakapura road (NH 209). It is better that you go by your own vehicle, otherwise you have to try your luck on any Bangalore-Kanakapura bus.



Apart from the huge attractive statues on the temples, the next beautiful attraction of the temple is the garden. The garden has beautiful grass lawn and excellent collection of various plants.



There are various activities in the temple like annadana (free food). Besides there are festivals on various auspicious days, which are written in the notice boards in side the temple.



Apart from these three temples, there are also other temples like Shiva temple etc. The environment is very cool and peaceful and you will definitely enjoy to sit for some time inside the temples.



Although the temple is recently built it has the peace and piousness of old temples. It is colorful, attractive and surrounded by beautiful lawns and trees. It is worth visiting by everybody going on Bangalore-Kanakapura road.

St. Mary’s Basilica


St. Mary’s Basilica is the oldest church in Bangalore. It is located in the Shivaji nagar, next to Shivaji nagar bus stop. The institution was raised to the status of a Basilicaon the order of Pope John Paul VI in the year 1973. Mary’s Feast is celebrated with grand processions in this church every year.



As the church is centrally located, you can approach the church from Queen’s road side, from MG road, from Commercial Street, from Ulsoor lake side etc. However the place being in the heart of the city is overcrowded all the time.


The Mary’s feast celebration


The Mary’s feast is celebrated in the month of September. The Arch Bishop of Bangalore hoists flag in St. Mary’s Basilica to begin the festival. The festival continues for 9 days and ends on the 10<sup style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">th day with a car festival with grand procession.

Other activities are also organized such as thanks giving to elderly couples completing 50 years of marriage,
Celebrations around the church


Not only inside the church, you can find several idols of Mother Mary near the church with beautiful decorations. Usually the celebration continues for 10 days. The last day is celebrated with the car festival with huge crowd.



The above is a Mary’s statue decorated outside the church. These are temporary statues made specifically for this occasion. Similarly below is another temporary decoration on the roadside near the Basilica.


Celebrations inside Basilica


Thousands of people visit the church on this day. People have to stand on a long queue (picture below). Although the crowd is there for the whole day, the length of the queue increases as the time become closer to car festival.



Inside the church, the idol of mother Mary is finely decorated. Many priests take care of various aspects of the festival on the day. The idol of Jesus is also decorated and worshiped in a grand way.


The car festival


The last day of the 10-day long Mary’s feast is celebrated with a car festival. People start gathering in the mid day. The security forces create cordons around the church and don’t allow the crowd to go inside. Ave Maria music and prayers are chanted through loud speakers. Priests from various places come and gather here.



A chariot is decorated with beautiful flowers, lights etc. The idol of mother Mary is placed on it. Some highly ranked priests/ bishops sit on the chariot. Band parties play their music and drums. The place becomes fully crowded.



The Chariot is beautifully decorated. Especially the lights are arranged in a beautiful way. As they give different colors of light, each picture of the chariot will look different. Thousands of people go along with the Chariot. Although people here are generally disciplined, the law and order is maintained by a large number of police.



The festival is celebrated not only by the Christians but people of other religions too. As the Shivaji nagar area is more populated by the Muslims, having shops and businesses, they also get involved in the festival in various ways. The car festival is attended by thousands of people from across different religions.


Some important tips


Parking vehicles in the car festival will be a great problem, as such there is hardly any parking place in Shivaji Nagar. Besides on the day of Mary’s feast the traffic police will not allow any vehicle to enter from a km. If you are taking your vehicle then be ready to park it somewhere at 2 kms distance. Alternatively go by public transport till MG road or Queens road or some place nearby and then take a walk to the church.



St. Mary’s basilica is a 300 years old Church and organizing daily prayers. People of different religions visit it. You can visit it on any day, even if not in Mary’s feast.

Photography is allowed inside the church, you can take beautiful pictures of mother Mary and other views around.

There is possibility of having mild rainfall during September. Twice I got completely wet while watching car festival. Be prepared for that too.

How to reach there



You have to go on Bangalore - Hyderabad National Highway 7. On this road do not take a deviation to the airport. But still proceed until you reach a circle for Devanahalli township marked towards right. You have to go half km further and take a right turn from the highway.



Actually the fort is about 100 mtrs from the highway and visible from the road. But because the fort looks old and not attractive, you are very likely not to notice it from the road. I had never noticed the fort although I had gone more than 50 times on that highway. But this time after coming from the fort I realized that it is in fact visible from the highway.
About the Fort



There is a fort in Devanahalli was built by Mallabairegowda in 1501 A.D. Which was latter taken over by Tippu Sultan in 17th Century A.D. The present fort in Devanahalli is rebuilt by Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan during 17th Century. The fort was then taken over by the British after Tippu lost the battle in Mysore war.



This fort is very different from what I was expecting it to be. I was expecting a ticket counter, a parking place, some guards and stuff. But actually the fort is just an entrance and nothing after that (for the tourists). Talking from a different angle the fort area is used as a regular habitation.

There is no ticket or entrance fee for the fort. The entrance of the fort is rather a regular road to pass through. You can drive in through the fort entrance and go to the habitation area. The entrance to the fort is bit narrow, just enough for a big car to go.



The fort is spread over an area of 20 acres. This is a living fort where many families are living inside. There are many temples inside the fort area, such as Venugopalswamy temple, Siddheswar swamy temple, Raghabendraswamy Math, Chandramouleswar Temple etc.

After we drove in through the fort entrance we first saw two temples, Venugopalswamy temple and Siddheswar Swamy temple. The Venugopalswamy temple is just behind the entrance of the fort, sharing the same common wall.



This is front side (above) of Venugopalaswamy temple. This temple is believed to be the oldest among other temples. The sculptures of this temple are very attractive. We saw a beautiful Vimana (below) which is used to carry the idol during festivals.



There are two black colored statues guarding both the sides of the main entrance of the Venugopalswamy temple (below).



While coming out of Venugopalswamy temple, we could see Siddheswar swamy temple and two other temples in the front within yards.



Siddheswar temple (below) is just in front of Venugopalswamy temple, on the other side of the road, say at 10 meters distance. There is a newly built Siva statue with mirrors which gives multiple reflection of the lord. In order to protect the mirrors from birds and animals the temple is fully covered by metal grill.



The temple has a traditional look with beautiful sculpture. Painting with beautiful colors has made it even more attractive.



The main deity of the temple is lord Siddheswar (behind me above). The deity is old and worshiped since several centuries. A new temple is built in the campus (behind me below) fitted with mirrors at all sides to give infinite reflections of lord Shiva and Parvati.



There are few more temples inside the fort area which we could not visit because of limited time. It was going to be envening and we thought to visit Tipu’s birth place before it gets dark. So we came out of the fort and went further on the same road for 200 meters. We saw a small memorial marked as Tipu’s sultan’s birth place.



However, it has just some archeological importance, but there is nothing much to see. It is just an arch of about 20 feet surrounded by a wall.


Something important at the end



There is nothing much to see in the fort. So don’t go with much expectation, which might lead to frustration. Similar in case of Tipu’s birth place. If you like old monuments and archeological places, then you would like this place.

However, if you are in Bangalore, it is worth driving a few kilometers to visit this place. Particularly if you like temples, you will get some beautiful temples within a kilometer radius.

There is no timing of the fort (as it is always open), no tickets (as the fort entry road is used as the public road). So you can go at any time of your convenience.

There are two Beautiful Nakoda Jain temples on both sides of the highway. They are beautiful and worth visiting.

Nandi hills is also on the same direction. You have to go 2 kms further on the National Highway and then take a left turn for Nandi hills. It will be a good idea to combine Devanahalli fort in your Nandi hills trip and first visit the fort while going to Nandi hills.

April 17th 2015

Udaipur life
I woke up the next morning still feeling off colour and decided to not tour Jodhpur with Brandon and Tayla. I decided some time in bed might do me good. I had breakfast on the roof, admiring the view of theBlueCity in the distance before retreating to the comfort of my bed for the day. I was still feeling quite homesick, but started freaking out about my change of heart the night before when I booked flights to go home early, and after deciding I could do this solo travel thing, I changed my flights back to a later date (another $150 down the drain)! I was feeling quite anxious and full of indecision but put it down to being off-colour.



When Tayla and Brandon got back to the guesthouse late that afternoon they told me that they didn’t think I had missed much and they said that it was probably their least favourite city so far. They spoke of aggressive beggars and said the city as a whole was generally underwhelming. They said it was the first time they have felt unsafe due to the nature of the beggars.



Betel Nut Saliva
Udaipur




I decided it was time to attempt some food. Tayla wasn’t hungry so Brandon and I set off in search of a restaurant that had been recommended. We would have been less than 5 minutes into our walk, walking along a busy crowded footpath, when I saw a guy out of the corner of my eye coming out of a shop and before I knew what was happening I was absolutely COVERED in red sticky saliva…. Yes seriously!



In India the men chew on Betel Nut resulting in large wads of sticky red saliva all over the footpath/roads and big red teethy smiles! This lovely young gentleman had walked out of his shop and spat a big wad of red sticky saliva all over me, missing the footpath. I was horrified and screamed out in disgust. My whole right side including my arm, hand and phone were soaked in a bright red liquid, and in that moment I am not sure who was more horrified, me or the shop keeper who had just landed his betel nut saliva all over the female tourist!



He quickly ran next door to a restaurant
The Whistling Teal.. Loved this place
and came back with a big jug of water and napkins and promptly started trying to clean me up. The last thing I wanted was this person trying to clean me up… After trying to wash it off unsuccessfully, we headed back to the guesthouse so I could get changed. My pants were covered in it and were soaked now from the water! LOL only me!



After relaying the story to Tayla and getting changed we headed back out for a second attempt at getting dinner. It really was a sign of things to come and in hindsight I wish we had just stayed at the hotel. We eventually found the restaurant and had a really beautiful meal. The food was gorgeous.



We then decided to head straight back to the hotel –Jodhpur really didn’t feel like a great vibe for any of us. Brandon and I started walking back towards the guesthouse. Due to the betel nut incident on the footpath, we decided to walk along the road since everyone else was using the roadway to walk too.



Needle Stick Horror




About halfway to the
My puncture wound
hotel a guy walking towards us came straight at us, and walked in between Brandon and I so that we had to separate. As he went past me, I felt a pain on my leg closest to him. My instant reaction was that I had been jabbed with a needle – that is exactly how it felt. I quickly turned to look at the man, but he just continued walking away from us, not looking back. I looked at his hand and the one that had been closest to me was at his side in a clenched fist. I rubbed my leg instantly and instantly felt quite worried. At the time, I guess I went into denial at what had possibly just happened and I didn’t mention it to Brandon. We continued to walk towards the guesthouse as I tried to process what I thought had just happened.



We stopped into a small shop as I had wanted to find a scarf and as I had a quick look I kept looking around to see if anyone was following us – I didn’t feel any different but was worried that maybe I had been drugged. I still
Ready to get blood taken in udaipur
don’t know why I didn’t mention it to Brandon at the time, but I guess I was just thinking I had imagined it.



When we got back to the hotel, I walked into our room and straight away said to Tayla “I think I was just stabbed with a needle”. I then relayed the story to Tayla as I pulled my pants down. I went into a complete meltdown upon seeing a small puncture wound on my upper leg. I could not believe what I was seeing. It was just too scary to contemplate. We then went and told Brandon, who was understandably confused given I had not mentioned it to him when it had happened! We spoke to Jaggi who owned the hotel who arranged a tuktuk to take us to a nearby hospital.



Upon arriving at the hospital, my nightmare just got worse. I was seen quite quickly by an Indian Doctor who basically told me that it was impossible that someone would do that to me and gave me some panadol and betadine! He refused to even look at the puncture wound! I was so upset… and 10 minutes later we
Relaxed at The Whistling Teal
were in a tuktuk heading back to the guesthouse!



When I got back to the guesthouse I had an even bigger meltdown. Tayla went off to bed and I spent the next few hours freaking out crying! I ended up getting onto my friend in Australia and asking her to contact the insurance company for some advice… Not long after this my insurance company phoned me and I have to say the girl that phoned me was absolutely amazing.



She checked in with me for hours afterwards giving me advice and making sure I was okay. We made a plan for me to get a train and taxi through to Udaipur the following morning to find a better hospital. A few hours later, after crying myself to sleep, we all headed off on the train towards Udaipur. Brandon and Tayla decided to keep going on to Mt Abu for a night or two and so at the train station we split with them taking a taxi there and I jumped into another taxi to head to Udaipur.



I eventually made it to my little Oasis called “Little Garden Guesthouse” inUdaipurwhere I
My little oasis in Udaipur
met up with my new friend Akshay and his family who ran the guesthouse. I sat with the family and drank the best Chai I had ever had and made a plan to get to the new hospital. Akshay was amazing and he arranged a tuk tuk to take me to the hospital. The insurance company had lined it all up for me at the hospital and I was told to turn up and ask for a specific Doctor. When I got to the hospital, they had no idea who I was or who the Doctor was I was meant to see and I ended up standing in the middle of the waiting room bawling my eyes out. I was a complete mess! Next thing I knew I was surrounded by nurses who tried to help me but in the end I was told to come back that night. I got out of the hospital and walked for some distance before finding a tuk tuk to take me back to the guesthouse. Once back there I found a lovely little café called the Whistling Teal and had some lunch. This would become my little Oasis over the next week.
The red dot in the centre of this photo is my needle mark



After lunch I retreated to the guesthouse and at 6pm I went back to the hotel. The Doctor was just as useless as the previous one and again, didn’t check out my injury and told me I was over reacting because ‘noone would do that’. The insurance company had told me that I was being sent to this hospital as they had HIV medication and it was their recommendation I take a course just in case. The Doctor stated they didn’t stock it and I didn’t need it because they could not tell if the needle had HIV or not! (Kind of the reason TO take it, NOT not take it I would say!)



In tears again I phoned Akshay from the Guesthouse and he insisted on coming to pick me up. While I was waiting for him I got back on to the Insurance company and told them the outcome. When Akshay turned up he took me for a crazy drive aroundUdaipur. He was trying to cheer me up but I was poo’ing my pants! Crazy driver! He ended up taking me to another hospital that the Insurance company told me to get to.
My only photo of Jodhpur.. from the rooftop of the Guesthouse
When we got there I met a lovely female, Doctor Sanjeep who FINALLY took me seriously! She gave me a tetanus shot, took some blood for my baseline results and made an appointment for the following day.



Akshay then drove me back to the guesthouse stopping along the way for some Gulab Jamun (an Indian dessert). Once back at the guesthouse, Akshay took me up onto the roof of the guesthouse to show me the beautiful palace nearby! Thank God for Akshay and his beautiful little family!

March 2nd 2013
Published: March 2nd 2013


How to reach there


Chunchi falls is about 90 kms from Bangalore city. From Bangalore you have to go to Kanakapura. From Kanakapura you have to go on Sangama/ Mekedatu road. Before about 10 kms from Sangama you will find a signboard for chunchi falls to go towards left. After going for about 6 kms on rural road you will find chunchi falls.
The Waterfall


Chunchi fall is located on river Arkavati. The waterfall is nestled among the amazing ranges of rocks. You can park your vehicle in the open field there and walk inside the rocky area. The area is definitely risky and you will find some warning sign boards at the entrance.



Initially you will find a straight cut way to walk down for about 300 meters. Then you will find a canal bridge. As you will be eager to see water, you will immediately be excited to see that canal water and bridge in the jungle. But have patience to walk further there is much more to see ahead.



Then gradually there will be no demarcated route to walk. You will land up in a rocky zone, where you can either go nowhere (if you are scared) or you can go anywhere (if you can jump on the rocks). Now you are in the difficult part of trekking.



As there is no visible road, you will have some disadvantages. You may move this side to that side and get exhausted much before you reach the fall. If it is summer and mid day, then the place will be extremely hot (because of stones). You should better carry some drinking water with you. The other problem is if you are on a dry day or odd time and there is nobody, then you may feel scared and return back from half way.

There are two solutions; one is to go on a holiday where you can expect some more visitors on the spot. This will help you to trace the route on the rocks. Alternatively take a local from there who will guide you short cut route for a small price (say Rs 20 to 30).



We were lucky to have a local guide who took us straight into the water fall through all kinds of funny zig-zag path. We saw two waterfalls, one smaller while going inside and another bigger at the end. However, the water was less because of summer season. In rainy season, the water is ferocious as people say.



I got down to the water and took bath in the fall. It was extremely risky and thrilling at the same time. Cold water in hot summer was quite enjoyable. But I was afraid of the slippery stones and the depth on the other side.



Overall the experience was exciting in Chunchi falls. The water you see in picture was in extreme summer. There will be much more water in rainy season. The place surrounded by green forests look scary and adventurous. It was a great adventure trip for me and will be for anybody. (Note: This article was first posted in JournalSite )

How to reach there

Veerabhadreshwara temple is on a small hill located on the road side 12 kms from Ramanagaram on Kanakapura road. If you are going from Ramanagaram, you will first see Sabbakere from where a road goes to right side towards Siddheshwara beta. You can leave that road and go straight on Kanakapura road. You will find this temple within one km at the left side of the road. The vehicles can go to the foot of the hill and small vehicles can go up to the hill.


<iframe src=""http://wikimapia.org/#lat=12.6422292&lon=77.3437232&z=14&l=0&ifr=1&m=w&tag=287&v=1"" frameborder=""0"" width=""460"" height=""322""></iframe>
The temple

While coming from Ramagaram to Kanakapura you will find a beautiful arch on the left side of the road (right side while coming from Kanakpura to Ramanagaram). You can go through the arch and reach the hill temple within half km.



There are two ways to the hill, one driveway for the vehicles and another steps for the walkers. However, the driveway is not very wide for cars but wide enough for bikes.



Veerabhadra swamy temple is built with beautiful architecture. There is a statue of nandi in front of the temple. You have to climb a few steps for the temple and have darshan of the lord.



The beauty of the temple is that it is built on huge granite stones. Some of the boulders are more than 50 feet high. They look very terrific and magical.



You can see Siddheshwara beta from the Veerabhadra Temple hill top, which looks very tiny from about 4 kms distance. But if you have a zoom binocular or video camera you can see the hill clear with 30x –40x zoom.

If you are going on Ramanagaram - Kanakapura road, don’t forget to give a halt at this place. Even if you are going on Bangalore-Mysore road it is worth driving 15 kms inside to visit this temple.

How to reach there


If you are going from Bangalore, you can go straight on Mysore highway till Ramanagara. Then go further for 5 Kms more, you will see Janapadaloka at your right. If you are coming from Mysore then you will cross Channapatna and go further till you find it at your left before you reach Ramanagara. If you are going by bus, you can go upto Ramanagara by bus, and then take some local conveyance till Janapadaloka. The signboard of Janapadaloka is quite huge and prominently visible from distance.


The entry fee


There is a ticket counter near the entrance gate. There is plenty of parking place on the highway side. We parked the car there and got the entrance tickets. The tickets were like:

Entry fee: Rs 10 per person, Kids – Rs 5

Camera fees: Rs 100 (if you want to take pictures inside museums)

Video show – Rs 5 (there are specific timings of the show)

Timmings: 9.00 am To 5.30 pm, Tuesday holiday


The entrance gate or mahadwara


The entrance gate is one of the attractions of Janapadaloka. A majestic door adorned with Harige and Trumpets and tall brass Nandidwajas on either side of the pathway enhance the grandeur of the entrance. We were there during July 2011 and there was a workshop for drum beating (Charma Vadya Sibira) was going on during that time.


Lokamata Mandira


Lokamatha Mandira is a museum displaying articles of daily use of folk people like cooking vessels, equipments used for farming and animal husbandry and other such rural activities.


Chithra Kuteera


""Chithra Kuteera"" which reflects different stages of the founder's literary achievements and struggle during the building of Janapada Loka and also houses photographs of different folk art forms of Karnataka.


Loka Mahal


""Loka Mahal"" is a two-storied building where more than 5000 folk artifacts are aesthetically displayed. The artifacts include agricultural, hunting and fishing implements, weapons, ingenious household gadgets, masks, dolls and shadow puppets etc.


Doddamane


A community house called “Doddamane"" built in the traditional rural style. It serve as a place for workshops and seminars. During that period there was a workshop on drum beating and we had an opportunity to see the fantastic drum beating show.


The Garden and Lake


When you go inside you find gardens and a lake (known as Loka Sarobara). Some people say that there was boating facility in the lake, but we did not see any boat there. We saw an attractive logo board of Janapadaloka made in the lawn.



Behind the lake, there are some interesting cottages. They are just empty and don’t seem to be used for any purpose. However, they look pretty attractive like tribal cottages.


Cafeteria


There are various other things to see in the campus, such as, art gallery, amphitheatre, playground for children, gardens and statues etc. There was also a canteen inside the campus. We enjoyed some tea and snacks in the canteen, although the items were highly overpriced than outside.

.
Something additional


The most attractive item for us was drum-beating event. A group of 20 participants were demonstrating their drum beating with various styles and dances. We took a full video of their drum beating and enjoyed for long time.

Drinking water and toilets are available inside Janapadaloka. I did not see certain things which I was expecting, but I saw many more things which I had never expected. It is a must go for people traveling frequently between Bangalore and Mysore.

We visited this place after visiting Ramadevara beta and Siddheswhar beta as all these are close to Ramanagara. If you are combining more than one place in your tour you should start early to give enough time to each of the place.

How to reach there



Sri Revana Siddeshwara Betta is about 65 km from Bangalore. You have to go straight on Mysore road till Ramanagaram. From Ramanagaram take left turn towards Kanakpura. Siddheswar Beta is 13 km from Ramanagaram situated near Avverahalli along Ramanagara-Kanakapura Road. The road is motorable and good.

Route of Bangalore to Sri Revana Siddeshwara Betta: Bangalore–(take Mysore Road)–12 km–>Kengeri–18 km–>Bidadi–20 km–>Ramanagaram–take left turn towards kanakapura ->13 km–>Sri Revana Siddeshwara Betta


About the place



Rebena Siddheshwar beta is famous for Siddheshwar temple. It is also popular among the trekkers and rock climbers. It is better to visit this place in winter as you may feel very tiring to climb hills in summer. We went there during August 2011.

There are totally 3 temples in the hill complex– at the top is Revanna Siddeshwara temple, midway is Bheemeshwari (named after the pandava Bheema) and Renukamba temple at the base. We first went to Renukamba temple which is at the foot of the hill.



After visiting Renukamba temple one has to go up to the hill. The hill is made of huge granite stones, very attractive to look. If you have a vehicle you can ride up, otherwise you can take the steps.



Behind me (above) is the huge stone hill. The left side road is for vehicles, the right side steps are for pedestrians. While going on this road we saw the temple chariot.



This temple is famous in Karnataka and visited by devotees from all over Karnataka, The hill is more than 3000 feet above the sea level. The main Idol is in the cave temple on the hill. The place has rich history linked with the Gangas, Kempegowda and Tipu Sultan.



This is the Siddheswhar temple on the top of the hill. The outside views from this hill are very attractive. It is worth visiting the place.
Other nearby places



Ramgad or Ramadevara Beta is also near Ramanagara. If you start early you can plan to combine visiting Siddheshwar beta with Ramadevara beta.

Ramanagara is famous for its silk market, one of the biggest silk market in India, known as Silk town.

Kengal hanumantharaaya temple is nearest visiting place in ramanagara City. One may have food in Lokaruchi (Kamat group) and visit Janapada loka just next to Kamat Lokaruchi.

Mysore Palace
We checked into the Chandra Palace Hotel (not as fancy as it sounds) around 8:00 a.m. on the 8th. Although the room was pretty big and fairly nice, we were informed that whoever had told us the price per night was misinformed, and the already overpriced room was actually more expensive than we'd been told. The staff there was also rather cranky, so we decided to stay one night then move to a much cheaper, though slightly smaller and grungier, place the next day. Unfortunately we realized that Mysore isn't the best place for tourist lodging, in that most hotels are filthy, overpriced, loud, and smell like smoke. We managed fine, though.

After a post-overnight bus nap, we spent our first afternoon in the city touring Mysore's trademark Maharaja's Palace, once home to the 24th Wadiyar raja. The palace was very beautiful with brightly painted ceilings and columns, as well as amazing hand carved wooden doors. However, its upkeep and preservation appeared to be lacking, which was unfortunate considering its intricate craftmanship. We were required to take our shoes off to enter the palace, and, since the floor had obviously not been cleaned in quite awhile (if ever), this was
Palace Gate
pretty gross. Also, similar to when we visited the museum in Mumbai, all of the Indian tourists were pushing and shoving to get ahead of one another, making the pathway through the palace rather cramped. One interesting thing we noticed (and have continued to notice since) is the way security is handled in India. There were security guards at the palace ""checking"" people's bags - basically by simply glancing inside them with little to no rummaging around - and there were metal detectors that everyone chose to walk through despite the fact that the guards supposedly operating them were off in the corner smoking cigarettes. The metal detector beeped every five seconds, hopefully from people's jewelry, belts, etc., but the guards paid no mind. You could easily smuggle something inside and no one would even know. On the contrary, when we visited a fancy bookstore in the city, we had to leave our bags at the door, get searched and go through a metal detector that actually had a guard on duty. Apparently shoplifting is a bigger concern in Mysore than someone blowing up the palace. But who am I to judge?

Our second day began with lunch at
Sweet Shop
a great little place we found in KR Circle, one of the main eating/shopping areas in town. A nice British couple sat down at our table (it's pretty common for strangers to share tables in India when a place is busy, and so far it's been a great way for us to meet and talk to people!) so we spent a good hour or so talking to them before going our separate ways. Afterward, we bought some famous Mysore pak from the well known Guru Sweet Shop across the street. This delicious melt-in-your-mouth treat has a similar consistency to sugar cookie dough, and I'm pretty sure its main ingredients are pure butter and sugar... a few bites and you're good to go, but Scott and I overindulged a few times. Then we stopped by the market and bought the tiniest and best bananas I've ever had in my life. Yum!

Our next destination was the government operated Cauvery's Arts and Crafts Emporium. These emporiums are scattered throughout India and sell a variety of the region's handicrafts at a (supposedly) reasonable price. We browsed through the silk products, jewelry, paintings, incense and sandalwood carvings. We wanted to buy a sandalwood
Chamundeswari Temple
sculpture, but they were way too expensive, so we bought two paintings which had been painted on leaves - very cool - some incense and some sandalwood soap. While we were there, we ran into an American man whose daughter graduated from Clemson and talked to him for a bit. Then we went to the bus station and took a public bus to Chamundi Hill, which was probably the scariest bus ride of my life. Apparently it's perfectly fine to speed around blind curves while going up a mountain past other buses that are coming down. Oh, and you can pass cars on curves. In a giant bus. On a mountain. We almost died. Anyways...when we got there, alive, thankfully, we toured the 12th century temple, which was impressive on the outside, but a bit underwhelming overall. There was a shrine inside containing a solid gold statue of a god, but we weren't allowed to get close enough to get a good view of it. The most interesting thing we saw were several extremely fat, presumably pregnant monkeys hanging around the temple. Since it was a hazy day and the view wasn't wonderful, we began our descent via the 1,000
Nandi (Shiva's Vehicle)
something steps down. (There was no way we were taking another bus!) At the bottom, we looked around for a rickshaw to take back to our hotel. Unsure of how much to pay for one, we approached a police officer who was sitting in his car nearby. He was very friendly and helpful, asked us a lot of questions about ourselves, and ultimately got us what we think was a really good deal for a rickshaw without us having to haggle.

The next day, neither of us were feeling very well and we'd already seen most of the sights, so we decided to have a lazy day relaxing. This consisted of Scott napping while I did all of our laundry in a bucket in the bathroom then hung it to dry on the huge spider web of a clothesline I constructed in our room with some rope we'd brought. Very relaxing. The following day we were off on the night train to Kochi, located south of Mysore in the state of Kerala.

Interesting fact: apparently (and quite unfortunately) we barely missed a harvest festival in Mysore where they paint all the cows yellow and their horns various colors,
Tiger!
then make them jump over fire. I was wondering why it looked like someone had taken a highlighter to all the cows...

Marche - villageoise
Bijapur est une ville plus grande, approx. 200 000 habitants, en majorité musulmans. On a eu une belle surprise en découvrant une ville assez calme (sauf la Station Road évidement), avec des habitants très accueillants, ouverts, sociables et souriants. On est arrives dimanche alors on s'est précipites aller voir le marche. Quelle fête! Des femmes d'une ethnie très spéciale, qui habitent un village a 15 km de Bijapur, viennent vendre leur produits au marche. On n'osait pas les prendre en photos mais elles sont très gentilles et se laissent prendre en photo sans problème. D'ailleurs la majorité des gens au marche nous demandaient de prendre des photos d'eux. La joie quoi! On a profite au max et on se sentait comme des enfants fou. On a fait plein de photos.
Les autres jours nous avons visite les attraits historico-artistiques: des mausolées des sultans musulmans du XVI- XVII s, des vieilles mosquées. On s'est même balade en tonga, petite charrette sur 2 roues tirée par un cheval. Nous avons passe 3 jours paisibles dans une grande chambre d'un hôtel très sympathique avec jardin au palmiers ou il faisait bon prendre son souper (resto végétarien sans alcool)Nous avons eu d'ailleurs assez souvent des
Marche - sucreries
chambres très grandes, avec sofa, TV écran plat (qu'on utilise pas) et salles de bain énormes. Des fois nous avons eu 3 lits, mais la plupart du temps il y a un lit double et on nous met un matelas pour la 3e personne. Nous avons eu toute sorte de douches, le summum étant une douche ""jacuzzi"" car l'eau jaillissait de partout les tuyaux étant perforés a plusieurs places! Nous n'avons pas tout le temps d'eau chaude mais ça ne nous dérange pas car elle est tiède et avec la chaleur nous n'avons pas besoin de plus.Nous quittons aujourd'hui l'état de Karnataka. Il nous a semble plus propre que Tamil Nadu, avec plus de ville aux trottoirs et moins de dépotoirs. La poussière est aussi présente que dans d'autre état, en dépit du fait qu'il y a beaucoup de verdure, car les routes sont très poussiéreuses. En Tamil Nadu le portrait de la première ministre était omniprésent (au point de la nausée) mais au Karnataka nous n'avons jamais vu de portrait politique et nous ne connaissons pas du tout le visage du premier ministre. J'ai lu dans un journal que cet état est très discret et je peux dire que
Marche - etal
c'est vrai.Rendez-vous dans l'état voisin!

February 18th 2013
Published: February 18th 2013


DSCN8320
Though it saddens me to begin this post on a negative note, I must say that the process of getting from Gokarna to Hampi was nothing less than a nightmare. After about a 45 minute ride, we arrived at the bus stop in Ankola around 8:00 p.m. via a public bus from Gokarna. Just to be on the safe side, we’d gotten there quite early (3 hours early, to be exact), so we had some time to kill. We read our books and eventually got some dinner, but as 11:00 p.m. rolled around, our bus was nowhere to be found. The staff working at the bus stop withheld whatever information they had about our bus’s whereabouts, but occasionally we overheard talk about either an accident or a breakdown… In any case, we waited for a total of 6 hours before a bus – which wasn’t even the bus we paid for – showed up at 2:00 a.m. Since everything else was full when we booked our tickets, we’d paid 2,000 rupees for an A/C sleeper, but we ended up having to cram into a seater bus with several other disgruntled travelers, one of whom snored loudly and had frequent night terrors.
DSCN8134
We assumed we would get our money back, but when we contacted the company they said the most we could get back was 200 rupees, since supposedly the bus that was sent for us cost 900 rupees apiece (the fact that this was not the bus we paid for or that it was 3 hours late didn’t seem to factor into this wonderful customer service…). In the end, we decided to cut our losses, move on, and enjoy our time in Hampi.

We pulled into the ancient town around 8:00 a.m. and were immediately greeted by at least a dozen rickshaw drivers who were so eager to take us one place or another that they literally blocked the door to the bus, preventing us from exiting without being squished like sardines. When we finally broke down and told them where we were staying, we got one strangely low offer after another – one guy even said he would drive us for free. This is when we realized we were within about a two minute’s walking distance from our guesthouse, and these guys were just trying to get in our good graces so we would allow one of them to
DSCN8162
act as our tour guide and drive us around all day for a pretty penny. After we wised up, we began walking and were astonished (and annoyed) to find the rickshaw drivers had not yet given up and were driving alongside us, still shouting out offers. It was rather stifling and overwhelming, especially after barely getting any sleep, but they eventually left us alone and we were able to find our guesthouse, where we immediately passed out for 3 hours.

When we woke up, we decided to explore some of Hampi’s ruins near our guesthouse to get a feel for the ancient city. A bit of info about Hampi: imagine a surreal landscape of giant boulders balanced delicately but sturdily atop one another for miles in every direction. This wondrous natural landscape was once home to Vijayanagar, the ancient “City of Victory” whose ruins surround the winding River Tungabhadra. This popular tourist destination for Indians and Westerners alike used to be a thriving Hindu kingdom, but was attacked and ultimately defeated by Muslim invaders in 1565, leaving only what are now the ruins of Hampi, which, due to weather and a lack of proper preservation, are in danger of
DSCN8213
continuous erosion and destruction. For now, however, the ruins are a marvelous spectacle – definitely worth even the most horrible of bus rides to see.

Being in Hampi feels like being in another era or world. One can view ruins of impressive buildings and temples, as well as giant sculptures of Hindu gods, and there is even evidence of an ancient, sophisticated irrigation system, which is still used today to feed the city’s banana farms. On our second day there, we rented an old automatic motorcycle (whose condition was questionable) so that we could cover more ground. We began at the Archaeological Museum – not terribly interesting, but it did have a good model of all the ruins, helping to put our surroundings into perspective. We then continued to the remnants of the Royal Enclosure, where we wandered around for a long time. There, we were surrounded by school children on field trips who were fascinated by us, wanting to know our names, where we were from and if we’d take pictures of/with them. I’m pretty sure they were more interested in our digital camera than they were in us…but they were seriously adorable.

On our way out,
DSCN8249
we passed a teenage boy selling postcards. As we got closer, I noticed that he had cerebral palsy or a similar condition, but I also noticed his wide, happy smile, bright eyes and mop of shaggy hair. I couldn’t help but go over and talk to him. As I browsed his merchandise, he answered our questions about Hampi, and we talked for a bit. He was happy to talk with us, asking us about America and giving us directions to the various ruins we wanted to see. I gave him 20 rupees, as well as (to his surprise and delight) our last, crumpled American dollar, and left with a postcard and a lasting impression caused by a kindhearted boy with a big, beautiful smile.

Our next stop was Vitthala Temple, where we ran into, by chance, our German cabin mate from our train ride to Arambol. That night, we went back to our guesthouse to shower and get ready for bed, but as soon as Scott went into the bathroom, he saw a rat on the windowsill! It seemed even more surprised to see us as we were to see it, and, in its attempt to run away, it
DSCN8375
fell into the toilet and began flailing about. For a rat, it was actually quite cute (I think it was a baby), and I felt bad for the poor thing – I knew when we asked the owner to come remove it, it would end up as dinner for some lucky stray cat outside…which is precisely what happened. Sadness.

Our last day was spent checking out the nearby and impressive (and still in use) Virupaksha Temple, where we got to watch the temple elephant, Lakshmi, get “made up” for the day with colorful, chalky powder applied in religious Hindu designs. We were also surrounded by lots of loud, rambunctious monkeys, which was our cue to leave. Afterwards, we walked to some nearby ruins, got some lunch, and sat in a café reading until it was time to catch a local bus to Hospet where our sleeper bus would (hopefully) pick us up. We made it, bought some snacks, and hopped on our bus at 8:30 p.m. Aside from some brief motion sickness, a lack of bathroom stops (I had the lovely opportunity to relieve myself on the side of the road at 2:45 a.m. …), and my i-pod dying,
DSCN8155
the ride was smooth and comfortable, and we arrived safely to Mysore, our next destination.

India 001
(I wrote this weeks ago and have been meaning to edit it before posting it. However, I have giving in to the fact that I probably won't find the time to do this. So hear it is in the raw...)





This weekend we went to Mysor, about 5 hours drive from Shanti Bhavan. Much more open than other India cities and towns, the atmosphere felt a bit slowing and more relaxing. Though cars still packed the streets, the wideness of the main streets made the traffic less daunting. A weekend away in a lovely city, with lovely people, eating delicious food and seeing interesting sites: It was a good weekend.

We visited the Mysor Palace, the home of the Maharaja built during British rule. Architecturally the palace was stunning and interesting. Mixing Hindu and Gothic styles it is a building unlike any I have seen. Despite the beauty, I was revisited by this now familiar feeling of discomfort I experience whenever I see such extravagance. When our tour guide told us how many pounds of gold was used to make the Maharaja’s throne, or when he pointed out the ivory inlaid doors, I think he
India 002
meant to impress. I just felt sick.

I was interested to learn that most of the palace came from elsewhere. Stained glass from Scotland. Tiles from England. Chandelier from Belgium. Stone from somewhere. Brass from somewhere else. I don’t know why this surprises me. Foreign treasures are a sign of wealth, after all.

Much more I enjoyed going to Devaraja Market, a riot of colors and an scream of smells. Bright powdered pigment. Fruits and vegetables. Spices. Fragrant oils. Persistent shopkeepers asking me where I was from in order to coax me into a purchase. Though I am not good at haggling nor do I ever care to become practiced in the art, I am glad to have found myself in the middle of such a vibrant and bustling and beautiful mess.

That evening we had intended to visit some gardens, apparently beautiful at night. Unfortunately, due to a water dispute, the gardens were closed for the weekend. Instead, we went to temple on top of Chamundi Hill. It was beautiful. Overlooking, the city at sunset I felt I could breathe. The sky was soft, a swirl of purples and pinks. I was visited by another now
India 003
familiar feeling, thought this one more pleasant. A feeling of that the world is simultaneously incomprehensibly small and unfathomably huge. When I look at the sky, I feel at home. I am reminded that we all share the blue above us and the earth below. Although I am far from home, it is still the same air and same rock. But big. So, so big. So many steps. So much of this rock I have not, and will not, see. So much air between my lungs and yours.

The morning we went to a nature park. More lovely open air to breath. More beautiful things to see. We took a paddle boat ride in a lovely pond, that I afterwards learned is home to crocodiles. I saw peacocks and other birds of which I still do not know the name.

After lunch, we left Mysor for a small Tibetan village that somehow found itself in Southwest India. The monastery was peaceful. Winding paths through open space. The temples had vaulting ceilings in which the sound of chimes clung to the air. While I appreciated the tranquility of the place I am still baffled and a bit disturbed by
India 004
the need for building-tall golden statues.

In my wanderings around the compound, I say many of the young monks. How strange it would be to grow up in a monastery. I suppose not much different than living in Shanti Bhavan. Away from family, living in dormitories, little time unscheduled or alone.

After dinner (for the record, we had gobi Manchurian at every lunch and dinner this weekend, and I am still not tired of it), I sat with Masha waiting for the others to do a bit of shopping. We talked about her leaving. How I dread it, but do not fear it because I know that we will see each other again. We talked about traveling and what the future might hold. Now that I have seen more of the world, I realize how little of it I have scene. How little I know. Now that I have started, I don’t want to stop. I want to see as much as I can. To taste, hear, smell, and try to understand more of this small, gigantic rock. Now that I am moving, it is hard to stop. In our conversation, I realized how awake I had felt
India 005
all weekend. I don’t want that feeling to go away.

The drive back was longer than our trip to Mysor, as the Tibetan village was an hour outside of the city in the opposite direction from the school. We pasted the time playing games and chatting, but eventually our conversation would give way to silence as we watched the nightscape zoom past. As the hour grew later, traffic increased. For the first time since being in India, I saw accidents. It was horrible. A man on the side of the road surrounded by a cluster of helping hands. Later, we saw another crowd of people. A bloody man leaning against a knelling figure waiting as another called for help. And then later, a man prostrate on the road a friend or stranger talking to him a motorcycle yards away. I am grateful that every accident we saw was met with by a crowd of good Samaritans. But I ache to think of how long it probably took for medical help to arrive. As I tried to push thoughts of the men’s families from my head, I thought of my own. The distance between us felt larger than it ever
India 006
has. Met by the sudden shock and sadness of an accident, all I wanted was to be home. My desire to keep moving was replaced by a longing to be still and to be with the people I love.

Such a hard thing to balance, the desire for new and exciting, and the need for the familiar and beloved. I wrote in a poem, “Sometimes it feels like wings used to be there or will be there. Sometimes it feels like my feet extend into the ground, roots weaving their way deep, to the source of something. Is the answer above or below. Above of below? Below of above?”



Thankful for…

Badami - les ""montagnes""
Elles sont faites comme un fort, mais ici il y avait aussi un vrai fort
On s'est arrache a la magie et chaleur de Hampi (+37C la dernière journée) pour continuer notre voyage dans le coeur de l'Inde du sud. C'est le pays de la civilisation/dynastie chalukya qui a régné ici du Ve au XIIe siècle. Hampi est l'apogée de leurs créations en sculptures et en construction de temples, alors nous avons remonte vers le berceau de cet art magnifique: Badami, Aihole et Pattadakal. On voit bien l'évolution de la construction de temples (au début les temples étaient dans des caves, avec des sculptures incroyables, par après ils ont commence a construire eux même des bâtisses, ornées toujours par de magnifiques sculptures).Mais au delà de l'attrait artistique de ces petites villes et villages, il y a le retour dans le temps. Car dans cette région le temps semble être arrêté il y a plus de 1000 ans. Il y a des vieux arbres magnifiques qui protègent par leur voûte majestueuse la route et au delà, il y a les champs vert de riz, de tournesol, de céréales, et les gens qui travaillent enveloppes dans un tissu, pieds nus, avec une herse. Des fois ils labourent avec une charrue tirée par 2 boeufs. Dans les villages, les
Badami - vers les caves
maisons sont construites accotées sur les murs des temples. Les femmes passent les céréales aux tamis fait en pailles. Les chars tirés par des boeufs passent lentement. Seuls témoins tristes de notre époque, les bouteilles en plastic et les plats en aluminium au bord des routes! Les chalukya ont profite d'une belle chaîne de petites montagnes aplaties, qui donne l'impression d'un fort sans fin. La roche rouge a servi a construire de vrais forts de défense, mais aussi des beaux temples sculptes. Le centre de Badami, ou nous avons loge, est infernal le soir, mais autrement tout est paisible et intemporel. Seul bémol, les jeunes enfants qui sont plus tannant qu'ailleurs et beaucoup plus persistant a demander des crayons, chocolats, argent, n'importe quoi. A croire que c'est la faute des touristes qui leur ont donne des mauvaises habitudes!Nous nous réfugions le soir dans le jardin de notre hôtel, a l'écart du bruit et de a folie, pour siroter une bière Kingfisher strong (nous, es filles) et admirer les singes venues se coucher dans l'arbre a cote, pendant qu'on mangeait avec plaisir notre masala. On est comme en ""automne"", alors c'est e temps du melon d'eau et des raisins. On achète
Badami - sculpture dans une cave VI s
souvent des melons, des raisins, des bananes, saputas (petit fruit banal, beige, mais très sucre a l'intérieur) et papayas. On profite pour manger ces fruits mûris au soleil. Cote bouffe, on aime beaucoup les plats, très relevés d'ailleurs! Huguette s'est habituée et elle mange presqu'aussi piquant que nous autres. On n'a pas réussi a maigrir (sauf Antoine) car on se gave de bonnes choses.

Asia » India » Rajasthan » Jaisalmer
February 14th 2015

The overnight train to Jaisalmer was great, because we again had a 2 berth cabin to ourselves, and a good long sleep. Still not very well, especially Fred, and so took it very very easy in Jaisalmer. I went to the chemist while Fred was asleep and sought advice....was expecting to buy diarolyte or similar...but instead they sold me some antibiotics. I was a bit dubious about over the counter antibiotics like this; having spent years working for the NHS where everything is highly regulated, and antibiotics individually prescribed and packaged with a patient information leaflet. Anyway, my doubts proved unjustified, as the antibiotics worked like magic as a cure. Fred was able to enjoy watching India/Pakistan cricket on TV in bed, and I was able to enjoy a feelgood Bollywood film with english subtitles in the roof restuarant later that day.

Jaisalmer is quite a small town surrounded by desert with sandy looking soil, small scrubby trees and the occasional goats or camel. It has quite a nice unthreatening smalltown feel to it, and less litter than other places we have been to in India. (We saw an old lady collecting old plastic bottles in a sack.....similar to New

York where we saw elderly chinese doing this....dont know if she gets money for recycling them). Both girls and boys are out playing hopscotch and bike riding in the small street near the hotel. The hotel has an amazing view of the old sandstone fort from the rooftop, and a bit of a laidback hippy feel to it (hammock and cushions on roof). As the rooms sell out the manager puts 2 person pop up tents, for a cheaper rent, up on the roof!

We were not up to adventurous stuff like camel riding in the desert because of our health, but able to walk around the old town inside the fort and visit the City Palace when feeling better. Here every building has beautiful patterned stonework, but this is especially intricate in the city palace and around the walls of the Jain temple. The sandstone buildings look especially lovely in the late afternoon sun.

Mysore - marche, fleurs
Nous sommes maintenant dans l'etat de Karnataka ou les gens parlent kannada! De quoi se meler quand ils nous demandent d'ou nous venons, hi! hi!

MYSORE - coup de coeur

On appelle Mysore la ville de palais. Tipu Sultan avait construit 7 et le maharaja en a rajoute d'autres. Mais ce n'est pas seulement a cause de ça qu'elle est notre coup de coeur. C'est une ville raisonnablement grande (approx. 800 000 habitants), propre, sans trop de mendiants, avec de beaux trottoirs, de grands boulevards et de rond points immenses au milieu desquels il y a de belles statues (Tipu Sultan, le dernier maharaja, Ghandi, etc). Les chauffeurs de tuk-tuk ne sont ni trop agressifs ni trop trompeurs! Il y a une belle atmosphère d'un autre siècle. Le soir au bazar c'est ahurissant de couleurs et odeurs. Les commerçants sont souriants et pas mal doués (un jeune garçon de 10 ans a réussi a nous convaincre a acheter d'huile essentiel sans qu'on aie besoin!).
Le palais du maharaja, qui a seulement 100 ans (parce que le vieux qui était en bois est passe au feu) est absolument superbe, avec un mix d'architecture indo-saracenique, des vitraux, plafonds peints et planchers
Mysore - arche, vendeur de parfums
en mosaïque avec le même motif, peintures murales décrivant la vie au temps du raj! Une merveille! Encore plus charmant le palais d'été de Tipu Sultan, qui se trouve sur une petite île au nord de la ville. Un vrai bijoux en bois peint, au milieu d'un jardin paisible, au bord de la rivière! Huguette et moi avons passe la journée la pendant qu'Antoine prenait un ""break"". C'était idyllique et il y avait multitudes d'oiseaux de tous les couleurs. Et pour sceller notre souvenir, un souper a la chandelle sur le toit-terrasse d'un bon resto, arose par une bonne biere Kingfischer (la 3e du voyage pour les filles car Antoine ne veut pas nous accompagner!)

BENGALURU - a éviter pour l'instant

C'est une grande métropole de presque 6 millions d'habitants. Elle nous a accueilli avec le mix habituel des grandes villes: pollution, dépotoirs en bord de route, odeurs désagréables, traffic d'enfer. Le tout exacerbe par le chantier immense du nouveau métro. Donc plus d'embouteillages, déchets, pollution!. Heureusement il y a des parcs immenses et magnifiques (40 et 120 ha!) ou tu oublies complètement que tu te trouves dans ce capharnaüm. C'est d'ailleurs une ville très dynamique et presque
Mysore - marche, fruits
20 000 d'étrangers vivent et travaillent la. La ville est très prisée par les jeunes car il y a plusieurs malls comme dans les pays occidentaux, mais les malls ne sont pas notre passion! On l'a quitte sans regret mais contents de l'avoir vu quand-même.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Gokarna
February 9th 2013
Published: February 11th 2013


Decorated chariot (not exactly sure about its purpose)
Our journey from Arambol to Gokarna, a sacred seaside town in the state of Karnataka, directly below Goa on India’s west coast, began with a train ride from Pernhem station to Margao. When we arrived in Margao a few hours later, we bought tickets for the “express” train to Gokarna. This train would supposedly arrive sooner and get us to Gokarna faster than the normal train, but, as it turned out, the slower train was on time and left on time, while our train was an hour and a half late! Once we were finally on the train, we had to search for empty seats, as it was rather crowded, and we ended up sitting in one of the last cars alongside a group of beggar children and an elderly man who appeared to be with them. One of the children was a toddler and was sitting barefoot and naked on the floor, occasionally picking up trash and putting it in his mouth with no supervision. Each of the older children asked us and the other passengers for money multiple times, but they made such a ruckus by yelling loudly and running back and forth from car to car, climbing all
The walk from town to the beach
over the seats (and sometimes over people), that we eventually became irritated by them.

I must admit that, while I did sympathize with these children, I instinctively, perhaps without good reason, felt the need to keep a close eye on my things for fear that they might try to swipe something. I could probably attribute this fear to books I’ve read and movies I’ve seen that portray street children in a negative light, but, unfortunately, I’ve learned that in India it can be a reasonable concern. Ultimately, everything was fine, and, as we stepped off the train at the Gokarna station, the children leaned out the windows waving and yelling goodbye to us.

We took a rickshaw into town around 4:30 p.m. and were dropped off at our guesthouse, the Haripriya Residency. Our host came out to greet us immediately, showing us to our incredibly spacious and clean room and then serving us masala chai in her living room. The couple who own the guesthouse built it as their own and later added several rooms. We sat and talked with her awhile about her family and the town, and she happily gave us advice for sightseeing as well
This lizard loved to pose for the camera!
as recommendations for dinner. Then we set out to explore a bit.

We were happy to find that Gokarna is far less touristy than Arambol. Though its main street is dotted with souvenir shops, it actually felt like an Indian town where not everyone is in the tourist business. Gokarna is considered a very sacred site, attracting pilgrims from all over India who want to dip their feet into the sea’s holy water. We quickly discovered, however, that the holy beach is not really a good place to hang out or swim because it is littered with trash and cow pies. This seemed quite strange to us, since the other beaches in the town are very clean and beautiful. We’ve come to realize during our time in India that littering is widely practiced and accepted – it’s simply part of the culture. Unlike Americans who are raised on the notion that littering is unacceptable and bad for the earth, Indians as a whole devote little time, money or energy toward protecting the environment, perhaps because that’s how they were raised and how it’s always been, or perhaps because they have more immediate issues to concern themselves with. Either way,
Our first glimpse of the beach
though I find it difficult not to cringe when I see someone throw a plastic bottle on the ground when there’s a trash can right next to them, I have to remind myself that this culture I have chosen to immerse myself in is beautiful in as many ways as it differs from my own.

Another cultural difference between India and America is it’s view and treatment of cows as holy creatures. They are not killed or eaten, but are left alone to roam freely throughout the towns, or even on the beaches if they like. You definitely have to watch where you step, no matter where you happen to be walking! It’s a bit sad, however, because, since the cows are sacred and believed to be cared for and protected by the gods, no one feeds or takes care of them; therefore, there are a good many very thin, unhealthy cows roaming about eating trash or whatever they can find. While in Gokarna, we actually witnessed a cow fight, which I had never seen before. Interestingly, to break up the fight between these sacred animals, the townspeople began beating them with sticks. I suppose their intentions were in
Tourists by the water
the cows’ best interest, but it was somewhat difficult to watch.

As far as sightseeing goes, we spent one full day exploring nearby Kudlee Beach and Om Beach. We followed the trail from the town and reached the first beach in about half an hour. We then walked along the water until we reached the trail that led to Om Beach (which is actually shaped like an Om symbol). It was nice to find this beach to be far less crowded and touristy than Arambol. Additionally, there was a similar number of Indian visitors as westerners, which was a nice change. However, we did see the occasional westerner sporting a thong, as well as one man casually changing out of his bathing suit on the beach. Side note: never in my life have I been in a holy city and seen so many grown men walking the streets and beach in their underwear...granted, it's better than wearing a thong or going completely nude, but I can assure you that this practice of men strolling about in their skivvies is, well, simply not okay.

Anyway, as we walked to Om Beach, we met a Swedish gentleman who accompanied us
Such an amazing view
for much of the way. He was an interesting character, but nice to talk to. Once we got to the beach, we stopped for lunch and then decided to follow a trail we found along the cliffs next to the water. We found some amazing views of the surrounding landscape, but as we continued to follow the trail, it started to become less and less of a trail and increasingly more difficult to navigate. Despite our better judgment, we decided to keep on trekking since we’d already walked for a long time. At this point both Scott and I slid on loose rocks and fell – I was fine, but Scott bruised his rear end pretty badly. Still, we went on…

Eventually, Scott found what resembled a very overgrown trail through the jungle, and, after going ahead of me to check it out, he reported that it did in fact come out at our destination…if I was up for an adventurous, slightly cramped and questionably dangerous jungle hike. I figured I’d come this far, so I might as well give it a shot. Scott was right, though. We found ourselves ducking under branches and vines, attempting (and sometimes failing)
The landscape was incredible
to avoid thorns, climbing over rocks, walking across a very unstable “bridge” composed of intertwined vines and leaves, and basically trying not to get seriously injured. Luckily we made it out with a few scratches and minor sunburns, guzzled some celebratory water, and called it a day.

The following day, we walked around window shopping and ate lunch at a great little restaurant we found with generously portioned thalis and delicious homemade ice cream. Aside from that, we just waited for the 6:30 p.m. public bus that would transport us to Ankola, where we would then catch an overnight bus to Hampi.

As we waited, our wonderful hosts served us fresh papaya along with chai and cookies (which they didn’t charge us for) and sat down to talk with us for awhile. This was when I came upon the realization that they had assumed that I was Indian during our entire stay…something about my teeth, complexion, clothes, and, I’m assuming, my nose ring gave them this impression. They said that if I walked around in a sari and wore a bindi, there would be no question. I found this to be interesting, and, to be honest, took it
Om Beach
as a compliment since, by not standing out so much as a westerner, I felt that perhaps I was succeeding in respecting the local culture. This, of course, is not to say that being a westerner is a bad thing, but if you walk around in tank tops, booty shorts, bathing suits or worse in a country where it’s considered disrespectful to show your shoulders or knees (and anything in between), it doesn’t make a very good impression. Another reason I was surprised to be mistaken as an Indian in both Arambol and Gokarna was due to the fact that, in Mumbai and other cities, people from small villages viewed me as a novelty and wanted their picture made with me because I’m white…funny, isn’t it?

When the time came, we said goodbye to our hosts and thanked them for their hospitality, then took the short bus ride to Ankola where our sleeper bus was scheduled to arrive at 11:00 p.m. We got to the bus stop (a skuzzy old hotel) early, ate some dinner and read for a few hours, but when 11:00 rolled around, our bus was nowhere to be found. We figured it was just running
A cow catching some rays
late, but, as the hours passed, we began to acknowledge that it may not be coming. The people working at the station laughed our situation off, saying “This is India” every time we inquired about our bus. Eventually, at 2:00 a.m. a bus from the company we’d booked with arrived, but, since it wasn’t a sleeper, we assumed it wasn’t ours. We were wrong. Apparently something had happened to the bus we’d booked (and paid handsomely for), and our option was to take the seater bus or nothing. So, after a cramped, sleepless night sitting next to a snorer who had night terrors, we arrived in Hampi with no explanation or promise of a refund… All part of the adventure, right? On the bright side, we thoroughly enjoyed our time in Gokarna, and as you’ll soon find out, the trip to Hampi, as frustrating and tiresome as it may have been, was well worth it.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Mangalore
February 6th 2013
Published: February 6th 2013


Friday 1 February – Saturday 2 February

There is not really much to say about the 1st and 2nd of February except that we are all really sad to have come to the end of this fantastic experience. We have been back in Mangalore, definitely my favourite place in India. We flew to Mumbai to get our flight to Heathrow and have noticed the biggest slum I have ever seen directly beside the runway in Mumbai, covering three sides of the airport perimeter. We didn’t see anything like this in Karnataka. We can see kids playing cricket, houses stacked on top of each other, yet most of them have satellite dishes, and I’m wondering how they ever have any privacy or ever protect their belongings? As our flight is delayed by two hours, due to a technical fault, and we are more than likely to miss our connecting flight to Manchester, now that we have take full advantage of the British Airways hospitality, I suppose it would be a good time to sum up my month in Karnataka…..

I have been making notes throughout the month about the things that have surprised or intrigued me the most about India. I say India loosely as I am now well aware that South India is so different to North India. We have only discovered one very small part of India and maybe one day I can visit the North to find out the differences in culture. So, in no particular order, these are my thoughts:

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Indian Standard Time
Even before I arrived in India, I had read about IST. It’s know as Indian Standard Time (Like GMT) but widely known as Indian Stretchable Time. The Indian’s themselves will admit that they have no real concept of time and if they say they will be there at 8am it will be 9am before they arrive. It gives the country a relaxed feel but it’s hard for us British to adapt. At home, I’m very punctual and always like to be early for appointments. By the end of the trip I have adapted and when somebody says ‘be ready for breakfast at 8am’, I take at least an extra 20 minutes to wash and dry my hair and put some make up on. Even then, in some homes I have time for a tour and a look at the photo albums before breakfast is served!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Driving
I have mentioned the traffic and driving skills a few times in the blog already and Emily has also added a whole post dedicated to the transport here. I don’t know what else to say except it has to be seen to be believed! I tried to take a few videos but even they don’t capture the bedlam of the road system. I can’t see any logic except ‘only the strong and brave survive’! At home we wait to get onto a roundabout. Here, we all pile onto the roundabout and then toot at each other to get off the roundabout. Our driver Nagaraj is great and the only time we have felt a bit worried was when we say other vehicles heading straight towards us on a bend. Although they drive on the same side of the road as us, I challenge any British person to drive here. Good luck! It will take a very brave person!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Religion
Before I went to India, I’m quite ashamed to admit that I was not really familiar with the various religions which I would come across. Between us, we stayed with Hindu, Muslim and Christian families during our month in Karnataka. We also visited various churches and Hindu and Jain temples. We could regularly hear the prayers and chanting coming from Muslim mosques. We commented on the final day that we couldn’t capture this sound to let others experience it. Anybody who has been to Turkey will to doubt be familiar with it. Having spent a month here, asking endless questions and watching the various different styles of worship, I can admit that although I have learned a lot, I will never fully understand these religions. They are complex and fascinating and having 30,000 Hindu idols is something I can’t get my head around. I don’t know how the Indian people get their head around this. What I did like was their passion and dedication. Their beliefs are admirable and I am almost feel that I am missing out by not having such beliefs. Personally, I am not religious. I have never been christened and I never plan to get married in a Church. The majority of my friends are the same. It’s very hard for Indian people to understand this. One woman actually told me that I had lost my faith and I need to learn to believe again. At the time I was quite upset by this. It is a surprise for people here to learn that the majority of people in the UK don’t go to Church every Sunday. One nice aspect of the religion here was that we all got involved in the Hindu style of worship. All of the Hindu families I stayed with had a pooja room, or at least a visible shine which they worship every day. In one home, the wife hit a very large symbol in the early morning and late at night while the husband carried out the candle lighting and praying rituals. When they asked me to join in, they were surprised that I knew what to do with the holy water and the candle. However, as I was almost at the end of the trip, it would have been impossible for me not to know what to do when they asked me to get involved ion their prayers.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Hand holding
I don’t think I will ever get used to seeing men being so affectionate to each other. During my time here, I have not seen any two Indian women holding hands or even being truly affectionate to each other (although I regularly hug the women). At least three times I day I have seen Indian men, from young boys to middle aged men holding hands as they walk down the beach, chat at a Rotary meeting or walk down a busy street. It is completely normal here and is by no means a sign of their sexuality. I picked up a copy of a weekly magazine here and read a sex survey which was quite revealing and openly states that homosexuality is still completely frowned upon in India. Yet, if we saw this kind of hand holding at home we would automatically assume that these people were gay. There is nothing at all wrong with this practice, yet it does seem so unfamiliar to us. Only in Ibiza have I seen anything similar! I asked one of my hosts about how common it was for young heterosexual couples to hold hands or show each other affection (I had seen it at the mall and was shocked) and he said that although youngsters were doing it, it was not readily accepted in India.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Being a minority
I had never expected that when I came to India that I would be classed as a minority. I think that I expected to be going to areas where they receive a lot of international tourists and are used to seeing white faces. However, on more than one occasion we were stared at, laughed at and asked for photos. To start with, we obliged, particularly for the under tens. However, when it was day 20 and grown adults were pointing at us and making us stand for photo after photo, it got to a point where we were fed up. Even in a temple, we were approached about five times to have photos taken. It made our visits less enjoyable but more than anything it made us realise that this is perhaps how minorities feel in our own country. In the UK we are becoming much more tolerant. However, in the North, particularly Cumbria, it is rare to see a face which is not White British. Although most people are accepting of another colour or race, a minority of uneducated people are still very racist.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Superficial things versus family values
Most of the hosts we have lived with had lovely homes, beautiful silks and a nice lifestyle. However, superficial things in India don’t seem to be so important. At home, people take credit to furnish their homes with beautiful furniture and go on nice holidays. Something we learned from the families here is that money should be saved for the future, even if it’s just a little each month. The most important things in life are health, education, family and happiness. I think all Westerners could learn a lesson from this.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Friendly and hospitable people
One of the first things that we were told when we arrived in Indi is that the ‘Guest is God’ and Indian people look after their guests well. I can’t dispute this fact and I can honestly say that I have never received such hospitality before. We were looked after, cared for, and more importantly, welcomed into the family and made to feel like an old friend. I only hope that the hosts in the UK can live up to this when they welcome the Indian GSE team. It wasn’t just in the home though as every person we came across welcomed us and showed a real interest in finding out about us. They happily answered our questions about culture, family and foo. They even made their food a little less spicy to help us along!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Importance of education
Parents and students alike place a lot of emphasis on the importance of education. In many cases, they are paying for private education as the Government run schools are not up to scratch. In every school or university we visited, the students seemed genuinely happy to be there, to be learning and to have opportunities opened up to them. We only stayed with middle class families but from what I could see, this was consistent across the classes. Even the children of the lower classes are now educated ad they have aspirations much higher than their parents. Sadly, I don’t think that education is rated so highly in the UK. Perhaps people take school education for granted as it is free here?

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Personal manners
Without offending anybody in India, I have to mention manners and the frequency of spitting, burping and going to the toilet in the street. I have lost count of the number of men I have seen going to the toilet in the street. Sadly, I have to say that I also saw a small child squatting in the street in one town. Yes, we see this at home on occasion. But here, it’s as regular as saying hello! Weeing in the street is a huge problem here. In some places the authorities have started to paint idols on the pavements and walls to prevent people going to the toilet there. The real problem is a lack of public facilities. Even those which are available are unhygienic or you have to pay to use them. To us, it’s a small price. To an Indian working on the roadside selling tender coconut, it’s not always possible to pay to go the toilet. When it comes to manners……. At the airport, in shops, at the temple, in restaurants, people are burping, sniffing, snorting. Even when they see us looking at them with shock, they ignore it. People are constantly spitting, including women, yet nobody bats an eyelid!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Mobile phones
Can anybody in the UK remember what life was like when they bought their first mobile phone? You had a loud ringtone and you were so pleased to have a phone that you answered it in very public places just so that people knew you had one. That was maybe 15 years ago. That is what life is like in India. At every Rotary meeting we have been at, people keep their phone turned on, it rings loudly, at least once an hour, and they answer it, no matter what they are doing. Many a time we have been presenting and people have sat in the audience, taking loudly on their phone. If their phone isn’t ringing, they are talking to whoever is sitting next to them, again loudly. To us sensible and polite Brits this is complete and utter rudeness. To Indian people this everyday life. Nobody is offended. In fact, nobody cares!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Extreme wealth to poverty
A lot of people said that we had not seen ‘real India’ because we were in a relatively wealthy part of the country. However, as with every place, there are rich people and there are poor people. It was quite shocking at times to see some of the poorer people, particularly the young girls begging near tourist attractions. At times it seemed like the Indian people are quite oblivious to the poverty in their area. However, I imagine that other parts of India see much worse poverty and we would have to travel further afield to see genuine poverty. When we landed in Mumbai on the way home, we thought we had seen poverty when we saw the slum which was right beside the perimeter fence. Then you see that almost every house has a satellite dish!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Loss of control
Talking amongst ourselves, we have all said that our biggest struggle is not having any control over time, food and schedule. All of us are independent people with full time jobs, mortgages and in some cases family. While we have really enjoyed this trip, it has been hard to answer to other people all of the time. They dictate our activities, they tell us when to take rest, when to each, how much to eat, what activities we will do. The downside of this is that I can’t seem to make my own decisions anymore. On the last day we had a menu put in front of us and I asked Devdas to order my food. I even accidently locked myself in my room and didn’t think I could make it out without help. Not sure how I’m going to cope living alone again!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Personal circumstances
Explaining our personal circumstances in India has been difficult. None of us, from the four team members, to the team leader, have a traditional set up with a husband and children. All of us are aged over 26 so to the Indians, this is strange. Ideally, we would all be married and have a child, or at least be planning a family. On more than one occasion people have tried to find me a husband, from their son to their cousin to their nephew who lives in London. They also can’t understand that I live alone. Ideally, I should live with my parents (who are divorced), my unmarried brother and also my married brother and his wife and two children. We would need a very big house! One of my hosts actually told me that under no circumstances would he ever ever let his unmarried daughter live alone, let alone 30 miles from the family home. I have to accept his opinion. Maybe one day he can come to the UK and see that I can manage fine alone, working full time, managing a house, bills and life alone.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Maids and help in the home
Many of families I lived with had a full time live in maid or at least one or two staff who visited daily to clean for them. One woman was amazed to learn that my brother and his wife both work full time, have two children and no maid! ‘How do they cope?’ ‘How do they look after their children?’ ‘How do they find the time to cook and clean?’ I was actually quite shocked by this. At home, couples know what they are taking on when they have a family. They know it will be expensive and they know they have to work. They are grateful for support from their extended family. We couldn’t contemplate having staff, not least because we couldn’t afford it! In India, they can’t imagine life without staff. Yes, the women here work hard looking after their family and preparing meals from scratch. But I challenge them to work full time and then come home to cook and clean and pay bills (And that isn’t even taking into account looking after the children!).

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Treatment of women
One thing which I found quite hard to witness was the treatment of some women. In India, it is completely normal for wives to run around after their husbands, eat their meals after the rest of the family, and serve food to everybody, even if they are quite capable of helping themselves. In the factories, many en supervised groups of women who were doing hard annual labour. One person actually told us that women were not capable of being supervisors! At home, women are taught to be quite independent, and more and more men now help around the home too, cooking, cleaning, parental responsibilities. Both systems have their pros and cons I’m sure, but I personally prefer ours!

Overall, we have been very lucky to have been chosen to be part of this GSE team. People would give anything to have the opportunity and see the things that we have seen. Devdas said that we have seen more in one month than he has seen in his lifetime. It is an experience we will remember forever.

Devdas, Rekah, Ramkrishna and Nagaraj all waved us away from Managlore airport and both me and Nicola later admitted that we were crying. Nicola because she would miss her hosts Devdas and Rekah and me because I really want to stay. Devdas did say that he would turn a blind eye if I didn’t want to get on the plane. He also said I was more than welcome to stay at his house but I’m sure he would live to regret that!

You can probably tell from the tone of the final blog that I really don’t want to leave. Although I have missed everybody at home, I could easily stay another month or two. Although, I’d like to maybe use some of my vocational skills out here and work with organisations to help them deliver their communications or Corporate Social Responsibility projects. The GSE trip has been a great experience but it’s time to start doing some work before I forget how to!

Rajendra and Janhavi have already phoned me and Nicola to ask us to come back to Belur or to visit their apartment in Bangalore, a place we haven’t been. Other fiends we have made have also asked us to comeback and it’s clear that they are 100%!g(MISSING)enuine and can’t wait to see us all again. The nice thing is that all four of us have had a very individual experience because we lived with different families. We will never run out of things to talk about and we will all stay in touch too. So if I’m not e-mailing or texting the girls, I will be e-mailing, whatsapping or hopefully visiting my friends in India.

Although I was nervous before I came, for many different reasons, I can say that I have had the best time ever and I am so grateful for this experience. If we had visited Karnataka and stayed in hotels it would have been a nice holiday but living with Rotarians and their families has made this experience extra special for every one of us. Yes, it was challenging but it has been worth it, both personally and professionally.

You can expect to see me in India again very very soon! (Maybe not in the monsoon!)

V noci som sa na komarov zobudil len raz,dalsi raz som sa zobudil na zimu a asi 3x na bordel co tu robili indovia. Totalne nahlas sa medzi sebou rozpravali,uplne kricali. Okolo 4/00 zacali chodit na hajzel,ocul som len same grcanie alebo co to bolo za zvuky. Nabuduce si radsej priplatim a ziadne byvanie s indami.

Z postele som vypadol okolo 8/00,zastavil sa na plackove ranajky a siel cca 3,5km po ceste k juznym chramom. Da sa tu pozicat aj motorka resp.vo velkom tu turisti chodia na bicykloch ale to ma nelakalo. Vsetko je to fajn dostupne pesi,teda ak to clovek nechce obehnut za jeden den.

Chramy v podstate to iste co vcera,zrucaniny,prach,skaly a jeden plateny areal. Ten som opat nenavstivil,i ked tu uz bolo vidiet indicke jednanie,straznik ma chcel pustit dnu za 100rupii,inak listok 250 a pre miestnych za 10rupii. Chramov mi uz v indii stacilo.

Pri jednom ma chytila sracka,tak som sa skoval za skalu a spravil to ako rodeny ind.

Uz si ani nelamem hlavu s odpadom,proste hodim bordel na zem a idem dalej.

V jednom chrame bolo podzemne mesto,spristupnena bola iba jedna mini chodba,ostatne zavalene,skoda.

Cestou nazad som sa osviezil kokosom,tento stal len 15rup,no nist musim opat zacat zjednavat aj o jedlo.

Kukol som este chram s velkou sochou slona,pri ktorom sa vsetci fotili a siel sa skovat pred peklom co bolo vonku do ubytka.

Cestou od slonieho chramu ma prenasledoval indicky soplak (asi 8.rokov) a chcel mi predat pohladnice.Jasne som mu hovoril,ze nemam zaujem,furt otravoval,isol se mnu zhruba 300m a potom to konecne vzdal. Takychto detskych predavacov je tu kopa.

V ubytku som sa odvazil dat sprchu,zbalil sa a pospal si.

Potom som od domacej zistil co stoji vlastne ananas. Velky som kupil za 50 rupii,v skutocnosti stoji 30rupii,este musim zistit pokolko su mandarinky.

Po prieskume vychodu a juhu mi ostaval uz len sever a zapad hampi. Na sever som sa nechystal,treba sa tam preplavit lodkou a su tam len ubytka a restiky. Ubytka su tam vraj lacnejsie a lepsie,len sa tam treba dostat cez rieku lodkou a ta po istom case je strasne draha,tusim po 18/00 za prevoz chcu 150 rupi ,inak 10 rupii.

Tak som siel na zapad,tam tiez nic neni iba fajn vyhlad na rieku. Na ceste kopa predavacov suvenirov a bananov. Zbadal som sipku k mango tree restike. Niekde som o nej cital,len som si nevedel spomenut ci v dobrom abo zlom,tak som to siel preskumat. Presiel som bananovnikovym sadmi a dostal sa do ciela. Sok,milion turistov,noreku uz nevadi,zapadnem sem,uz som bol i tak hladny. Vyzul som sa a sadol si na zem k stolu. Fajnovy vyhlad bol odtialto na rieku. Kukol som menu,riadne palky za jedlo,dosol ku mne casnik a povedal mi nech sa presunem k druhemu stolu,bo sem idu cedok turisty,ok,presunul som sa.Potom zas dosol,ze nech sa presunem k dalsiemu,ze ma dalsiu velkugrupu. To som sa uz nasral a isol prec odtial. Fakt tuto restiku neodporucam,je to tu drahe,milion ludi, nahovno jedlo (to som zistili neskor od jednej baby) a drbnuta obsluha.

Cestou nazad som si odychol pri pristave (no ani nie pristav len male clnky tu parkuju a prepravuju ludi na druhu stranu). Indovia susili veci na zemi ale to ma az tak nezaujalo.Zaujal ma jeden biely par co sa snazil dostat cez rieku. Chceli ju prebrodit,zrejme nechceli dat zarobit vydieracskym prepravcom na clnkoch. Snazili sa ,snazili ale nedarilo sa im to,isli cez dost hlboku vodu a silny prud. Indovia sa na nich riadne zabavali az sa jeden zlutoval a nasmeroval ich na relativnu plytcinu. Nakonec to dokazali.

Vcera ako som bol na zapade slnka,som tam spozoroval jedneho chalana s velkym batohom,mal na nom rozne vlajocky krajin co navstivil. Videl som tam cesku a chorvatsku zastavu. Tak reku konecne s volakym pokecam. Pytam sa ci je cech abo chorvat a ukazujem mu na vlajocky. Hned na mna spatno kukol,som srb,to nie je chorvatsko.A potom uz len podrazdenym tonom odpovedal na mojich par otazok. Debil nacionalisticky,clovek sa ho normalne opyta ked vidi na batohu vlajocky ,logicky mi to vychadzalo na to,ze je bud odtial abo odtial. No nist teda.

Zatial som fakt nestretol ziadnych normalnych turistov,som zvedavy co ma caka v Goa.

Musim si kupit tu ziletku,uz ma to zacina svrbet.

Suveniry nakupim az Dili,sa mi to nechce nosit v batohu.

Konecne som spojazdil zastrcku na izbe,zas bolo treba zapnut specialny vypinac mimo izbu.

Na vecer som bol kuknut zapad slnka,dnes bol lepsi. Ako som siel na kopec a mal som v rukach banany,jeden mi spadol na zem.To chcela vyuzit jedna opica a uchmatnut mi ho,no bol som rychlejsi,ale ta spina potom do mna skocila,vycerila zuby a stiahla sa nazad,bo uz zbadala dalsich ludi s bananmi,ti ich im davali.

Zajtra v plane odchod do Hospitu okolo 9/00,tam kuknutie mesta,zabezpecenie busu do goa.hadam ten statny pojde. Tu predavaju normalne sukromne ale vsetko len sleeperi,to veru nechcem.

Na ubytku som planoval turecko,asi dam len volaku trasu podla LP a nebudem spekulovat. Kukal som letenky tie su dost lacne domov,resp vijdu tolko co vlak/bus. Este rozmyslam ak zuzana nedojde za mnu do istanbulu,ze by som letel do sarajeva a odtial siel domov. Ale to zalezi od toho ci tam bude futbal.

V noci som nemohl opat spat,uz sa tesim na zajtrajsi 24 hodinovy presun.

Po zobudeni a neumyti sa. Sak som v Indii netreba. Som siel na miestny mini trh na rananky. Dal som si placky s omackou,stretol som tu aj mojich susedov ale len zeny,tie ang nevedeli.

Z ranajok som sa musel vratit na ubytko vymenit si obuv. Slapky ma moc oskierali tak som nahodil botasky. Zla kupa teda,toto su skor len take plazove slapky,v goa asi kupim neake lepsie.

Tak a mohla zacat moja put po chramoch za pekneho slnecneho pocasia. Prvy sa na radu dostal blizky chram Virupaksha,vstupne bolo 2rup,za fotak chceli 50 rup. Pred vstupom do tohto dost velkeho komplexu sa bolo treba vyzut. Botasky som si odlozil tam kde vsetci,na zem k stene. Pytam sa chalpika ci to je gratis,vraj hej,len dobrovolny poplatok ak niekot chce. Chram ma moc neoslnil. Predomnou bola daka skolska vypprava tak ma dost brzdili najskor ale nakonec som sa ich striasol. V jednej miestnosti ma chceli oznackovat cervenou bodkou na celo,to som odmietol a pratal sa radsej inde. Dostal som sa k dakej vodnej nadrzi,tam zistene,ze sa da dostat do tohto chramu aj zdarma ale zas 2 rupie su neni moc. Spravil som par mobilovych fotiek,zrejme si ma straznik vsimol,chcel aby som zaplatil poplatok za fotak.Tak som mu ukaz batoh,ze nech si prekutre,ze ja fotak nemam. To odmietol a pustil ma von. Obul som si botasky,dosol vyberac,ze mam zaplatit za strazenie topanok,hovorim,ze to je dobrovolne,ukazuje mi tabulu a tam je fakt napisane,uskladnenie za poplatok. Platili vsetci aj domaci tak som zaplatil nech neotravuje. Indovia su vacsi ojebavaci nez vietnamci,musim si na nich davat vacsi pozor.

Odtialto som siel omrknut hned kopec co je po lavej strane tohto chramu. Na nom je kopa zrucanin a fajnovy vyhlad na okolie.Zrucaniny mi pripominaly grecke stavby.

Jeden kopec mi nestacil tak som vyliezol na Matanga hill. Vystup nebol narocny,z vrcholu bol este lepsi vyhlad nez z toho prveho kopca. Zliezol som dole,ocitol som sa v Achutaray chrame,trocha som ho preskumal a vybral sa k hlavnemu dnesnemu bodu vithalla templu. Slnko uz fakt pripekalo,nebolo sa sa kde skovat,sama vyprahnuta krajina. Cestou kopa dalsich fajnovych chramov.

Vithalla chram bol spoplatneny,domaci za 10 rup ,cudzinci za 250rup,tak som sa na nich vysral,nebudem platit niekolkonasobne vyssie vstupne ako domaci. Este mi pokladnik ukazoval rozne obrazky z chramu,ze nech tam len idem,ze to je fajnove. No kedze som neni velky nadsenec umenia vyprdol som sa mu na to. Stacia mi chrami co su po okoli a tych je tu fakt kopa a su zdarma.

Tu som si kupil nanuk,bo som uz fakt skapinal od tepla. Zjednane z 25rup na 20rup,po zjedeny a prestudovany obalu stoji normalne 15 rup. No nist teda.

Nazad do ubytka som si dal kokos,kukol ako sa ludia vozia na kruhovych lodkach na druhy breh,dokupil banany a siel si pospat na ubytko. Fakt ma to chodenie po mega slnku a mega teplu vycerpalo

Zistene,ze v Cochin ma dobre natiahli pri kupe bananov,za 3 som platil 15 rup, tu za 5 len 10 rup.

Spravil som mierny prieskum netu,1 hodina za 40 rupii,to je fakt palka. Je tu kopa indickych turistov a samozrejme nesmiu chybat aj daky sikmooky a vsade pritomny rusi. Osadenstvo vacsinou hipisaci,nezavislaci a rozne ine individua co sa hraju na indov.

Po dvojhodinovom spanku,ktory by trval isto dlhsie,len ma moji susedia zobudili,bo odchadzali do dalsieho mesta,som sa s nimi rozlucil. Chalan povedal,ze sa isto este stretneme a ked nie my,tak nasi potomkovia urcite 😊 Dal mi svoje tel.cislo,ja som mu dal moj email ale to nevedel co je,mu to vysvetloval dalsi jeho clen rodiny. Fajn rodinka,prve pozitivum z indie.Ak teda este nepocitam toho inda z busu.

Neskor som sa vydal na sunset point kuknut zapad slnka. Uz tu bola kopa ludi a opice. Zapad nic moc,najlepsi bol v laose na don det.

Potom uz len dopisovanie dennika,ucenie sa ang a spanok.

Early morning over the rice paddies.
There's nothing intimate about Indian cities. Surely it's here that that well worn cliche ""assault on the senses"" was spawned. Urban India is where the concept of a billion people in one nation resonates.

The gamy odours of raw filth that overlay the spicy aromas of street cuisine. The incessant rhythmic honking of car horns. Mosque wake up calls (there may only be a 10% Muslim population here but that's still 100 million). Mainlining vegetarian curries. Cows knee deep in street rubbish somehow eking out an alternate food source to grass. It's dank, it's full throttle and maybe it's not the Indian romance of imaginations or from the pages of Rudyard Kipling, but the lurching excitement of Mysore, Bangalore and Hyderabad has left a thousand still-life images entrenched in the memory banks.

No more so than the mayhem of their markets. The atmosphere is pure earth but the colours, noise and smells are brutally left field from Woolworths, Carrefour or Walmart. (Ok, maybe not Walmart).

Far from there being a stampede of tourists, ourselves and the few westerners we stumbled across in these markets would stroll around bug-eyed and rattle off a few frames while the locals gawk
Mysore market
back and wonder what this tourist fuss is all about. We wallow in the good, the bad and the ugly of this otherworldly environment but from a native perspective this is simply their day in day out rota and a struggle to disinfect themselves from a breadline existence. The implication of some of their looks was;

""You find this so interesting, how about we swap"".

You don't need to do too much soul searching to understand their frustration at the inequities. The roles we had fallen into we're primarily an accident of birth.

The most ambitious guy was the bloke with the table full of second hand dentures. I didn't know who to feel most sorry for;

- the vendor himself trying to find customers in the narrow market of used teeth.

- the people who had been forced to sell him their choppers, or

- those who might be actually tempted to purchase a set of fangs that had already spent a deal of time inside someone else's mouth. I assume this group would also need to try quite a few sets before finally settling on the ones with juuuuust the right fit.
The Guru's guru! Hampi Bazaar.


The mind boggles.

As character building as those cities were, only a martyr would visit all three consecutively without trying to shoehorn some recovery time in the midst.

Hampi, tucked into the middle of Karnataka, has been long esconsed on the hippy tourist trail in India and looked a worthy stop for a few days. We should have made it longer.

Verdant rice paddies are lined by a landscape of hanging boulders that balance like a set of fiddle sticks that cling on through sheer self belief. A creek meanders amongst and the entire region is peppered with Hindu places of worship.

The backpacker demographic holds court here, as if a force field exists to keep large hotel chains and anything else remotely upmarket at arms length from this world heritage area.

Naturally, with such a majority of shoestring clientele there's no shortage of westerners who have converted to overnight gurus. The guy with the stick-on dreadlock business must be doing pretty well for himself in Hampi.

With time on your hands, days could easily turn into weeks in this little oasis about as far removed from the Indian maelstrom as can be
Mysore market
The live version in cages could see these guys 2 metres away.
imagined.


Monkeys - I'm not a fan.


Anybody out there with an aversion to gutter rhetoric, please tune out now. As for the rest of you ......

It was one of those lower depth days when you search for some self justification for this travelling gig. Caught off guard, India launched a jack-in-the-box attack and went for the jugular.

It's only 150 klms from Wayanad to Mysore but 3 tuk tuks, 2 buses, 5 hours and 20 lineal klms down, the 130 to go may as well have been to the moon given our chances of getting there.

That ubiquitous say it all yet say nothing Indian head wobble had lost all its exotic gloss in the hours of mis-communication;

""Bus coming sir. Bus not coming sir. Bus being late sir. Bus being full sir. Please go to other bus station sir"".

The prospect of ""bus not bloody existing sir"" weighed heavily.

Penny wandered off to the public ladies for a touch of aromatic ""eau de India"" whilst I sat on a crumpled iron bench at the bus stop of this dusty frontier town and no escape plan. I needed a
Maharaja Palace Mysore
sign.

Right on cue, up sauntered a monkey. Totally at ease with his position in the primate pecking order, he sat down 3 metres in front, stared directly into my eyes with a look of teenage disdain and began masturbating, as if he recognised a human hangdog expression and was up for rubbing some salt into wounds.This wasn't the message from above I had anticipated.

I wasn't sure whether to;

(a) Walk over and spoil the guy's romance by swinging my number 11 foot in his general direction, or

(b) Go and buy him a cigarette to help him enjoy his moment of post self-gratification.

Either way, it's now official. I don't like monkeys.

India, you won that round.

The white collar hippie



What is it with India that turns the most conservative, short back and sides, neat as a pin, designer clothes wearing westerner to turn hippie within a matter of days of arriving?

After leaving Kerala we travelled to Mysore, Bangalore, Hampi and finally to Hyderabad to conclude our Indian experience ( this time... does that mean we might be back)?

I
Bangalore Market
really have enjoyed India this time round despite us both getting sick here on our last few days. I think we jinxed ourselves as I had only just finished bragging to a German couple that; ""we had not been sick all year"". But having fallen ill, Hampi was probably a good place to just watch the world go by for a few days and let the bug do its thing.

So I sat in my hammock, trying not to let it swing in case it made me nauseous and watched and pondered on the new breed of white collar hippies we had encountered along the way to actually see the final transformation in Hampi.

First they arrive sporting their corporate hair cuts, neatly shaven, wearing their designer label clothing and looking every bit the tourist. Within a few days a dreadlock is woven into the short strands of hair, their designer clothes are gradually being swapped for haram pants, Indian shirts and the odd headband. By this stage they have a healthy collection of string wristbands and anklets, and occasionally sporting a red dot in the middle of their forehead. Not long after this, the shoes disappear and
Hampi school kids
they can handle the rugged dirty garbage ridden streets and lane-ways barefoot. All that is required now is some body piercing to complete the picture.

By the time they reach Hampi, many more dreadlocks have been added, no doubt from the trade-in of their western sandals. They look thinner and more gaunt, ahh but they haven't been sick they claim, they have thrown away knives and forks, they can eat with there hands and eat rice and curry once a day and survive on bananas every other meal.

Hampi is an interesting town, a place that has a great history, UNESCO sites, the most beautiful rice paddies amongst elephant size boulders. A small stream dividing the very hippie from the up and coming hippie town. The temple elephant comes to the stream each day to be washed by the tourists and to bless them for their efforts. At sunset you can climb any number of boulders to a temple and sit overlooking the town below. This is where the white collar hippies turn pro. In this tranquil setting, ( apart from 50+ westerners) young kids come selling chai, the ""seasoned hippies"" offer tattoo services, and the white colllar
Anengundi. Sleeping baby in a sling.
hippies compare notes on their resent additions, be it makeup, more dreads etc etc.

So where to from here? How long after leaving India, do the dreadlocks get cut off, their feet get scrubbed and the Indian clothes get tossed? I guess I'll check it out at the airport tomorrow.

Hong Kong here we come.

Do Bangalore sme dorazili o 7/00,takze po 14-hodinach jazdy.

Hned po vystupeni sa na mna vrhli riksaci,ktorych som odignoroval. Pobral som sa pesibusom na dalsiu bus stanicu vzdialenu cca 5km odkial chodia busy do Hospetu. Bus stanica sa nachadza pri zel.stanici.

Cestou som zle odbocil a ocitol sa v botanickej zahrade. Dost ludi tu cvicilo a behalo. Moc som tu nepobudol,bo mi bola strasna zima. Som si musel dat na seba aj tricko s dlhym rukavom.

Po tom ako mi naskocila navigacia som sa uz v pohode dostal na bus stanicu.

Toto mesto mi ukazalo uz pravu tvar Indie. Vsade po ceste kravy,tony odpadkov a milion ludi a samozrejme drbkovci co furt trubili. Cochin bol oproti tomuto prechadzka ruzovou zahradou.

Jedlo som odkladal na neskor,co bola chyba,bo po dorazeni na bus stanicu akurat moj spoj vyrazal. Uplne stara kraksna bez klimy,sedacky (lavice) robene pre trpaslikov,ledvaj som sa tam napratal. Cesta do hsopetu trvala cca 9.hodin. Komplet cestu z bangalore do Hospetu som absolvoval iba ja. Vacsina ludi sa presuval len medzi dedinkami max.2 zastavky.

Krajina vokol bola uplne vyprahnuta,same kozy a neskutocny bordel.

Kusok pred cielom si ku mne sadol mlady ind,furt volaco mlel ale moc som ho nevnimal,bol som uplne k.o. Na jednej obcerstvovacej zastavke mi dal okostovat tu ich mini kavu,fajn. V buse mi do notesa pisal rozne jedla co mam okostovat.

Po dorazeny do Hospetu zas otravny nadhanaci,ponukali mi riksu a ubytku v hampi,vsetko mega predrazene.

Na bus stanici som zisitl kolko stoji statny bus do Goa ,450 rupii a vyraza o 20/00,listok sa neda kupit dopredu. Hadam ho teda zozenem v den odchodu.

Po obhliadke mesta z busu som sa rozhodol,ze v Hospete (totalna diera,neskor zistene,ze takto vyzeraju skoro vsetky mesta v indii) nezostanem ale idem priamo do turistickeho Hampi.

Na bus stanici som nastupil na statny bus a uz sa viezol do Hampi. Konkudor mi nemal vidat 3 rupie,tak mi na listok napisal 3 a mam si ich vypytat ked budem vystupovat.

Cestou bolo vidiet kopa starych chramov,fakt parada.

Po pol hodine sme dorazili do Hampi,od konkudora som si vypytal 3 rupie,ten mi ich s nevolou dal.

Opat nadhanaci,takyto otravny veru neboli v ziadnej krajine.Tak som s jednym isol nech ma radost,aspon ma doviedol do dediny vzdialenej asi 5 minut chodze od bus stanice.

Priviedol ma k jednej tetke ,izba s fanom,normal zachodom za 400 rup,zjednavat nechcela,vraj niektory tu zostavaju aj mesiac a nezjednavaju tak preco by mala dat mne lepsiu cenu ked tu chcem ostat len par noci. Tak nist teda,hned sa na mna vrhli dasli ludia co tu ponukaju ubytka (cela dedina je len o ubohych ubytkach) ale nikto nechcel dat lepsiu cenu. Potom ma zas volaky clovek odtiahol a ponukol za 285 rupi,po zlave. Prave indicke ubytko ale dako som to zvladol, nech mam na co aspon spominat. Mal som jednopostel s fanom,share wc a sprcha (len hadica,humus). Izba bola trochu vlhka,zlaty Central GH v BKK ,a samozrejme nesmeli chybat moji priatelia,komari.Vedla mna byvala indicka rodina.

Embarking.
Well, it’s nearly the end of our fantastic journey around Karnataka. I think I can safely say for most of us that there’s still so much more to see here, we’d like to stay a little longer; some would stay a lot longer.

Yesterday we arrived in Kundapur, and are staying a hotel called Blue waters. The hotel is fantastic, very clean, and very beautiful. After we were checked in and shown around we were given a couple of hours to settle in and use the pool etc, needless to say we jumped on the wifi!

A little later, myself and Emily decided to go for a walk along the river and found a small boat yard where some men were making boats by stitching them together, sounds strange, and I couldn’t tell what they used to cover any holes but it was pretty impressive. We saw some of the boats on the river later and they were rather good.

Around 4:30pm we were taken on a boat to a small island in the river. We all had a little giggle that the boat man had to bail a bit of water out when we disembarked. I know
stitched boat.
there’s been lots of good food here but I didn’t realise we’d put that much weight on! On the other side of the island we could see where the river meets the ocean, and there was lots of little water wildlife to keep me happy, from birds to miniature crabs and flip flop trees!

As the boat left the island for the hotel docking point, we were happily gliding along the river, like a gondola, all sat with our life jackets on, and me, Tracy and Emily wondered how the fishermen reached their boats moored halfway out into the river...then we spotted a man walking near a boat and realise the water didn’t even reach his waist. Felt a bit daft sat there with our life jackets on but better safe than sorry!

In the evening we ate by the pool with Abhi, the hotel owner, and his wife and 2 children. We were served lots of tasty food and they were such good company even though the little one had a cold.

Today Abhi took us to see his Floriculture farm, they grow Orchids, Antheriums, Heliconia, Rubber trees, Areca nuts and have a few lodges in
Miniature crabs
the forest called Green woods, which would be brilliant for people who love nature, drawing, photography etc... They have made the lodges very rustic and have kept the landscape as natural as possible. The orchids were gorgeous and they gave us each a stem to take, shame it won’t make it home. The rubber trees were quite young and not ready to harvest for another 3 years. There were 2 men painting each tree with lime, this apparently helps keep the tree free of some diseases. I think we know the Heliconia called the bird of paradise plant mostly, but I didn’t realise there are actually over 100 varieties! A lot of their flowers are used in displays in hotels, but mainly they are sent to Goa, as they are in big demand there for festivals, weddings, gifts, offerings, etc.

When we left the Green woods, we visited a Nagar temple, which is a temple that is for the serpent. They feed about 4000 people every month at a festival held there. We learnt that people with skin problems come to the temple and roll on the floor around the idol and believe this will help to cure them.
orchids in mist spray.
Must be something connected to the shedding of the snake skin (good theory Emily!)

Back to hotel for lunch and then some of us may hide from the hottest part of the day. We have our final presentation tonight which is the marker for the end of our experience really. As much as I’m looking forward to boring everyone at home with all my stories about the things I have done, the places I’ve seen(I have a LOT of photos!), the amazing food that I’ve eaten, and the most welcoming, fantastic people I’ve met with every host I’ve been lucky to have, and the people who have taken us everywhere and looked after us every day, I would love to stay longer, but I’ll just have to start saving now so I can come back!

Lorry overloaded with water tanks
(thankfully empty!!!)
I couldn't be in India for a month and not write a big about the Indian road network!!! The best way to summarise is “expect the unexpected” and we've certainly seen our share of that during the past 4 weeks. From overloaded lorries to scooters with family of four on board we really have seen everything India has to offer. We've seen buses so overloaded with people standing in the aisle it's leaning heavily to one side, rickshaws with fridges hanging out of the back, scooters with water barrels on and many many more crazy sights!

2 wheelers are much more prevalent here in India and provide many people with affordable transport between towns and villages. Scooters are very popular for women to drive and motorbikes are parked outside most houses. Rickshaws are very common sight across the whole of India, operating as taxis, light goods vehicles and school transport.

Motorways under construction can take years to finish due to disputes over land ownership, which results in many ""diversions"" from the main highway on most routes between towns. A lot of people ignore these signs and stick to the unfinished part of the road anyway and then some people
traditional bullock cart
just drive down the wrong side of the main highway because the route is shorter! Our bus driver Nagaraj has looked after us tremendously well and doesn't take any chances when trying to overtake. He is always paying attention to the road ahead and despite the constant tooting from other drivers, refuses to overtake until the road is completely clear.

Millet thrashing on the main road is another strange practice we have observed on rural roads, where farmers put out in large piles and as the cars drive over the seeds are removed from their shells and the farmers collect these after a few hours. This practice is not recommended by the Government as it can cause damage to vehicles and pollute the crops with diesel.

Lorries here in India are very interesting and painted with very bright colours and interesting warning signs on the bumper! They carry everything from rocks to coffee and lots more! A lot of them are Ashok Leyland brand which have a UK subsidiary company called Optare which has recently shut down it's factory in Blackburn, Lancashire.

Here you will find a few photos collected on our travels and hope you enjoy!!!
Tractor with gigantic load of hay!!!

Harish showing us round the farming training centre at Mysore
Providing training to farmers is often referred to as “extension services” and is often done through the same measures such as workshops, seminars and on-farm demonstrations. This is often carried out in India with public funds directly through Government staff, where the project I currently manage

Many people have asked me if there is a need to educate farmers in the UK when we have much higher rate of literacy and general increased level of awareness. Both UK and India need to communicate ideas and new technologies to farmers and it’s not always easy .

After talking with many different agriculturalists here in India I have found many similarities, despite the very different climate and geography. In the UK our average farm size is approx. 50ha which is much larger than India’s 2ha. Even with these differences in scale, I have learnt the farmers are actually similar. I have visited many farms in Karnataka, growing tropical crops we cannot grow in the UK, but the challenges are the same. Farms need to adapt an integrated system to provide a diverse income stream to allow for crops failing, drought or low market prices. This is something Indian farms are much
Karnataka Milk Federation

better at. In the UK all our markets are private and prices change daily, but India certain crops are controlled by Marketing Boards where prices are set for the whole year.

I have learnt a lot about the workings of the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), both in Mangalore and Shimogga and made some very useful contacts who I will definitely keep in touch with. UK farmers are not terribly good at working in cooperation, but I strongly agree with Mhatma Ghandi’s vision “I firmly believe that we shall not derive the full benefits of agriculture until we take to cooperative farming”. Wise words indeed from 1947!!! Farmers can definitely create better market prices by working together, but it will take time.

On another vocational visit in Mangalore I visited the Karnataka State Government Department of Agriculture and I feel the policy structure here in India works much better than the UK. The subsidy programmes for farmers run for 12 months and uses information gained from the Taluks (villages), which feeds into the regional and state policy. This bottom-up process is much more effective and able to deliver positive results, unlike in the UK where our policy comes down
University of Agricultural Science (Bangalore)
from the top, firstly from the European Union and then national UK Government. This approach makes it hard for UK farmers to understand and accept messages and is one reason why the training and extension services provided through our project – Rural Skills Cumbria - is so important and why I enjoy my job.

In Mysore I visited another Karnakata State Government office, this time an Agricultural Training Centre and learnt how staff work very hard to promote courses to farms, using native language and many posters, so even illiterate people can learn. In the UK farmers are very busy people and leaving the farm for 2 or 3 days is very difficult. Karnataka State Government pays for accommodation, travel and expenses to help encourage attendance and perhaps we can learn from this in the UK.

My last vocational visit took place in Shimogga I visited the University of Agricultural Science, which I found really interesting and made some very useful contacts that I hope we can work on collaborative projects in the future. The meeting consisted of the Dean of Education, Head of Research, Extension Services, Organic Department and Soil Scientists. Some PhD and Masters students were also present and I asked them the question “Will you find agricultural jobs when you graduate?” None of the students plan to use their qualifications for rural jobs, but instead work in IT or Commerce. This was very disappointing for me and I think India and the UK need to encourage youth to stay in rural areas and provide job opportunities which benefit the whole community.

Our official Vocational visits are now over but we are constantly learning from the various Rotarians we meet. A lot of people in India come from agricultural families of some description and have a good knowledge of farming practices. The opportunity to meet so many people connected to my industry has been amazing and I am truly grateful to Rotary for this wonderful opportunity.

Bye for now!!! Emily

Well, Mangalore comference was definitely an experience, in many ways. We were told that over 3000people had registered at the conference when we arrived on friday! Yikes!
As soon as we got off the bus on friday, we were greeted by our old friend Devdas who has bern in touch with us throughout our trip. We arranged to meet at the conference hall that evening then went to unpack, what by now, are rather humongous suitcases!
It was great to see so many faces we recognised.(hello again to Dr.Hari A Shetty and family from Kushalnagar!) It was amazing how many people we recognised. After a lovely catch up and evening of cultural entertainment, we went back to the club for an early night and final preparations!
By saturday I was nervous about the presentation, lot of people watching, tv screens etc... while waiting to go on we were put on the big screen, just as Tracy was taking a nap!lol it rested my nerves so thanks Tracky!
Shouldnt have been worried. Presentation was good, quite enjoyed it. People clapped at my speech, which was lovely (thank you Rekha) I have been fascinated by the bond that families have here, and that they share such fantastic meals and I think we should bring this back in the UK!
After presentation we went for a deserved Lychee bacardi breezer and a bash on the karaoke!
Needless to say it was a late night Saturday and later morning Sunday. We made up for it with breakfast and brunch and an afternoon shopping!

Diane receiving rose at Rotary School funded by Shimogga East Club
Shimoga proved interesting, especially Wednesday, when we visited seven different places. The morning began with an elephant ride. Our hosts had heard that we hadn't been able to ride an elephant at the Dubare Camp, so kindly added an extra trip to make up for it. Elephants seem very tall from the ground, but once you climb the ladder and are placed on the howdah, it doesn't seem so bad and the animals move so gently, it's almost as if they want to look after you and give you a comfortable ride.

The summer palace was another interesting place to visit, with beautiful carved stone pieces, brought from many places,which were really attractive works of art. Then there was the tiger and lion safari. Again, we had failed to see tigers earlier on our tour, so it was a plus to be able to photograph some now.



Maybe, though, the best parts of the day were visiting four examples of the kind of projects Rotary clubs in Karnataka have been involved in. First there was a low cost housing initiative, where we saw four houses built with Rotary funding, in order to give rural workers a better
Affordable housing project funded by Rotary
home to live in. We worked out that each one had cost the equivalent of £750 to build. The owners were keen to show us around and to follow us round the village and be photographed with us. It was interesting to see a rural set up.



The next project was a blood bank, which was a new thing for me to see. I learnt a lot there, and now feel much more aware of how blood banks operate. Then there was a Rotary funded school, where we were asked to address a hall full of students, neither for the first nor the last time during our trip. Nicola was cursing me for dropping her into speaking off the cuff to the audience, but I was confident that she could do it well, and she did! Tracy was the one who was speaking when the awkward question came up about how sex education was imparted in Britain. In her usual form, she handled it perfectly. It's a very good team we have here for being able to speak to any audience on any subject which is thrown at them.



The fourth project was a residential school for the severest of mentally challenged people. Apparently these children are so difficult for poor rural parents to handle, that they tie them up all day, while they go to work. The state they are in when the parents return at the end of the day is appalling. The school manages to seek these children out and educate them in the most basic of things, such as cleanliness and toileting. It was a sobering visit for us all, but very good to see how much local Rotary clubs are managing to achieve.



After Shimogga we returned to Mangalore through beautiful countryside. This was the weekend of the District Conference, which had some interesting highlights. K. R. Ravindran from Sri Lanka proved a moving speaker, as he spoke about the importance of having passion in what we do. He talked of pity killing with kindness, whereas passion gives action and hope to people. He also said, quite rightly, that each Rotary district must look at the sort of things that they can focus on and concentrate on that. This has been made very clear to me, as we have travelled around Karnataka. Indian clubs need to focus on very different things to our clubs in Britain. Finally he talked of a sustainable initiative by Danone, the French milk products company. Apparently they have set up a very successful social, philanthropic business in Bangladesh, which now employs 1,600 people. I need to look further at this.



In the evening there was a choice of karaoke or a presentation of a wide variety of Indian classical dancing. I'll leave our readers to guess who chose which activity, but suffice it to say that we all enjoyed ourselves very much.



It is now time to move on to our final leg of the exchange, which has so far been so eventful.

Witch doctors
Monday 28 – Tuesday 29 January 2013

I’m falling behind with the blog as we are so busy! Other team members have updated our activities from the last few days so I will try to keep this brief.....

We have spent Monday and Tuesday in Karkala where the Rotarians were delighted to meet us all. They had a packed itinerary for us including visiting a church, an artisan centre where we saw some fantastic carving from the students and a museum of old artefacts from the area. My favourite part of the day was the visit to the Rotary hospital where Dr. Asha Hedge works. Although Di has visited a lot of hospitals here, this was my first and it was really interesting to visit a place which specialises in care for women and children. The hospital looked very clean and tidy. I had commented that I had not seen any pregnant women in India, and I got my chance here. Women in India seem to hide their pregnancy well with their sari so it’s hard to tell if somebody is pregnant.

There were many babies in the hospital, sharing a bed with the mother to help them
Team bonding
bond. We also heard a couple of very sad stories of the patients. I was also interested to learn that expectant parents are not allowed to find out the sex of their baby here. This is quite a new system in India and was introduced by the Government to protect female babies, less desired in India as they cost families more through marriage.

Our trip to Karkala also took us to a beautiful waterfall for a picnic, a Jain temple at the top of 200 steps and a traditional festival where communities meet and can have their social problems solved by village witch doctors. It was explained to us that people who have an unfaithful husband or a husband who drinks too much could bring their problems here to have them solved. We did a lot of people watching at the festival and we didn’t see any two ladies with the same sari. The variety and colours of the women’s outfits are amazing!

On our second evening we attended a meeting and a house warming. It was like no house warming you have seen before, with hundreds of people coming along to see the house, share dinner in
House warming
a outside canteen and watch the various blessings take place.

In Karkala, I stayed with two different hosts. Ananthakrishna and his wife Raja had a beautiful home, built by their son in 2005. They were very proud of their house, car and four granddaughters. They had to leave to attend a wedding in Banaglore so I spent my second night bunked up with Nicola. Thank you to Dr.Asha and her husband Prakash for taking me in unexpectedly! And for feeding me up on dosas and fruit!

District conference presentation
As other team members have already mentioned, we had a big audience for our presentation at the District Conference in Mangalore last weekend. Thanks go to Val and Terry Leivers from Nottingham for the picture of us up on stage not looking at all nervous. We have done so many formal and informal (unexpected) presentations now that nothing seems to faze us!

After the long build-up to our conference presentation, it was great to spend an evening winding down, even if it did mean I had to sing in the karaoke bar, which you would never see me doing at home!

We knew we would have the opportunity at the conference to catch up with many of the Rotarians we have spent time with throughout our trip but this time we were saying goodbye for much longer. Having bid so many farewells, it felt quite strange to hop on our bus again and set off to our final two host families. However, we were warmly welcomed in Karkala and immediately started another programme of visits.

Our first visit was to the Rotary hospital, whose main services are for women and children. There is also an ophthalmology department. The
Karkala - bhootha kola festival
hospital teaches students and is associated with a medical college under Manipal University.

We then visited a Catholic church where preparations were being made for the annual Attur Shrine Festival. Thousands of people travel far and wide on a holy pilgrimage. Non-believers and people of other religions also attend.

Also on our programme for the first day in Karkala was a visit to a theme park. We thought this was a bit strange until we were told that it was actually a museum! The Kotti Chennaya Theme Park depicts the lives of two heroes (Koti and Chennaya) through several pictures and there are 10-feet high statues of them. There are also many interesting features of the local culture displayed.

In the afternoon, we saw the skilled work of students at an artisan training centre that is sponsored by Canara Bank. Great talent was evident in their stone and wood carvings, metal work, and terracotta items. Had we not already been struggling with the restrictions on our luggage allowance, I think a few of us may have been tempted to buy a few items!

After a little rest, we were taken to a spiritual festival known as
Karkala - Hanumangundi Falls Kudremukh National Park
bootha kola. We saw the ritual dancers preparing to impersonate a spirit. When viewed in full costume and make-up and seeing them run towards you bearing swords, it is a little unnerving!

The following day, we thought we were going on a trek in the kundremukh national park. It turned out to be a relatively short, gentle, walk to the hanumangundi falls, though there were almost 400 steps involved. It was very peaceful and relaxing sitting in the sunshine at the base of the falls, chatting and eating papaya. We almost had to be dragged away from the scenic beauty of the falls and the national park.

As if one climb that day was not enough, we climbed another 200 steps up to a slightly smaller gommateshwara statue late in the afternoon. At 42 feet high, it is the second tallest in Karnataka (the tallest being the one we saw in Shravanbelagola).

An informal Rotary meeting followed and we delivered a short presentation about ourselves and our experiences so far. We were then whisked off to one of the Rotarian’s relative’s housewarming in Moodabidri. It was a bit like an open house where people were welcomed into the home and were able to wander round at their own pace. I am not sure that I could welcome complete strangers into my home! As is customary here, food is always offered. We therefore sat down to a wonderful selection of foods, eating off a banana leaf.

The hospitality everywhere we go is overwhelming and we are always sad to say goodbye to our hosts but we are looking forward to the next, and last, stop of the tour of Karnataka now, which we believe will be somewhat more relaxed (we’ll soon find out if this is the case!).

We will, we will ....rock you!
Saturday 26 – Sunday 27 January 2013

It’s fair to say that we have been ‘Indianised’. When we first arrived in Mangalore everything was a shock to us. The food, the traffic, the noise and the litter. Now, we are back in the city and everything just feels like home. We don’t notice the noise or the litter anymore, the traffic feels calmer and we can’t wait to eat the Mangalore food and see some of our old friends!

We are back in Mangalore for the district conference. Although we got to relax and meet friends at the venue on Friday night, today was time for serious work as we had to present our experiences to over 3000 people. First though, we were able to listen to the rest of the guests and keynote speakers. Our own presentation went well and we covered what Rotary does in the UK, what we learned on our vocational days as well as our own personal highlights from the trip.

Also at the conference were a couple from Nottingham. They are Rotarians who have spent 10 weeks per year in India for the last six years. They have worked on projects totalling
Banana bun
more than £500,000. It was really interesting to share our thoughts on India with them. And great to hear a British accent again! In the evening, after a long day, it was time for a cultural exchange, so while Angie went to watch some dancing, the rest of us showed the Indians some British Culture..........by singing on the karaoke and dancing to Gangnam Style!

Sunday was a chance to relax and perhaps overindulge. So we started the day with two breakfasts, just so that I had a chance to have my favourite food again, banana buns! After an afternoon of shopping for silks, wall hangings and other gifts, my Mangalore host Rupal picked me up to take me to a famous ice cream parlour called Bappas. The Chocolate Dad ice cream I had was fab! I also got a chance to see Dev and Rahul again and they both beat me at board games before we had a KFC. KFC is not like the KFC in the UK, it’s certainly Indianised!

Prakash, the bakery owner friend of Nicola's has invited Nicola and Emily for dinner and me, Rupal and Punit also go along. Prakash has what I would
Three wise men?
Devdas, Prakash and Punit
call a ‘party room’ in his home with a fantastic bar area which we can enjoy along with Prakash, his wife Keerthi and Devdas and his wife Rekha. We also had some fantastic Indian wine. I might be a convert! The other girls also wanted to try out KFC in India so I made my second trip of the day there. I think it’s time for a serious detox when I get home. The food here has been so amazing that I’m going to find my old diet at home very bland and boring. Luckily I have been given lots of recipes and ideas and I also picked up another cookbook in the mall. So if anybody wants to come round, its hands only, no cutlery!

Goodbye
Friday 25 January 2013

We have said goodbye to our sixth set of hosts today. Jangannadh and Vidya have looked after me very well in Shimoga and Yashas sends us off with a high five. We have a five hour bus journey to Mangalore, along some of the best (or worst?!) roads we have seen. I still can’t believe that people drive on roads like this. There are craters, not potholes, and drivers overtaking on corners. This road has hairpin bends as we go down the side of a huge mountain. It’s all worth it for the views though! We are back in Mangalore for the district conference where we will be presenting to over 3000 people. Good job we have had lots of practice on this trip. And we don’t want to rub it in, but it is 35 degrees here in Mangalore. Enjoy the snow!

I think we have all learned to expect the unexpected on this trip but my vocational visit to a government-run hospital and medical college in Shimoga certainly put me to the test. I thought that catching sight of students working on a cadaver in Mangalore was enough but here I got to see much more than I had ever thought (hoped) I would see in my entire life! I was taken on a tour of the anatomy department of the medical college where there were lots of different body parts on display, including embryos. However, I was then taken into another room where there were brains on slabs waiting to be dissected. I was then told to go through to a small back room and to get close to a tank. Well, there was not just one but three bodies in it! I also saw chopped up body parts in another basin. This tour was not long after breakfast so I’m very pleased I did not have any adverse reactions to what I saw!

Back in the district hospital, I was taken round the paediatric ward and gave the children a small toy to play with. I was informed that families are educated about the importance of nutrition and that meals are tailored to the needs of the children. The mothers of babies that require hospital treatment are able to stay in a separate ward so that they can continue to breast feed. I also visited the intensive care unit where I was surprised to see so many twins.

I then had the opportunity to speak to a member of staff about some of the issues that healthcare services in England face and I was told that there are some similarities. The hospital does not conduct any form of quality of care assessment but does have a very open complaints and suggestions policy. Patients can contact relevant hospital staff directly by telephone 24/7 and any issues are looked into straight away.

This was my last vocational visit of the trip and I have had the opportunity to see things that I would not be able to see back home. I haven’t quite managed to get the full picture of healthcare services so I may have to come back!

Cheeeeese...
Thursday 24 January 2013

Vidya let me into her kitchen today to show me how she makes some of the South Indian cuisine I have been enjoying here, including idly, roti and coconut chutney. I hope I can find the ingredients at home so that I can share them. I also got a chance to play with Yashas and the young neighbour from upstairs. It is quite common here for neighbours and family to walk in and out of each other’s homes. The door always seems to be open, especially in these smaller communities. I was really interested to see that Yashas toy kitchen has all of the traditional Indian utensils. I’m sure the kids at home would be a bit confused by this!

Today is my fifth and final vocational day and I’m visiting KUVEMPU University, along with Angie and four Rotarians. I was delighted when I walked in and spotted a sign for the Public Relations office. I have already visited Manipal University and Mysore University and both said that they didn’t have a PR or communications department so they showed me their journalism faculty instead. KUVEMPU is ranked 92nd out of 4000 universities. However, when I

asked about measurement, it seems that the results are all based on what the university says about itself and there is no form of student satisfaction or performance measurement.

First stop is the Vice Chancellors office where we meet Dr. Bari. The chancellor of the university here is the state governor. The university is 25 years old and it caters for a rural and tribal population. To support this, there are 81 affiliated colleges across the state and the university has 55,000 students in total. There are five faculties; Social Sciences, Humanities, Science and Technology, Law and Education. There are 4,000 postgraduate students and 70% of all students are female. This university is more like the university where I work, the University of Cumbria, than any of the others I have visited here. Dr. Bari tells us that the university is highly subsidised by the government and a social sciences student for example would only pay around 3000 rupees per year (about £30 if my calculations are right!).

The students here are well motivated as the country has had a big focus on education for the last ten or 15 years. The economy has opened up and people
KUVEMPU university
are attracted by the employment opportunities available within private companies. Course options fluctuate though as most parents want their children to be engineers or doctors. It means that basic sciences and social sciences are falling out of fashion. The dropout rate is low, just 1%, but of those who do leave, the boys go to seek paid employment opportunities and the girls often have to leave to get married if their parents are offered a good match before they finish their education.

When I ask them what their biggest challenges are, I’m told that the university always struggles with money, despite being funded by the government. They also say that students have much higher expectations when it comes to facilities and lots of welfare measures have recently been introduced for students and staff. They also bring up the topical international visa issue which has been rumbling in UK universities. They want to know what we do about it and if we need more international students in our universities. The staff here, and most of the people we talk to day to day, can’t believe that all of our schools are government funded. Here, only the poor children go to
Meeting the VC
government schools. We also have a very interesting discussion about how Indian people look down upon people in certain professions. Yet, in the UK, we respect skilled people who work hard.

Despite asking again to visit the PR office, we are taken to the management institute where we meet around 100 students. It’s strange to see them in a uniform as I can’t imagine UK students sticking to a uniform rule. We are getting used to giving impromptu presentations and after telling them about my job, the staff and students ask me some questions which cover the things to consider in public relations, the importance of business ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and the qualities of a good manager when it comes to communication and CSR. The management institute encourages entrepreneurship and they work with the local Chamber of Commerce and private businesses to offer placements and experience. The government has its own programme for business start up and sustainability but it doesn’t associate with any university when delivering this.

I ask again to visit the PR office and I am taken to meet a man who has responsibility for PR, however he is a full time
Student talk
academic and there are actually three staff in another office that do the day to day PR activity. The frustrating thing with the vocational days is that we are not always getting to talk to the right people, the ones who could tell me about how the PR office works here and discussions around the differences in the UK. He does tell me that the three staff also do all of the marketing activity and one writes, one types up the writing and the other distributes the information to the media or other stakeholders. They do not have any sort of expert datatbase, they don’t use social media, they have a press meeting with the VC once a month and they publish an internal magazine but it seems to be more about research papers than anything else.

While this may be working for them now, newspapers and media are growing across India and I can imagine that in around 20 years time, the university will have to invest more resources in public relations and communications.

The Hawa Mahal
So today we have a full day to explore around the city of Jaipur. It is billed as one of the best places in India to see and experience. Just from what I saw last night I am sure it is.

We all met for breakfast around 8 and then had the bus ready for us at 9 to take us out and about town for some extraordinary site seeing. We started with a trip to see the Hawa Mahal. It is the second most photographed building in India (guess what the first is). It was built in 1799 to enable the women of the court to watch the processions. Very generous of the local rulers since women were usually not allowed near the celebrations at all. It has hundreds of windows where they used to sit behind and watch things pass. Amazing building.

After that it was a drive just out of the city to the Amber Fort. It sits up on a hill overlooking the town of Amber. It looks like something out of an Indiana Jones movie up on the hill. We walked up to the fort weaving our way in between elephant processions and other
The Amber Fort
tourists. The elephants all had seats one op for ther people to ride up the hill but we walked as the view is quite majestic and hoestly it seemed cruel what they were doing to the elephants in thsee conditions.

Once up to the fort, we got to see some beautiful architecture and imagine what life would have been like back in the day. There were rooms for Royal viewing sessions, rooms for the concubines of the Mugul and rooms that seemed to have no reason but were spectacular none the less. We had a guide but I could sooo see getting lost in here or running around as child in the hayday of the complex and exploring. Great place as a kid to get into trouble and explore.

On the way back to the city we stopped to see the Water Palace. Quite a spectacular building set out ins he middle of a man made lake for the relaxation and summer enjoyment of the moguls. Wow. Every state and city seem to have something that stands out and makes it amazing in its own right.

Then we hit the textile market and saw the handprinting of
Elephants through the Amber Fort gate
fabric with wooden blocks and vegtables ink and onto the gem polishing businesses. This region is known for its fabrics and gems. I could have gotten a ruby ring for just under $200 which at home would have cost me a lot more...but I don't wear jewels. A lot off the jewels the British used in their regal adornments were from this region.

Then we had dinner at an old Heritage Hotel...Hotel Naran Niwas Palace. The Heritage Hotel system here was started after the country gained independence from the British to help preserve the old Mogul homes and estates. The families were given a choice...pay taxes on the properties from now on or hand them over to the national government. Many families chose to make them into hotels to keep them in the family and make money at the same time. They are beautiful structures with amazing history and beautiful designs. They have a very royal feel to them. At this one we had dinner under a tent out on the lawn while they had musicians play and dancers perform. We also got to see a Rajisthani puppet show. Very cool!!

In all it was a great day!!!

January 23rd 2013
Published: January 23rd 2013


On my first night in Shimoga, my host took me to a centre that cares for people who are not able to look after themselves and who have no-one else to care for them. The centre was established in 2007 by a gentleman whose aim in life is to serve others. The majority of the people who are cared for at the centre are people with physical disabilities, though there are also people with mental ill health. 280 people have received care from the centre since it opened.

As soon as I walked into the centre, I saw that there were three occupied beds surrounding the office desk and the television was blaring. The main room off this had at least eight beds but also two people sleeping on the floor. The third room, which was quite small, had three beds. Both males and females slept in each of the rooms. The whole centre lacked any form of ventilation so you can imagine the odour emanating as a result of the heat and the lack of hygiene and cleanliness. I was told that the centre can accommodate up to 30 people at a time, which I found difficult to visualise, as the three rooms were already packed full of beds.

Ten staff provide personal care services. The owner will do anything and everything for the people he welcomes into the centre. No specialist training is provided though the appropriately qualified staff are brought in as required. Doctors voluntarily visit the centre to check on the residents who are all fully dependent on other people. I was told that all they want is to be touched (as if they are a child) and to see other people. People from local social / sports clubs visit the residents but there are no other activities for the residents to engage in.

In a medical emergency, the owner would transport the individual to hospital. I did not see any walking aids or wheelchairs though. Donations are given to the centre and the owner believes any challenges can be overcome. Somehow, the centre finds sufficient funds to provide care to people who may otherwise have nothing. I was pleased to hear that a new site has been found for the centre, which will be next to a new hospital that is being built.

The owner’s dedication to help others is humbling and I hope that local communities continue to support his work.

Dancing elephant
Wednesday 23 January 2013

During the last three weeks, all of us at some point have had to face challenges, cope with difficult situations and become very adaptable to a very different way of life. I think we are all coping remarkably well and we will be sad to leave here in ten days time.

Today started with a ride on an elephant. I also had my first experience of an elephant dribbling down my back and hitting me over the head with its ear at Sakraibail camp. One of the young elephants was showing off and it almost looked like it was dancing for us! This was followed by a Lion and Tiger safari. Although these ones were not completely wild at Bandipur, it was great to see such beautiful animals up close and personal. We also get a chance to visit Shivappanayaka Palace where there are some beautiful wood carvings. I would like to take one of these pieces home for my fireplace!

Back to the more serious stuff, we visited a number of projects supported by the seven Rotary clubs in the Shimoga area. First was some low cost housing in Lakshmipura village on the
Low cost homes
outskirts of the city. The houses were built to support families working in agriculture. I’m pretty sure that the whole village turned out to see us here and they all walk in and out of each other’s homes. This seems to happen a lot in the smaller towns and cities in a way that I don’t think it would in the UK. The houses are small but ideal for the needs of the families and cost just £750 to build.

We also visit a local school supported by Rotary. The kids here also have a Rotaract club which they tell us about. Although they are not quite as confident as the children in the private school we visited earlier this week, Rotaract is helping them to progress. We all present to them and explain our jobs and a bit about life in the UK. Opening the floor for questions was interesting when they asked me about sex education. This isn’t something they will have come across here and I have already had an interesting chat with my host family about a very similar subject.

At the blood and eye clinic we learn about how Rotary are supporting blood
Lion and Tiger safari
collection and distribution in the area. The Government are keen to support blood donation here. Finally, we head to Asha Kirana, a school for children with severe learning disabilities. This school has 48 pupils who board here and it is quite different from the other special schools we have visited in India, much noisier and uncontrolled. We are told that the children are particularly distressed as most were tied up all day when they were living at home. Their parents had to go out to work so the children were left outside, soiled and hungry. The school has taken them in and they live here for 11 months of the year. The parents visit for two weeks and are taught how to care for the children and given targets to meet while they take their child home for the twelfth month of the year. If the child meets those targets, they can return the following year.

We meet a 32 year old woman who was a resident here and now helps the younger children. When the school opened 26 years ago, she was a six year old girl, dumped by her parents who gave a false address and could

not be traced. She was supported by the school and the Rotarians and she has even managed to overcome some of her medical conditions. The school aims to get all of these children back into mainstream education to prevent the stigma placed upon them and their parents.

At home with my hosts, Vidya tells me all about the meals she prepares, the ingredients and preparation. Many of my hosts have been homemakers so they spend a lot of time and effort cooking. And they have staff to help with the cleaning too. Our hosts live by the mantra that ‘the guest is God’ and are keen to feed you lots of food. They can’t understand that we don’t eat so much at home, particularly at breakfast time. Although I was a bit worried that Indian food would be too spicy for me, it has been really nice to try out lots of different things, with and without spice and pepper. South Indian food has so much taste and variety and I will come away with lots of ideas. I have already bought one cook book and been given another as a gift. Just hope I can find a shop
Lunch. Yum!
at home that sells some of the things I need!

All in all, it’s been a very thoughtful day. We are seeing things here that we would probably never get the chance to see in the UK and it makes you realise and appreciate what you have.

Belur host house
Angie and Emily stayed on Chetana Halli Estate
Since Mysore, we have been staying in the beautiful coffee region of Belur. We were all fortunate enough to be hosted by coffee planters on their plantations. Emily and I stayed with a wonderful old man, Ganghia, and his wife, Vashanta. He is evidently highly respected by everyone in the region, deservedly so, it seems to us. His son is the owner of India's largest coffee shop chain, Cafe Coffee Day and apparently one of India's richest people. He is also, we are told, an unassuming man like his father.

The house where we stayed was built about 150 years ago by a coffee planter from Wales. Ganghia's family bought it in the 1940's and have built it up to its 11,000 acres of today. He took us on a tour, showing us the difference between arabica and robusta plants, how they grow in the shade of tall trees such as silver oak and teak, and are interspersed with pepper and cardamom. He then showed us how the beans are washed and dried for seven days in the sun.



We visited some interesting temples, one of which involved climbing 716 steps. There are said to be a

thousand, but I counted far fewer. It was very good to be out in the lovely weather. Our host for the day told us only after he had negotiated all those steps that he had a heart problem! Jain and Hindu temples visited later had the most intricate carvings of animals and gods. In one I was given such a very special holy garland that I could barely carry the weight around my neck.



The giving of garlands and individual flowers, generally roses, is a common custom to honour guests. We have been given so many. Apparently after use it is customary to leave them under a jack fruit tree to wither away.



While in the Belur region we also visited some friendly Rotary clubs, an Interact club and a college named after Ganghia, where village students over 16 are taught English and trained in various subjects in preparation for working for Cafe Coffee Day. They are given six months training with free board, food, uniform and education. They are then required to work for the company for two years, after which they are free to choose whether to stay with the company or

get a different job. The college is in immaculate condition.



We were also shown Ganghia's son's very smart resort hotel, where for a mere £330 a night one can rent an opulent suite, complete with its own pool. The inclusion of a helipad may suggest the wealth of their clientele!



Now we move on to Shimoga for further new experiences.

Diane administering life saving polio vaccines
After a very hectic schedule, I welcomed the opportunity to stay in the middle of a coffee plantation, sit out on the veranda basking in the sun, and wake to the sound of birds singing each morning. Our journeys to, from, and surrounding the areas of Hassan and Belur may have been quite long but it was so good to see some countryside again. The highlight for me had to be the visit to Shravanabelagola where we climbed barefoot up the vindhyagiri hill to a Jain temple. As well as enjoying getting my first bout of exercise on this trip, I took in fantastic views of the city and the gommateshvara statue. We visited two other temples during our time in the Hassan district – the Hindu Hoysaleswara temple at Halebeedu and the Chennakeshava temple complex at Belur. Both of these are amazing architectural feats. A special puja ritual was performed for us and Angie was adorned with a rather grand flower garland – a great honour.

The next excitement was visiting three polio immunisation booths. I had the opportunity to give polio drops to two children – it was not as easy as you think! It was good to see a group of children attending one of the booths and the commitment and hard work of the Rotarians and healthcare workers manning these booths was greatly appreciated by the families.

We also saw rotary in action when we visited a school’s Interact club. The young ladies all spoke with great enthusiasm and confidence about the activities they are able to engage in through rotary. It was really good to hear young people talk this way; they clearly valued the experience and I’m sure they all have bright futures ahead of them.

Back at my host’s house, I started reading the best book about yoga I have ever come across and was inspired by his views on yoga and meditation. All in all, even with all the extra visits that were slotted into our visit to the Hassan district, I felt it was a place where I could spend some quiet time reflecting on what we have experienced so far on our journey. Reading the yoga book will make my journey home slightly more bearable but I don’t want to think about that just yet, as there is so much more to see and do here!

January 22nd 2013
Published: January 22nd 2013


For my vocational day in Mysore, three very different visits had been arranged for me. The first of these was to a 90-bed private hospital that is part of an international chain of hospitals providing world-class healthcare. It opened in 2009 and recently achieved accreditation with international standards. A community ethos is an integral value for the hospital; free / concessional clinics are offered every month. Although I have not visited a private hospital in England, the facilities, services, and operational procedures I observed and was informed about were in line with what I would expect and hope to see in any hospital.

I was slightly surprised that the hospital had only one ambulance (with access to a back-up). The emergency department was only set up with three beds, though it could accommodate six and could also use the entrance hall / waiting area in the event of a disaster (room for an additional 6 beds). If the hospital is unable to provide treatment immediately, it sends patients to its sister hospitals nearby, providing any necessary first aid before transfer.

As a private, corporate, hospital, it does not experience the same issues as government-run hospitals. For example, it is able to offer higher salaries and attract the best surgeons. It also has an effective workforce planning system to ensure that patient care does not suffer. The most impressive aspect for me was the company’s commitment to supporting its staff; time is set aside every day for staff training.

My second visit of the day was to a District Health Office where I was told that key priorities relating to maternal and child health were all improving, such as institutional deliveries, and infant and maternal mortality rates. Programmes that focus on population stabilisation also continue to be implemented. There are, however, constant challenges, such as the infrastructure and shortage of manpower for medical and specialist services.

The final visit was to an Ayurvedic Centre. I was pleased to hear that they take an integrated approach to healthcare, ensuring that guests are referred as necessary for the most appropriate form of healthcare. Everybody receives an individual assessment and their treatments and food are customised accordingly. The centre has recently started an Ayurveda cooking class for its staff and may open this up to the public in the future. Training packages are available for people who wish to achieve certification in specific Ayurveda treatments so I may well find myself back in Mysore!

Angie and her garland
Monday 21 - Tuesday 22 January 2013

Can’t believe that we have been in India for almost three weeks now! Time is flying and we have been so lucky to see and do all of these amazing things.

Our last day in Belur is spent at two rotary meetings and visits to two temples and a school. It is great to go along to the informal rotary meetings as you get a chance to learn about the people, the club and the projects they support. Many of them are school or healthcare projects as their government does not fund these in the way that our Government does. Belur temple is very beautiful and inside, they perform a special type of worship for us, presenting Angie with a massive garland of flowers. Onwards to Mudigere where we attend the second meeting and visit a Rotaract club at the school across the road. The kids in the club are great at public speaking and they are very dedicated to the club. There is no doubt that it has also helped to build their confidence. The younger kids at the school are delighted to see us and Emily and Nicola are mobbed!
Research and development
Taste testers


Angie and Emily are staying with a family who own a coffee estate and have built up an empire of coffee shops called Cafe Coffee Day. Everywhere you look here, you see a Cafe Coffee Day, it is as big as Costa or Starbucks in the UK. Emily and Angie will be able to explain more about it but their host wants to show us some of the projects they fund. These include a school and a vocational training centre where they teach poorer people English and hospitality skills before giving them a job in their chain. The kids here seem genuinely grateful for the opportunity to better themselves. We also visit a meditation centre funded by the family and also the Cafe Coffee Day research centre. They won’t want us to write too much about their research but it all looks great and I’m pretty sure that in the very near future, we could see Cafe Coffee Day on the British high street. I’m going to look them up when I get home and read more about their CSR across wider India.

Tonight is a party, hosted by my family Rajendra and Janhavi. I can’t wait to
Party at our house
We don't want to leave our host family
have everybody round for drinks and food. I want to show the other girls the fantastic home which me and Nicola have been welcomed into. All of the host families and other members of the Rotary club join us for some refreshments and an amazing spread of food. I’m really sad to say goodbye to Rajendar and Janhavi in the morning. We have had a fantastic time and been treated so well, considering they got landed with two of us instead of one. Janhavi has given us some beautiful gifts, including some coffee which was made on their very own estate. With sad faces, we leave Belur for Shimogga. But we can never stay sad for too long as moving onto our next place is always exciting. This will be our sixth set of hosts and we are welcomed with garlands, flowers and tender coconut.

I am staying with Jagganadh and Vidya and their 21 month old grandson Yashas. Jagganadh owns a petrol station with his brothers and Vidya is a homemaker and full time grandmother. Their daughter and son in law are doctors living in the UK and they come home to visit Yashas when they can. He
Yashas....too cute
He likes English nursery rhymes!
speaks to them on the phone all the time and I even have a chat with his mum when she calls from Nottingham. They take me out to a local Country Club where Yashas likes to play in the park and we also visit their local temple. I have quite a deep and meaningful conversation with Vidya when she asks me about religion and life in the UK. She comes up with quite a few things that make me have a little think about my life and my beliefs. This is a genuinely lovely family and I’m sure that I can learn a thing or two from them while I’m here in Shimogga.

Beautiful Belur home
Rajendra and Janhavi
Saturday 19 – Sunday 20 January 2013

We said a fond farewell to our Mysore hosts and headed off to Hassan today, ready for our fourth vocational day. I visited a local newspaper printed in the local language of Kannada. I think what has surprised me most is that the paper costs 150 rupees for just four pages. To put that into context, we bought supplies of biscuits, sweets and juice at a supermarket and it only cost 80 rupees (about £1). Yet the paper is increasing in popularity as more and more people want to keep up to date with local politics. Unexpectedly, the editor took the opportunity to throw a camera and microphone in my face and then tell me that he also runs a local TV channel. It’s hard to be part of an interview without any questions though. I asked him what he wanted to know and he wasn’t exactly sure himself! I managed to cobble something together. Those who know me will know that this it wasn’t too much of a problem for me to keep talking!

After the vocational days we headed to our next home........wow! That’s all I can say! Due to
800 steps.....
some unforeseen circumstances, Nicola is also staying with my host for the next three days and we both feel like we have walked into heaven. Rajendra and Janhavi own a 200 acre coffee estate. The house is a new build but reflects the style of most coffee estates in this area and has British influence. So, as well as having an amazing fireplace, we also have our own bar! The house is packed full of beautiful pieces of antique furniture and books about foreign destinations they have visited. We have our own twin rooms and bathrooms bigger than our own homes. Oh, and a cook. I don’t think we will want to leave Belur!

It’s an early start on Sunday morning. 5am to be precise! But I wake up to find out that I’m front page news here. And I was on the local TV news last night. I’m not sure that it was factually correct but I can’t read the local language anyway so I will let that one slip I think!

We need to get up early to enjoy the views at the top of Shravanbelagola, a Jain temple, and there are 800 steps to walk
Shravanbelagola
up on the way. It is certainly worth it as we get to the top and see the shrine and watch worship rituals taking place. It’s fair to say that we would never get an opportunity like this anywhere else and it is amazing to watch people who are so involved in their beliefs. I think that the one disappointment for me is the young girls with babies and children who are begging us for money. We haven’t seen much of it here as we are staying with relatively wealthy families and not visiting too many tourist areas. However, when we do see it, it makes me very emotional and it’s hard not to offer them the money in your purse. Some of them are so young and even the children are calling for you to give them food. Time to put the sunglasses on and pretend I’m not crying at the sight of them.

On the bus, we also get to see more of rural India. This area seems to have a bigger Muslim population as we see men in traditional dress on the streets. There also seems to me to be fewer women around here. Transport here
Polio immunisation
is amazing and you see a bus packed with people, often jumping on and off while moving, cyclists grabbing a lift by holding the back of a truck, bull carts packed with huge amounts of straw, families of five on one two-wheeler and trucks packed to bursting with people hitching a lift.

We stop off at three Rotary Polio Immunisation stations around the town. Today is a national immunisation day and children under five are brought to the stations to have drops placed on their tongue and purple ink put on their left pinkie finger to show they were immunised. Thanks to Rotary, Polio has almost been completely wiped out in India. We are told that although the stations are not so busy, they have to have lots of them dotted around the city to encourage people to come. If they see a queue they will simply drive past without stopping.

After presenting for the fifth time, this one for the Hassan and Belur clubs, we head to Halebeedu and see an ancient temple with intricate carvings. Unfortunately some of this has been ruined by invaders hundreds of years ago. This evening we have been able to spend
Halebeedu temple
some time with our hosts Rajendra and Janhavi. They have shown us around their estate, including the coffee pulping and drying areas, the crops and then the viewpoint on a hill behind the house, looking over the Western Ghats. Stunning. Rajendra and Janhavi have many family members who own adjoining estates and much of the land we can see is theirs or their relatives. Rajendra explains that the drought is affecting his business and he can’t tell from year to year how it will be. This is one job where nature really does make a difference. The pepper which they also grow here helps to keep the business going.

Mysore Palace
Illuminated weekly on Sundays from 7pm - 8pm
Just as we are thinking that Indian driving is chaotic, we come to Mysore and discover traffic lights, traffic police and CCTV cameras checking on road use. So you see traffic waiting at junctions to allow others to cross, a sight not seen in Mangalore. I must apologise to our Indian hosts if I seemed critical of their roads.

Mysore is a beautiful city, with many interesting old buildings as well as some very attractive houses, which appear to come from the Art Deco movement. There is also some innovative modern architecture. The station is housed in an attractive Victorian building, but the star is Mysore Palace.

The present palace was built in 1912 to replace the previous one, which was built in 1800 and burnt down. The current palace is full of beautiful carved doors and ceilings and interesting murals of events in the lives of the royal family. Elephants abound and gold adorns palanquins. We were lucky enough to see the palace lit up on Sunday evening where from 7pm - 8pm each week 1000's of people gather to watch the switch on. It was quite amazing and certainly gave Blackpool illuminations a run for their money!!!
Prince of Mysore's personal collection of taxidermy
Most of these animals were killed in the 40's & 50's. Impressive sight up close as so realistic!
Later in the week we also took part in a special guided tour of the palace which allowed us access to secret rooms not open to the public. Parts of the architecture reminded us of Buckingham Palace and similar to our Queen's residence and similarly the current Prince lives behind the main building (away from tourists!!!).

The team are coping remarkably well with the exchange. They are a lively group of people, very keen to learn. They show a real interest in everything there is to learn here in Karnataka and are genuinely grateful for all that is being done for us. There is plenty of humour too; they really enjoy laughing together. All in all it is a very well chosen group of people, so congratulations are in order for the D 1190 GSE interviewing panel. David Simpson would be pleased to see what fun they enjoy.

Thursday 17 – Friday 18 January 2013

Thursday starts with a trip to Infosys campus. Infosys is a huge success story for India and the men behind the software company have created a global success story over the past 30 years. Infosys is a NASDAQ 100 company with offices across the globe. They employ more than 50,000 people and this Global Education Centre in Mysore is like a holiday village for the thousands of trainees who stay here every year. The company believes that staff will work better and train harder when they are well looked after so the site has its own accommodation, food court, bowling alley, gym facilities, cinema, swimming pool and even shops, housed across 110 buildings. It is similar to a Centre Parcs holiday camp in the UK, except top software experts are learning their trade here. It seems quiet on our visit and we are told this is the effect of the recession in the west. Despite this, the company still appears to be leading the way in training and client satisfaction.

At Mysore Palace, we get VIP treatment and are allowed to visit some areas which are closed to the public, including a
Roar...
room displaying all of the weapons used throughout the history of the palace and then a taxidermy room. The animals displayed here are amazing. The palace itself is beautiful and well maintained. The prince still lives in part of it.

For the meeting tonight, Anu, Nimisha and her friend all want to dress me up in a traditional outfit. I don’t mind at all as they spend more than an hour wrapping me in some beautiful silk, adding gold jewellery and a bindi for the finishing touches. Nimisha has also put mehendi on one of my hands. It looks fantastic and feels very elegant.

Early start for a Friday as I’m joining Nimisha and her friend on their daily walk around the local lake to watch the sun rise. It really is beautiful, though the girls are feeling the cold. We joke that they should try getting up on a January morning at home, then they will know what cold is!

Today we visit Jaganmohan Palace to take in the artwork on display. There are some beautiful pieces here, including furniture and trinkets, and many have links to the British history of India. We head onwards to
Mehendi
Bandipur Tiger Reserve, which turns out to be quite an experience for some of the group! As well as seeing hundreds of wild boar and monkeys playing and carrying their young, we see some tamed elephants working in the national park. The park covers hundreds of square miles of forest land and the team here are working to protect the area and increase the number of wild animals living here. Before we take our safari trip, we are given a lodge to relax in. After a tour of the information centre, we make use of the lodge. However, one of the monkeys got a bit too close to Angie for comfort and started hissing, before trapping Nicola on the balcony as it tries to make its way into the lodge. Luckily, a security guard came to the rescue! Honestly ladies, I leave you all alone for ten minutes and you can’t cope!!

On the safari, we are lucky enough to see a huge variety of wild animals, including a herd of elephants. It obviously wasn’t our day as one of the elephants also attempted to warn us off while protecting its young. Little bit scary to be honest!
Traditional dress
Me with Anu

Tonight we get a little bit of time with our hosts and I have a discussion with Anuradha about their local newspaper and the stories and adverts it prints. Todays headine is about a tiger attacking a local photographer! Some of the job adverts are very discriminative but Anu explains that it also works the other way too. She has campaigned for years to provide better employment opportunities for differently able people and it is paying off now and they are seeing results. It is hard to believe that it’s already our last night in Mysore! The Nandakumar family have been lovely hosts and it has been great spending time with them here in their home. The food has been particularly nice!

Papaya and me
Current Mood: Sore!

Leaving Udaipur was sad to say the least. Since Mumbai this was the best place we had been so the idea of moving on was a real tempt of fate. However the time had come to say goodbye to Raju and his family so on our last evening we paid up our bills took a cheeky shower in Raju’s bathroom and set out for a ready booked night bus (none AC).

On arriving at the booking agents where we would check in, we were advised that our non AC cheap bus would be delayed up to three hours due to an accident that had caused a road block. There was no way that I was about to sit around for three hours as wouldn’t any tourist I imagine so I quickly enquired about catching an earlier AC bus at 300 rupees per person more. “ahh sir this is a very good choice you can get this bus now if you go quickly I can make it wait for you and your friends” (what he meant to say was “ Ahh sir this is a very good choice as it was always your only choice. There is
old laneways
no such thing as a non AC bus going to Jaisalmer but we pull this scam every night to get more money from your pocket. If I offer you the cheap one of course you come to me and then I get you for 100 rupees more than the guy down the road”) Cheers pal…. This must be India man! The bus ride, however bumpy it got, was a good one and 12 hours later we crawled out of our double beds and were greeted by our Camel Safari manager Sewai who operates as ‘The Real Desert Man’ and is number one on Tripadvisor at the time of writing.

Sewai was exactly what I expected of an Indian Business Man. Really tall, bit of a gut, and a cracker of a handle bar Mo, but most importantly very informative and super friendly. From the Day we spoke with him he kept in touch over the phone and by email, collected us from the station even though we were not to stay with him, took us to his office, gave us Chai and then dropped us to our rooms inside Jaisalmer Fort where we were booked in with Sagar guesthouse.
Beer on the Balcony
Things once again were looking up.

Arriving inside of the fort walls was amazing. You enter from the eastern side and come through three or four main gates before landing in the main square. The square is set alongside the fort palace which is a grand structure that seems to tower high up above the fort walls. From the square there are many routes that you can follow but all come back to the main arena. The further into the forts lanes you get the quieter it becomes. The rickshaw drivers disperse and the touts and shops appear all selling beautiful toilet paper, “CHILD BEER”, sun glasses clothes and books. In fact there isn’t much that you can’t get here. From the 1400’s or 1500’s this area was part of the camel train where all sorts of goods would be sold inside the walls. To this day the things on sale may differ but there is still a roaring trade that goes on from tours, restaurants and guesthouses alike.

Pulling up outside of Segar we found that after two hours of waiting for our booked rooms to come free the staff were a little too relaxed. The guys
Water hole
inside our rooms, that were supposed to check out hadn’t and wouldn’t so after a crazy discussion with the owner where he nearly started to cry we thought it best to just leave and find somewhere a little more relaxed. (I must say that even though the owner got a little heated, over the next few days we ran into each other quite often and he always shook my hand and offered me tea. No hard feelings but Checkout times must amount to something).

So Joe and Annie, after searching for all of five minutes found us a room next door at Desert Haveli and for 700 rupees per night we got to sit way above the fort walls looking out over the city and vast desert that we would get to experience in a few days time. For now though lets enjoy this 12 box of beers the owner has put into the fridge for us. Big ones too.

For the next few days inside the Fort walls we just moseyed around, grazing at two to three restaurants a day including 8th July which is run by a very funny Australian resident, Jaisalmer born elder fella and
Leelu and Moona
his wife Rama. Go in and you will be amazed at how passionate she is about getting you to try different food. My guts didn’t know what to do with it all. They weren’t bad but the food was a test of my manliness. “SHIT SPICEY MAN” Rama would say! And then walk away laughing at my face. She is located in the main square. After grazing we always went back to our roof after enjoying a few cool hours in the beautiful rooms. The only drawback about Jaisalmer is the amount of mosquitoes there. Make sure you are loaded up with repellent and coils for outside of your room. If you forget the coils and leave windows open it turns into Midnight War.

After being held back an extra day by the threat of a sand storm created by ex-cyclone Nilofar we eventually got to go out into the desert. This was exciting times. Waking nice and early for our collection in the main square we hopped onto a jeep and was taken to drop off our extra luggage at one of Sewai’s hotels for safe keeping. From here the trip would begin.

For an hour or
Leelu setting up. Papaya in the background
so we would visit a little abandoned village and a nice little water hole that they insist are lakes but once out of the jeep the real adventure begins. We arrived to see five camels, all but one sitting quietly, waiting for us to be introduced. First we would meet the camel guys, Leelu and Moona and they then got to work on setting up our supplies and saddling it all up on top of the camel’s backs. Casey was introduced to Raju, a peaceful chap who seemed to behave for the entire trip, Annie was introduced to Balu, (also behaved) Joe was introduced to Allu (like the spud) and myself was then left standing alone with Papaya who was the only camel left, and funnily enough also standing, doing his own sweet thing whenever he could get away with it. He even stood up differently to the other camels. He wouldn’t go straight up in the three step technique of back legs first half way, then front legs up and then straighten out. I was left straddling this beast not knowing on any of the occasions how he was going to stand up this time. Trouble, to say the
Riding in the sun
least. If they ever got the camels to sit so we could get off I had to literally throw my bag off and sort of scramble to the floor before Papaya decided he was going to bolt. After learning all of his quirks however he and I got on like a house on fire.

So off we plod, all enjoying the show from papaya, and me hanging on in this camel train formation of Joe at the front, followed by Casey, then Annie with me taking up the rear. All of the camels were tied together so they would keep moving but this was fine. It is completely different to horse riding as these beasts happily follow each other along unless their name is Papaya. He was a crack up. If he was long leashed he consistently walked alongside the group, dragging me through every tree that the other camels avoided. When he was short leashed he couldn’t move forward to far but would complain and snot everywhere. Apparently it is because he likes to be upfront and see what is going on but he is too quick so this training is to try and slow him down. ""Papaya
trying to find some shade
is a very fast Camel but good Camel... Papaya papaya"" hahaha

Either way we were having a great laugh up the back. Most of the time I was trying to impersonate Papaya and at times he looked like he was responding. After a few hours we stopped for lunch where we would literally sit under a nice tree watching the lads cook up a storm, wondering about the dunes nearby and sleeping. Lunches usually lasted 4 hours to avoid the heat of the day so you had time to just enjoy the scenery with absolutely no other tourists anywhere to be seen nor heard.

After Lunch we would jump up for a few more hours riding in the cooling sun towards our camp for the night, often via local villages where we would get to meet local kids and let the camels rest and drink. The camels on this safari were very well looked after. The guys were always stroking them and talking to them. I tried to stroke Papaya but he wasn’t so sure so from then on I left him to it. The camp sites on both nights were fantastic the lunch spots were great and
Nothing escapes
the Guys Leelu and Moona are second to none. If you can arrange a trip and wait for these boys you will be very happy.

The cost is around 3000 rupees for three days of deep desert action where all food and bedding is provided and set up for you (although I would jump the gun and help with my swag where I could). In the mornings we would be woken with chai and breakfast whilst the guys went out sometimes walking 2km in search of the camels that are allowed to wonder off to eat and play. The whole organisation is great and even on saying goodbye to the tour, Sewai came and met us for food afterwards and also gave us a room to get showered up in, for free until our night time train to Delhi. Before the trek we paid our deposits which is clever of Sewai, as once inside the guys from other companies will try to bad mouth other agents and undercut each other drastically. The only winner from these low prices are the guys you pay the money to, the camel guys are the ones that suffer, putting in all of the
Casey
hard work for a cut wage if the sale is low.

The Real Desert Man is the company to go with in my opinion as biased as it may be. The scenery is private, the animals are looked after and the team are fantastic. Make sure to tip the camel guys as they are worth more than their weight in diamonds, and enjoy everything they expose you to if you can make the time to travel to Jaisalmer.

Right now I am sitting on a train and have been since leaving the desert on route to Delhi. I have an hour left and have been lying here for 19 hours. My plan for the evening is to find a room, slurp a beer, take a shower and go get me some Delhi Belly.

Stay tuned, love to you all, oh and one last word of advice about Jaisalmer. If you meet the bike rental guy who calls himself Al Pacino. Don’t buy a thing off him. “This is India Man”!

Love ya…. Brummy x

Jaisalmer Fort en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaisalmer_Fort

Jaisalmer Fort is one of the largest fortifications in the world. It is situated in the city
Sunset Chai
of Jaisalmer, in the Indian state ofRajasthan. It is a World Heritage Site. It was built in 1156 AD by the Rajput ruler Rawal Jaisal (whose son was Shalivahan II.Manj & Bhati Rajputs are the descendants of him.), from whom it derives it name. The fort stands proudly amidst the golden stretches of the great Thar Desert, on Trikuta Hill, and has been the scene of many battles. Its massive yellow sandstone walls are a tawny lion colour during the day, fading to honey-gold as the sun sets, thereby camouflaging the fort in the yellow desert. For this reason, it is also known as the Sonar Quila or Golden Fort. The fort is located in the very heart the city, and is one of the most notable monuments in the locality.

While we are all enjoying meeting new people, especially with everyone being so warm and welcoming, we are trying very hard to remember names and to pronounce them correctly, not always successfully! We have noticed that this seems to be the case for our names too, over the last week we've come across a variety of new names so I thought share a few with you. Angie has been re-named Angela Briggs, and Di has been changed to Dina and Deyan. Emily is actually a word meaning Tamarind so she is naturally called that and has also had an Amelia. While I have taken to being called Nicole and had my last name changed to Oswald! Tracy seems to be the most awkward, she has gone from Tracky to Tacky to Tacy to Chesy but her favourite is Aunty!! What is simple to us seems to be surprisingly hard for other cultures, it's just nice to know it's not just us!!

Mangalore 1000 pillar temple
Fully hand carved from granite!
Upon arrival in Mangalore we are taken on a city tour and learn about the temple which Mangalore derives it’s name from – Mangaluru Temple and we learn a lot about the Hindu Gods. There are so many to pray to for different traits that it gets a little confusing at times, but the temples are very tranquil places and we spend some time sitting and reflecting on life before leaving each one (usually through the door backwards so you don’t turn your back on the Gods). We are also taken to the impressive 1000 pillar temple which is contructed completely of granite.

Devdas (our GSE Coordinator here in Karnataka) and his wife Reika host us for lunch (along with Devdas’s Mum and Dad) in their apartment and put on a wonderful spread of food. They are strict vegetarians and have taken great care over preparing food without milk products for Nicola.

I am staying with Anil Gonsalves and his wife Bina and their 13 year old daughter Kavya. The family have 2 dogs: 1 is a Dachshund called Toby and the other is an 11 year old retriever called Elise who is nearly blind. Yet another interesting host
Devdas Kamath and family
Devdas is our GSE coordinator here in India and done a fabulous job of arranging our programme!
experience as this time I am living with a Catholic family and spend a long time looking through Kavya’s First Communion photos, which were really interesting. Anil works in pharmaceutical distribution and his is conveniently located underneath the house. They are from Portugese orgin and have travelled the world a lot on family holidays, including a trip to Bethlehem at Christmas to visit the Church of Nativity, as well as Italy, USA and UK.

My vocational visits took place on Tuesday 8th January and I was well looked after by Herman Cornelius Joseph Farrar – amazing name!!! First of all we went to meet Dr Geeta who is an expert in coffee cultivation and studied her Masters in the USA at Pennsylvania. We had a long chat for nearly 2 hours about the markets for coffee here in India and how producers could come together and market direct to customers. It seems to me that we don’t see enough Indian coffee on our shop shelves and yet there are many benefits the coffee grown here could be sold for i.e. the environmental benefits of the multiple crop cultivation over that of the African and South America coffees which tend
7to7 coffee branding
Women owned coffee growing cooperative
to be grown in a monoculture. I learnt about a group of women coffee growers who have started selling their own product under the brand “7to7” and would like to find out more about this project once I am back in the UK.

I gave Dr Geeta a copy of Northern Farmer as I thought she might be interested to read about the agricultural sector in England and she was very kind and gave me a lovely silk scarf. I also tasted my first cup of coffee in about 2 years and it was rather delicious!!! It was made with Arabica beans from her own family coffee estate and had a little milk and some sugar in it – don’t think I could drink it every day, but I was glad I tried it!

Next we head to Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) where Nicola also joins us for the tour. This is a privately funded, cooperative milk processing company and are shown the fully factory from milk tanker arrival to final product. I was really interested to learn about the different products which have much higher milk fat content than in the UK. KMF produces 4 main milk
Death by butter!!!
Nicola couldn't resist a little nibble, despite her lactose intolerance!
products ranging from 3% fat to 6.1%. The plant has the capacity to process 480,000 litres per day and can pasteurise 30,000 litres of milk every hour. At present there is a milk shortage in Mangalore (as it’s a coastal region and more crops are grown than cattle farms) so the milk has to come from slightly further away and at the moment not producing to full capacity. After the tour we got the chance to meet the Managing Director and I didn’t stop firing questions at him!

Farmers are paid approximately 22.7 rupees per litre of milk received at the plant (based on 3.1% milk fat and 8.5% solid fats) and this equates to roughly 3p per litre! 634 farms supply KMF and the Government adds a 2 rupee subsidy to each litre processed and the company only keeps 4 rupees per litre of milk for overheads and business development to fund the cooperative in the future. I think this is a good system and what makes it even more intriguing compared to the UK is that the other subsidies available to farmers are funded by the cooperative itself – cattle feeding troughs, building loans and machinery purchase.
Kalbavi cashew factory
A lot of work goes into producing cashew nuts and I will never complain about the price again!!!
This is all funded via the cooperative mechanism and farmers need to supply KMF with milk for at least 180 days in the year to remain members.

Maria and his wife kindly took me for lunch at a lovely Chinese restaurant called Hao Ching and we shared chicken chow mein and BBQ pork. It was yummy...........

Afterwards they took me to the final visit at the Karnataka State Horticultural Board where I got to ask lots of questions about the subsidies provided to farmers. The “programmes” usually last for 12 months, whereas in the UK we normally have 3 – 5 year schemes. The intervention rate is usually 80% (35% from state and 45% from national government) which is a lot higher than our farming grants in the UK, which are usually around 40 – 60%. Mechanisation and irrigation seem to be the most popular types of grants as a lot of the fruit crops require a lot of labour to harvest and a continuous supply of water. The monsoon season here in South India lasts for 2-3 months during June – Sept and then no rain at all for the rest of the year. Capturing rainwater and re-using waste water are big priority for all businesses, not just agricultural based ones. We have seen a lot of solar panels on properties and energy saving posters on the roadside.

I also found it interesting to learn that the Indian Government farming subsidies provide 50%!o(MISSING)f funding in first instalment and then 50%!a(MISSING)fter completion of project or purchase of machinery , whereas in the UK farmers often have to pay out the full costs and only get reimbursed afterwards. Karnataka. There is also a push here in India to increase the size of organic land as well as encourage biogas plants and bio-digester systems.

So much more has happened in Mangalore that I can’t fit it all into one blog and some of the activities have been mentioned in other blogs, but in summary I’ve also experienced:
- riding a jet-ski on Mangalore beach
- Moodibidri Rotary meeting and then tour of University of Bangalore research farm
- Ice cream at Babba’s
- drank cardamom tea
- tried eating “ice apple” fruit for the first time
- riding passenger on a scooter
- eaten a lot of cashew nuts!!!
- successfully delivered our 3rd presentation (after we had to borrow a travel adapter for my laptop from the hotel!!!)
- drank whiskey and apple juice for the first time

A lot of the things we have seen or talked about in Mangalore have really made me think more about where the products we buy in the UK are from. I will never moan about the price of cashew nuts again after seeing how hard everyone in the factory works!

Will catch up on other blogs ASAP! Take care, Emily X

Gardens
Tuesday 15 – Wednesday 16 January 2013

Lack of wifi here means we can’t keep you all up to date as much as we would like. Some of us have it in some homes and others don’t so we are trying our best to use open networks in malls and shops when we get a moment. Thank you to everybody who has left comments and messages on the blog so far, we all really appreciate them.

Our first full day in Mysore kicks off with a visit to the silk factory which produces the world famous Mysore Silk. Unfortunately (like all the best places) we can’t take photos inside. The process of creating beautiful saris from the spit of silk worms is fascinating; especially the gold threads which make them appear extra special. At the end of the tour we get to take a look around the silk shop to admire the saris, scarves and shirts. We are all a bit like kids in a sweet shop looking through the beautiful colours and designs. Even the poorest people here are dressed beautifully and when we ask about second hand shops, they tell us that people simply pass on old
Crocodile!
saris to maids. However, the saris are so well made and durable that many of them last for years and years.

After meeting our new hosts and visiting their homes, we head to Srirangapatna, the land of Tipu Sultan, and we learn all about the history of his palace, the battles fought and the battles won on this land. My host Anuradha joins us for this trip. Anu is married to Nandakumar and they have two children who live at home. Nimisha is 20 and studies civil engineering at a local university and Nishanth is 27 and works in software production. Anu works for an organisation that aims to develop employment opportunities for adults with learning disabilities. Nandakumar is an engineer and has his own construction company. They are both heavily involved with Rotary, Inner Wheel and the local branch of the national union for builders.

Last stop for the day is Ranganathittu, a bird sanctuary, where we take a boat around the lake and see quite a lot of crocodiles basking in the sun. A quiet night with the family gives me a chance to learn more about them all and we watch the DVD of Mysore
The newsroom
festival so that I can learn more about the city too.

Day two in the city is my vocational day. A lovely Rotarian called Keshav takes me along to the Star of Mysore newspaper, the University of Mysore, and then a church and reservoir with a beautiful temple and hotel for lunch just for good measure!

The Star of Mysore newspaper is one of the best read in south India and a morning copy is printed in Kannada, the local language. The evening copy is in English. News Editor Meera shows us around and explains that there are three reporters and one photographer on demand ready to react to stories across the city. Today there has been a fire at a factory. Most of the news here comes from locals phoning the office. Very few press releases received ever make it to print. The reporters here don’t have any real qualifications. They just need to have good English and a flare for writing. They don’t use social media here, although they do have a website and some news can be found online. The most common news here is crime, major incidents such as the fire, news about religion
St. Philomena's
or community leaders and they have also recently started a column of feng shui. Other contributors do music reviews, columns and features. Local newspaper reach may be declining across the western world as more people go online to hand pick their news, but in India and China, circulation is increasing. As more and more of the population become literate, and as the country is constantly changing and developing, people want to be a part of it and reading a newspaper is an ideal way to learn more.

Next stop is the University of Mysore. They have a big Communication and Journalism Department which has links to Kingston University in London. Media in India is still male dominated but things are changing and the male to female ratio in the faculty is 4:3. The students here are Masters students, 60% of them without any background in journalism. Hundreds of students are applying for the course each year as media becomes a more popular subject. They must study both practical and theoretical classes each day and they produce a newspaper every 15 days, one in English, one in Kannada. Sapna shows us around the faculty. She is a former GSE member
1000 year old temple restoration
from 2008 when she travelled to Brazil.

As we have some free time, Keshav shows me St. Philomena’s Church. From the outside you could be mistaken for thinking you are in Europe. A wedding is taking place inside and the bride is wearing a traditional Indian sari in green and white, topped off with a veil. The church does not look like a traditional church from inside and the vibrant colours make it look and feel quite different. Keshav also takes me to the reservoir. It was created in the 1930’s to store water for agricultural purposes and a town was flooded to create it. However, around eight years ago, the water levels dropped and the 1000 year old temple was visible. A businessman, specialising in liquor, asked the Government to gift the temple to him and he would restore it and relocate it, brick for brick, on higher ground. Maybe his way for making up for his sins around encouraging alcohol consumption?! The reconstruction is still taking place and it looks like a painstaking job! However, as this temple is not yet in use, it’s almost deserted so we get a real chance to look around and enjoy
Chamundi Hills temple monkeys
it. People here are genuinely worried about the lack of water and what it will mean for them. The next state, Tamil Nadu, has an ongoing dispute with Karnataka about water as one particular river runs through both states. Neither has enough supplies and they hope that the water levels will rise in the monsoon season. There are daily updates in the paper about the feud and what might happen.

Next stop is Silent Shores Resort where we have lunch. This is by far the nicest resort I have seen in India and it’s not hard to see why this place attracts international tourists. It looks just like a Caribbean resort except the swimming pool and bar are deserted! And apparently it’s only around £60 per night to stay here. Bargain I think! The team spend the evening in the Chamundi Hills above Mysore. The view is beautiful. There is a mad dash to make it into the temple along with all of the locals so that we can see the idol they are worshiping. This idol fought on the hill and she should bring us good luck. There are monkeys all over the top of the temple and more cows than ever strolling around the streets. After the hills, we go along to watch some traditional singing which is part of a presentation organised by my hosts. The singing is quite unusual and somebody has explained that it is about giving women in India equality.

At home, Nimisha, a movie addict, shows me my very first Bollywood film, Three Idiots. It’s actually quite easy to follow as the languages here seem to have merged together and every third or fourth word is English. The subtitles help too! Nimisha has promised to paint some Mehendi on my hands tomorrow and let me wear one of her Saris too so I’m looking forward to that!

Paradise
13th jan 2013

It's such an amazing feeling.
To be excited. To be really looking forward to the year ahead, to your life ahead.
This is probably the only time I've been away and felt happy that I was going home, I mean I have 2 more weeks the time in the ashram, something I've been looking forward to since I last visited in 2010 but after that I will be back in London. Back to start my new full time contacted job, to start looking for my own place, to find a good salsa and yoga class, to appreciate the insane opportunities London has to offer.
Since I last wrote I've been distressing! I woke up on New Year's Eve to a lovely morning birthday breakfast from Tamzin Demant! 😊
I then surreally went to the boys home, and taught an English class on days of the week, I then went to a party on the family who runs peace child farm which is on the out skirts of Bangalore. All I can say really about that night is, I got chatted up by a 20year old, asked why there were so many white people and then pasted out on a roof.

On the 1st, hungover and bemused Tamzin and I took an a/c over night bus to Gokarna town.

We made our way to Om beach, where we spent 5days bathing in the sun, relaxing and playing cards.

No matter how many times I come to an Indian beach I douth i'll get use to cows on the beach, as I sunbathed one day, a mother cow stopped above my towel and started mooing, until a baby cow came over and began to milk, a strange, strange sight.

We then headed on an overnight train to Fort Cochin, its one of my favourite towns in the south, with nice coffee shops,art galleries and the luxury of brown bread 😊

while wandering around with two boys i'd meet in our hostel we ran into a advert shot, we were immediately accosted and asked to be part of a scene where westerners dance behind and cheer on Indian street dancers, the adverts for Clickon home entertainment, watch out Bolloywood!

A public ferry and a boiling walk brought Tamzin and I to the ladies carriage of a commuter train to Alleppy, paying for general means benches, crowds and a lot of men, not however if you get there early enough to get some room in the ladies carriage. Sat on the luggage rack above 6people on a beach for 3 Tamzin and I listened to our ipods and some became the subject of everyones conversation, we decided to liven things up a little and Tamzin broke out on her guitar, the carriage was alive with smiles, song and as much dancing as is possible on a over crowed train, it was possibly my best journey in Indian, made even better by our destination being my Keralan home, Mandala Beach Huts, Alleppy.

My favourite Sari
14 January 2013

Even though this is our one day off during the trip, and a national holiday, I still manage to wake up at 8am! It’s lovely to enjoy some sunshine beside the pool, read a book and listen to some music. We are staying at the Mysore Sports Club for two nights and we even manage to get to the local mall to do some shopping and use the wifi to update the blog. I think one of the hardest parts about being away is the lack of internet access. Most of us use it every day to access emails, instant messaging and news and information from home. I wouldn’t say that we are home sick by any means but it’s good to send and receive some messages from home now and again. I have seen some beautiful Sari’s, some very traditional and some very modern which appeal to me. The women who wear them here take great care of them and look immaculate when they wear one. In the bigger and more modern cities it is more common to see women in jeans or leggings and tunic tops, though they would wear a Sari for special occasions.
Even Angie wanted a Dominos
I have also bought some books about the history of India, the revolution in India and some cookery books. We take the opportunity to enjoy a Domino’s before we head back to the hotel. On the way we see a yellow cow lying close to a busy road, as you do! Apparently these cows are turned yellow during some local festival celebrations. We are all taking a well deserved break tonight to try to consolidate some of the items we have picked up on our way. There are even discussions about buying extra suitcases to bring it all home! We are not even half way through the trip yet. We are all looking forward to the next part of the adventure, the people we will meet and the sights we will see along the way. Just need to catch up on our sleep first.

India: to summarise so far, 14.01.13
To say that we have been welcomed is an understatement. In India a guest is like a god. Our hosts can not do enough for us. We have been piled up with presents much too heavy or bulky to carry home. One day last week I was taken to a large private school and asked to address the 1,200 students. That was relatively easy, since I could tell them about the Lake District and explain why we were in India. I was then asked to present prizes to the cutest tiny kids, all about five years old. To my surprise, I was told later that most of the students had gone home and told their parents all about me, even remembering my name. Imagine that in a British school! Later in the day I was taken to a meeting, where everyone had heard about me and milled around as if I was some sort of celebrity. This was particularly true of the youngsters. I felt like a pop star. I was followed all evening by a local journalist, who kept thinking of new questions to ask me. His English was really difficult to understand and my answers had to be translated to him. I haven't seen his article yet. It will be interesting to see how closely it reflects what I said. Our hosts have been at pains not to make their food too spicy, but I think they have offered us every type of southern Indian cuisine. They have been fascinated by Nicola, our chef, and she by them. Emily, as an agriculturalist, has also had a very interesting time, gathering all manner of information about a wide range of crops. As for what local Rotarians do for poor people in India, we have heard a lot. We visited a very well appointed school for the mentally challenged, who are hoping that clubs in District 1190 will partner the Mangalore North club in applying for a matching grant to help them to buy a bus to ferry students across Mangalore to get to school. If you could see the traffic and the public bus services, you would recognise how important this is. We in Britain wouldn't dream of letting such vulnerable children travel by public transport and their families are far too poor to pay for private transport. We have also heard about work in the field of health and helping youngsters with solar lamps for when there are power cuts, which prevent them from doing their homework. There is another difference, British children would just use that as an excuse for not working, but education is a high priority for young people here. Other clubs have shown us a home for special needs adults, funded by them, a cancer help initiative and a play school, where I was asked to hand out sweets. One tiny tot was so overwhelmed that he burst into tears. There are so many other initiatives, too numerous to mention. Suffice it to say that we have been impressed by their enthusiasm to help those less fortunate than themselves. To return to traffic, by British standards it is dreadful. It is hard to describe how unconscious they are of anything like traffic lanes. It is just an inexplicable mess. I'll try to take a video of it from the bus window some time. Almost no one wears a seat belt or a crash helmet. I think that's enough for now. Considering this is the IT capital of India, it is most surprising how few homes have Wifi, but I'll email this to you as soon as I can find it. To Tim Keegan and all at Kendal Rotary Club, Len Baseley, David Simpson, Vas (or Vasu, as they would say here), John Alderson and all at the Rotary Club of Upper Eden, Margaret Morrison and all at Kendal Inner Wheel Club Love from Ange

After spending a whole week in Mangalore, and a couple of days in Kushulnagar, it is about time I let you know what I have been doing. We have been kept very busy, as you will have seen from the other team members’ blog entries, so I will try not to repeat anything they have already mentioned!

My host in Mangalore is a laparoscopic surgeon and I was lucky enough to watch him perform two operations and attend his rounds at several hospitals and a private clinic. The main thing that stands out for me is the relationship between the patient and professional. At times, it almost seemed like they were part of one family, as they all spoke to each other with such ease, respect, and friendliness. Even when in pain, or simply concerned about their health, patients always had a smile on their face, and appreciated the doctor’s advice and reassurance.

Although many of the buildings and furnishings I have seen look dated and dirty (i.e. dusty floors, stained linen, etc.), and would not be deemed acceptable in the UK, I was informed that infection rates are lower than in the UK. I looked at a hospital’s infection control policy and was pleased to see its level of detail and clarity. At another hospital, I saw state-of-the-art equipment and facilities and was impressed with an intensive care unit where each patient had their own room and nurse.

The lengthy waiting times we experience in the UK do not exist here. I visited two casualty departments, one on more than one occasion, and I was surprised by how quiet they were. However, I was told that they do get busy, particularly with victims of road traffic accidents. Diagnostic tests and surgical procedures are carried out quickly. In the private clinic my host worked in, patients were able to just walk in and see a consultant.

With a population the size of my county (Cumbria), the vast number, and type, of hospitals in Mangalore is extraordinary. There are also several medical colleges and I caught sight of some students working on a cadaver whilst being shown round one of the colleges!

Aside from the vocational visits, I have enjoyed many activities: a short ride in an auto-rickshaw; a trip to the cinema; an ayurvedic massage; attempting to do the highland fling and play an Indian flute (not at the same time!) in Moodabidri; tasting different flavours of cashew nuts; drinking the best coffee I have ever had in Kushalnagar; and seeing elephants.

The food all of my host families and fellow rotarians have prepared for me has been wonderful and I have really appreciated all their efforts to make sure the food is not too spicy! I am looking forward to seeing everybody again soon at the rotary conference.

Golden Temple
13 January 2013

Our final day in Kushalnagar and it starts early in my home, with loud music, as it is Sunday, the traditional day of worship. I enjoy a traditional Kerala dish for breakfast, rice with green bean curry and then rice with banana and sugar. The bananas here are delicious. It is followed by a dosa and coconut milk chutney. Enjoying this food a lot! Jeny is at mass this morning so I don’t get a chance to say goodbye and Preeth is ill unfortunately.

We are taken to visit two of the towns 18 Buddhist temples. The Tibetans were gifted some land here after their escape in 1959 and they have a community of around 30,000, including 10,500 monks. The temples are beautiful and even though they are a tourist attraction, they are quite peaceful and me and Di spend some time sitting cross legged on the floor taking it all in. That is until we are approached again by locals who want their photos taken with us! This is becoming a regular occurrence and it is obviously because there are very few westerners in this area. It is fairly untouched by international tourists and only
At the temple
attracts local tourists from Bangalore and the surrounding area. When we go shopping, we come across a lot of beggars, including women with children, sitting in the red hot mid day sun. We have been quite protected from this sight up until now as we have not visited many tourist attractions. At the second temple, which seems to be closed to the public, we are able to visit the Dalai Lamas private residence which he uses around twice a year. It is very basic and peaceful. I didn’t know much about the Dalai Lama before but am interested to learn that he is now 77 and has been the Dalai Lama since he was two years old. I am told by a wife of one of the Rotarians that they Buddhists are looking for a new Dalai Lama and they choose a youngster with exceptional talents, who can teach, be knowledgeable and lead the community. They thought they had found such a gifted child but he turned out to be unsuitable. I find this quite hard to get my head around to be honest. How could a community choose a leader at such a young age? Lunch is at a
Mysore Palace
lovely Tibetan restaurant and when I ask for the wifi code it is freetibet2013. Very interesting!

We have to say goodbye to our hosts in Kushalnagar today and move on to Mysore. We have had a nice time in Kushalnagar and all of the hosts here, as well as their families, have looked after us very well. It takes around two hours to get to Mysore, which is a tourist area with a rich history and lots of royal connections. We are staying in the Mysore Sports Club for two nights to give is all some much needed rest. Tomorrow is a national holiday here so it fits in well. I think Nicola must know that I am tired and struggling little today so she has been feeding me ‘Gems’ which are the Cadbury equivalent to Smarties over here, and they still contain all of the E numbers that were removed from our sweets at home a couple of years ago! After being met by Rotary Club members, enjoying more food and tea, we head to our rooms, and then on to watch the lights at Mysore Palace. The lights are only on at the weekend so we have
Well deserved refreshments
to make sure we see it today. Between 7pm and 8pm the Palace is decked out with millions of lights and thousands have turned out to watch. It is very impressive and a brass band is playing British music. I think this is just a taste of what is to come in Mysore.

Tonight, we were able to enjoy some refreshments while watching Premier League football on a big screen outside. A little taste of home but with better weather! It doesn’t take me, Emily and Nicola long to get talking to some locals who engage in a very interesting debate about our very own Royal Family. The locals are very passionate and keen to learn why we are defending our Royal Family. We explain that they are good for our economy as one of our biggest tourist attractions and that their presence in 2012 helped to unite the nation during a difficult period. They seem to have other opinions and our attempts to change the subject don’t seem to work here! What they have to say gives us some food for thought at least!

Bath time
12 January 2013

Our first and only full day in Kushalnagar and we have a busy schedule. First stop is the Dubare Elephant Camp. The twenty elephants here are owned by the Karnataka Forestry Department and used to help move wood in the forest. After the initial excitement of seeing a forty year old daddy elephant and a two year old baby (too cute!), we are a bit shocked to see that they are chained together and struggle to walk far. Their eyes are also watering which makes them look so sad. They each seem to be assigned a handler; some are just young boys with sticks which have a metal hook on one end. They use these to drive the elephants and move them down towards the river. Some sit on the back of the elephants and the elephants helpfully raise their leg as a step to help the handler mount. We have been joined today by a large group of local Rotarians and their families and little Jefy is here too. She is quite a character and is very cheeky! She is a great dancer and also likes music. She tells us that she isn’t scared of elephants
Cooling down
but she is scared of crocodiles, there is one in her river at home apparently, so she chooses not to come into the water!

Me, Emily and Nicola brave the cold water and help to scrub down the elephants as they bathe. They are beautiful, timid creatures with hard and hairy skin. Despite the chains and sticks, they seem to be looked after well and we are able to help feed them some of their daily food intake (and they take a lot!). Instead of taking the boat back to the other side, some of us walk back across the shallow river. It feels great to be out in the sunshine! Although it’s 30 plus degrees here, we have spent most of the trip indoors so far.

The one disappointing thing about India is the rubbish which lines every street and roadside. It’s no different here and this beautiful river has its banks spoilt by litter. Next stop is a coffee research centre run by the government. I’m not a coffee drinker so it is strange to find out that coffee actually comes from a fruit. I had no idea! We head for lunch at Green Dreams, an
Photo of the day - Jefy posing
environmentally friendly farm retreat which is still trying to establish a reputation as a family resort which is sustainable in every way. They tents used as the accommodation are beautiful inside and this looks like a great place to come for a relaxing weekend away. The food we eat is organic too and cooked on traditional fire stoves.

In the afternoon we visit two coffee factories and some of the group get to taste the fresh coffee. It is a long process to create the coffee products. I had no idea about this. Visiting all of these factories really makes outthink about how the food products we consume make it to our plate and how many miles they have travelled in the process. We are all given some to take home as a gift.

Tonight we have given our third presentation to a Rotary Club and it goes well. We get some good feedback and many of the questions are aimed at Emily in the agriculture sector and Nicola in the food area. The club have made this a special event for us and they have brought their families along to enjoy a bonfire too. Rotary clubs here
Coffee factory
have a much younger average membership and they provide regular activities for the whole family. It’s all a bit much for little Jefy who is sound asleep!

City Palace Museum
Geo: 24.5823, 73.6882

We started our day with a walking trip to the City Palace Museum. It was a nice palace to walk through. After leaving the palace we were free until 7 pm when we attended a traditional dance performance. A group of us headed off to enjoy lunch and a real cappuccino. In India they serve a lot of Nescafé!
After our lunch we headed off with our Spanish friends and wandered through the narrow streets looking in shops and taking photos. After getting thoroughly lost and getting caught in a monsoon rain, we eventually hired a tuk-tuk driver to take us to a bridge near our hotel. We really enjoyed wandering through the streets of Udaipur. They were much cleaner and fewer cows.
In the evening we enjoyed a dance performance before heading out for dinner. Dinner was at a rooftop cafe. It was our last meal as a full group, as some friends will not be joining us back in Delhi. Just as we were finishing our meals the rain started, so everyone pulled out their umbrellas.

As we all got up early to go to the beach and paddle, we were all to chicken to swim! We had a typically English paddle, rolled up pants that always fall into the water. We looked at the beach huts and watched the jet ski's. Back to hosts for showers and breakfast and off to Moodabidri. Fantastic warm welcome, handshakes and flowers. We were taken to Soans pineapple farm where I had pineapple more tasty than ever before! A strange fruit called the miracle fruit that turns everything you eat after it sweet tasting, must take some home!! The timber yard was amaxing, the carving at inlays just beautiful, if I could have carried a door on my back I'd have bought one! We were given fantastic areca nut garlands which will be kept forever in my house. The medicinal herb garden was really interesting and the fermentation room smelled like beer and christmas cake!
The hospitality was heart warming and I look forward to seeing them again at the end of January!
I had a city tour last night and saw some places not quite on the map for tourists, I loved the mixture of the old parts sitting in between huge apartment blocks, there is so much to see in this city it would take weeks to see half I think! I was taken to get Mendhi on my hands, it took 10minutes and looks beautiful! The guys that did it should go into cake decorating, the speed they piped such intricate designs-wow!
Anyway, it's time for breakfast and another day out. Oh yes, Happy Birthday for yesterday again Dad x x

Ram in his office at the tile factory
10 January 2013

The traditional industries of Mangalore are clay tiles, cashew nuts and beady (not sure if that’s the correct spelling!) which we are told is a form of cigarette, rolled in a leaf. Apparently many of the men in the families used to spend their weekly wages on alcohol so the woman would roll beady at home to sell and support the family while she cared for the children. Today we are visiting a tile factory and cashew factory to learn more about them.

Ramkrishna has been looking after us for the past few days and we visit his family tile factory, UMA Tile Company, which opened in 1947. Ram used to work here when he was younger during his school holidays. He knows the business inside out and runs it now with his father. The first tile factory in Mangalore was opened in 1930 by the missionaries. Mangalore has much lighter clay which is used for roof tiles and building blocks. At one point there were 60 factories here but now there are just seven left. Tiled roofs are much less popular now as blocks of apartments with flat roofs are popping up all over the
UMA Tile Company
city. Ram has 30 products and his main market is in Mumbai and Bangalore and he mainly deals with direct customers and end users. Each tile is worth about 15 rupees (not much) and tiling the roof of a large house would cost around £300! The factory is impressive and I still can’t believe that we can come into these places and look around without any worried about health and safety. We even stand on top of the kiln and look down into it! The process is good to watch and one member of staff taps and looks at each and every tile to mark it into one of 11 classes. How he manages this I have no idea. They all sound the same to me! Poor quality tiles won’t pass the test as they will crack when exposed during the hot sun and then the rainy season.

Randomly, Ram tell us that the workforce in India sometimes choose not to turn up to work. All of his staff have to be trained in every area of the factory so that it can still operate when staff fail to show up. It seems that this is common and at
Working the kiln
the Cashew factory, owner Prakash tell us the same thing. He employs 225 people but on any normal day, around 200 will turn up for work. Employment law here always works in favour of the employee so this is acceptable it seems!

Cashews came to India from Brazil when the Portuguese wanted to test the quality of the soil. Not so long ago, the nut industry was struggling as people were worried about the fat content of cashews. Now, people are realising the benefit of snacking on them. Before the trip, I didn’t really like cashews but I have to admit that I’m a convert. We tasted around four flavours here, including honey, roasted and black pepper and they are all fab. I have lots to bring home!

Again, the process is amazing to watch and although the factory is modernising and new machinery is visible in every department, most of the work is still done manually. One cashew only has a 22% yield but the shell is never wasted and the oil is extracted to be used as fuel, which Ram uses in his tile factory. It is a seven day process from cooking the nuts to
Cashew factory
packaging and distributing. Again, nothing is wasted as the broken nuts are used in food and sweet products. Prakash sells his products mainly to Indian markets and the Japanese as they like quality rather than quantity. His business is booming but labour costs are increasing quickly and competition is rife in Vietnam and in India too. In the state of Karnataka alone there are 400 cashew factories.

After lunch, where we see a tattooed man (very rare to see here) and hear some English music, (old, but still, it’s music!) we head to an artisan village where we see people making traditional items using a hand loom, a pottery wheel and bamboo. It’s also a chance to buy some traditional gifts! I buy Dev and Rahul some traditional wooden toys which are good for hand eye coordination, so maybe I’m supporting the Indian cricket team of the future!

Back at home (it feels like home!) Punit and Rupal take me out to their favourite drive in restaurant. It’s strange to see people with cups and saucers in their car rather than disposable coffee cups. They are right though, the food here is delicious. Can’t believe it’s my last
Traditional skills
night with them here in Mangalore. It’s a lovely modern and vibrant city and I really like it. We have our second Rotary meeting tonight and we deliver our presentation which is received well. We also get a chance to meet two of the Indian GSE team who are travelling to Cumbria and Lancashire in April/May. They are both lovely and we offer them some advice about the weather! One man also approached me and Di to tell us that his brother works in the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle and he has been there for 30 years. Amazing!

Punit takes me for one final drive around town on the way home and we discuss the city, the fact that I am learning my way around already, and we have a discussion about the differences between Muslims and Hindus. I think that most people at home in the UK don’t understand the difference and associate all Asians with the worst side of the Muslim religion we read about in the press. Punit shows me his old family home which is now surrounded by towering apartment blocks. However, it seems that the house has also been sold for development land and
Hard labour
it is in the process of being demolished.

Pineapple juice bar
Didn’t think I could top the brownie last night but today Rupal gave me some of her aunts home made mint chocolates and then made her own brownie for desert tonight! Yum!

Our schedule today said that we were heading to a Jain temple at Moodabidri but the unexpected (or now expected!) happened again and we landed at a Rotary meeting in the town. The people welcomed us warmly with flowers and then told us the plan for the day; a pineapple farm, a wood factory, lunch and then a herbal medicine centre.

The pineapple farm has a long history and the family owners also grow lots of other plants and fruits on their land, as well as having a beautiful guest house. Farmers here really have to think of innovative ways to use their land and make the most of their crops as it is so dry most of the year but the land floods in the monsoon season. At the juice bar, we taste some fresh pineapple juice before having a tour of the site. It is so interesting to learn about where our food comes from! Eating the fresh fruit is an even better experience. It
Lunch
tastes so much better than our own.

We arrive at the wood factory and the company and house are owned by Rotarians. I have never seen so much beautiful wood in one home! We are invited in and given a garland of varnished nuts. We also make presentations to each of the Rotary members who are here. And there are a lot. After entertaining us with some Tulu songs, we are asked to entertain them. We haven’t prepared anything but Emily and Di come to the rescue with a cobbled together version of the Highland Fling. Di also has a go at playing a local flute! Go girls!!

Lunch is amazing and followed by more fruits than I have ever seen in one place. The highlight of my day here is watching the craftsmen at work in the factory. It’s great to see how an item starts and then the end product, all in one place. The attention to detail is amazing and these men are very skilled workers. Some of the pieces we see take around two months to complete and include brass and pearl inlays. I think we are all considering shipping some items home!
Workers carving the wood

Next stop is the Jain temple of 1000 pillars. Again the granite carvings are amazing and have stood here for hundreds of years. It is amazing to think about the history behind these places of worship. Last stop is the herbal medicine factory. The products here are natural and we see the fermentation process as well as the machines used to turn the medicines into tablet form. Many of the items here look like the type of things we buy in Holland and Barrett.

It has been a long day and I head home, back to my host family in Mangalore. Rupal and Punit spend some time explaining the area where they pray in their home. They talk about the various idols which they pray to and tell me that their religion has 30,000 different gods. No wonder I can’t get my head around it. They all pray here every day and ring a bell within the house too. Later, I spend some time outside trying to play cricket with the boys. I think its safe to say im not very good but the boys do try not to laugh at me! They learn cricket at school and Dev
Bat it like Botham
is particularly good. After a run around the town in the car and some snacks at a drive thru, we eat dinner and then I spend some time with the boys, who call me auntie. They tell me that they have eaten and thoroughly enjoyed the first stick of Blackpool Rock. I use Google images and maps to show them my house, my street, some of the sights in London and also tell them all about snow. They are fascinated. I hope I have made two pen friends here too!

Me and Dr. Ravichandran
8 January 2013

I’m learning lots about life in India, including the frequent power cuts. We have another while I’m in the shower this morning! The family are keen to learn lots about like in the UK too including jobs, the recession, minimum wage, cost of living, lifestyle, hobbies and family circumstances. Much of this is very new to them. The economy in India is booming and people here are not worried about jobs. From what people are telling me, the Government here don’t seem to be supporting some of the things you would think they would, like rubbish collection. The Government used to collect road tax annually but now ask for 15 years worth in one go to help fund projects. It is ironic really because on our travels we have seen countless half built bridges and road works which have been abandoned due to lack of funding.

The driving here leaves a lot to be desired! Apparently anybody can pass a test and there is not any real system of learning to drive. That is quite clear. It also seems to be ok to drive without a seatbelt and while using a mobile. We have almost killed
Shopping Mall
a dog already and have also been sat in the middle of a road tooting at a car opposite, both refusing to move! Yet, the only police I have seen are traffic coordinators. They can’t be doing a very good job!

On the way to the vocational visits, Punit shows me the local railway station. Its packed with commuters and school children. There are also a lot of people walking on the tracks and he tells me that they use it almost as a pavement. We pass the tax office and the newly renovated and very White House like council buildings. Despite paying 30% tax to the Government, the workers in India are yet to see much return. Most have private healthcare and pay privately for their schools. The Government are seen as corrupt and if too many people are too well educated, they might start to ask questions about where their money is being spent. Punit’s sons had to sit an entrance exam to attend their school, and as well as making a donation, fees must be paid. Parents do this willingly as education in India is one of the most important things for families.

Punit owns
The lovely Rupal and Punit
a plywood factory with his dad, a 67 year old who is yet to retire! They employ around 20 people from northern India as many people in Mangalore will not take manual labour jobs. It is very much an educated city and people work for banks or IT companies. Punit pays his staff well and provides accommodation for them. Most of them choose to work more than the usual eight hours so that they can make money to send home or support their families who have moved here with them.

Today I visited three companies based in Mangalore with Punit. The first is Diya Systems, a subsidiary of Glowtouch. They provide software solutions including, including application development and web hosting, to companies across the world. They have 980 staff, including 60 in Kentucky in the US. I love the story behind third company. And despite its humble roots and family values, it is an impressive building with fingerprint recognition for staff and a hotel attached to it for international clients. Dr Ravichandran says that the company started with just three people and one computer. Now, just over a decade on, they have more than four million customers. Dr Ravichandran
Yum.....
is a philanthropist and the whole ethos of the business is the support the community. He spends 40% of his own time and more than 100,000 rupees (£1000) each month on community investment. He employs local people and recruits local graduates for the specialist roles. He trains them and offers them accommodation, transport and a free canteen. There are incentives linked to service and quality and staff are recognised for their achievements. They communicate in a variety of ways and have an open floor. I am really impressed by his values and they fact that he is leading his staff in the same direction, including them in his projects. He even has the beginnings of a CSR report which is great to read. As well as employing disabled people, he also provides education for the children of his own personal staff. Dr Ravichandran tells me that he learned these values from his grandmother and he is passing them on to his own four grandchildren.

We also visit Flexiresources, a software development company, and Magnum, an advertising agency, both of which are local businesses performing fantastically in international markets. The graduates here are enthusiastic, positive and eager to explain the projects they are working on. I have found that while the standard communication methods are lacking, they make up for it by emphasising face to face communication. There are also lots of incentives for people to do well here and improve performance and output. These businesses tell me that they have not really been affected by the recession in the west as big companies still need their services to stay up to date with technology.

I am interested to read on the front of the Times of India that a spiritual leader has caused controversy here by claiming that the Delhi rape victim could have prevented the attack by holding the hands of the accused and calling them her brothers, asking them to stop. Much of India will be outraged by this claim, as the newspaper explains.

Punit drops me off at a local clinic and my time here could be described as fairly traumatic! Everything from my first experience with an Indian toilet (I have done well to avoid it for a week!) and then the ayuverdic massage I receive. I will keep this one for my personal diary! The shopping with Rupal afterwards makes up for this and I spend what seems like a fortune (but is actually next to nothing) on 100% silk scarves, bracelets, trinket boxes and other bits and pieces. Malls are popping up here all the time and are packed with fashionable clothes stores, bowling alleys and cinemas. Rupal is good at bartering the prices down for me. Rupal also gives me some traditional Indian earrings, a beautiful bracelet and some local cashew nuts. What a lovely family they are. I hope they like the delicacies I gave them; Kendal mint cake and Blackpool rock!

Tonight, we headed out to a local restaurant with the rest of the team and their hosts. I try lots of different dishes and even manage to sneak in some wine and an amazing chocolate brownie. Yum! I can’t believe that I was worried about what I would eat. I could get used to this cuisine!

View of Mangalore
7 January 2012

Before anybody mentions the spelling and punctuation, we are writing so much in the short time that we have, we don't always have time to proof read. Sorry!



After an epic breakfast with Mithra (about seven courses of Indian food, including two sweet courses!) we are sent off on the bus back to Mangalore. It is an emotional farewell and as soon as Emily starts crying, me and Nicola follow! I hope this shows our hosts how much we have appreciated their hospitality. They have looked after us so well that I have already told my mum I want to stay here! To thank Mithra, I gave her some Kendal Mint Cake, a Cumbrian slate coaster and a postcard of Ullswater. I also left a letter and some Blackpool Rock for Geethra, my ten your old friend, in the hope that she will write to me. Mithra gave me a beautiful candle made in Udupi and a book about acupressure, something she is very enthusiastic about. And if I can look that good at 73, I will be too. I might even take up her early morning yoga habit! Mithra has asked me to
A temple for every caste
come back for a honeymoon one day and I hope that I will see her again.

In Mangalore, we are taken on a tour of the city. First stop, a Church, hand painted inside by one man. It took him two years and five months to complete and the attention to detail is stunning. Unfortunately we can’t take any photos in most of the religious places here so you just have to take my word for it. We are then taken up endless flights of stairs to the top of the tower of the adjoining school. The winding and wobbly stairs are worth the panic as we see panoramic sights of Mangalore. It really is a beautiful city. We take in the ship building yard, hospitals, busy streets, apartment blocks, and even some very dodgy health and safety on a nearby building site!

We go onwards to two temples. Here, we have to sip holy water, have a powder applied to our heads and contemplate the rituals before walking out backwards. Many people come here each day to worship. Some believe that one of the shrines will boost fertility and we see women praying there. The second temple
Beautiful
is busier and brighter. It was built by a lower caste to offer an opportunity for everybody to worship. In the past, only higher castes of society were allowed to enter some temples. At the temple, children swarm round us, asking where we are from. They want to have their photo taken with us and then see it on the screen. These are not poor children. They wear nice school uniforms and are from middle class families. However, this area does not see many western tourists and they are fascinated by us and our pale skin. It feels strange to be the minority for once. Some of the children follow me into the temple asking for English coins. None of us have any but they are happy with the Rotary pens I give them. An older lady also asks us for English coins for her collection.

After lunch with Devdas and his family, we head to a school for children with disabilities. The school does not receive any Government funding and they are hoping that Rotary International will help to fund a new school bus for them. There are 90 children here of different ages. Some board here but
Angie swarmed by children
others travel miles to come and the current school bus is insufficient. The children are amazing and welcome us with music and garlands of flowers. We also have a bindi applied and a flame ritual is carried out by the school prefect. Inside the classrooms we are met with happy and well behaved students. Each class has no more than eight students and they are each involved in different activities. In one of the classrooms I am moved to tears by a girl, no more than six years old, as she greets the principal of the school. It is clear to see that these children are well cared for and are learning new and useful skills here. The money which Rotary could donate would perhaps be a small amount at home, but here, it really could achieve a great deal.

My second host comes to pick me up and take me to his family apartment in a nice residential area of Mangalore. Punit is married to Rupal and they have two children. Dev is 12 and Rahul is ten. They have a lovely home and welcome me with yet more Indian hospitality! This will be my home for the
A welcome party at the special school
next four nights and I’m keen to get to know the family. They tell me that they married 16 years ago. It was an arranged marriage and they met one year before the wedding. Rupal moved from Bombay to be with Punit and his parents, who live in a separate apartment in the same block. The children go to a nice co-ed school and take part in lots of extracurricular activities. They also love cricket! I get them on side by mentioning that I know that India beat Pakistan last night. (Mitra and Mr Shetty made a lot of noise during the game!)

Punit and Rupal take me to see a nearby Church which is more than 300 years old. There is a wedding taking place and Punit explains that his brother married a Christian girl from India and they had a wedding which celebrated both of their faiths. The day started with a Hindu wedding like we have seen this week, and ended with a Christian service in this very Church.

We go on to see the old port and I ask them to show me the local fire station too. This is partly because I am
In the classroom
interested in these things and partly to impress my dad, a former fire-fighter at home. There are about five machines here to cover the Managlore district of 600,000 people. At any time, there are 15 men working in the station and each machine needs a team of seven. They work twelve hour shifts here for 15 days at a time. They let us come inside the new and very modern building and explain that when somebody dials 101, it comes directly to the station. They ring a bell on the wall only once (They show me how this works!) and the fire-fighters can be in the machines and on the road in 50 seconds. I am surprised that they have to dress in their full uniform, minus the boots, as soon as their shift starts and ready to respond at any minute. Surely this must be hot and heavy? But it all makes sense when I see their uniform....a brown shirt and brown trousers. Not exactly safety gear! There are very few fires in Managlore and sometimes they sit and wait days before a call out. On the way home, we stop off for some coconut milk. Once the coconut
Happy children
is dry of milk, it is split open and the inside is offered to me. I willingly eat it when Rupal explains that it is good for your complexion!

Beautiful flowers
6 January 2012

We are quickly learning that plans seem to change as quickly as they are made. Today, we thought we were going to visit some temples. Instead we landed at a Rotary Club meeting about 15km from Udupi in Brahmavar where we received yet more beautiful flowers and were asked to talk about ourselves. The English here is different and it is quite difficult to understand what people are saying. I do understand when they take us downstairs to the cake shop and ask us to pick anything. Unfortunately it’s a case of ‘can’t eat, won’t eat’. Nicola can’t eat cakes, and I was advised to avoid anything from street caterers. It takes all my willpower to say no!! We are taken to a research farm, part of Bangalore University. The presentation and tour are great but my highlight is the cocoa beans. Our Brahmavar hosts choose to call me Chocolate Girl after this! The temples, one Jain, one Buddhist, are very interesting. It would be good to know a little more about the background though. Most of the signs are not in English.

While on the bus with our hosts, they are asking us about our
Mmmmmmm.....
personal circumstances and are amazed to hear that I don’t live my parents and I am unmarried. I explain my family situation and they say that we should all be living together, including my mum, dad, brother and other brother with his wife and two children! They continue to question me about it and find the situation hilarious! They even ask if perhaps my Dad will find me a husband? I hope not! This does start to worry me when they take us to our second wedding of the trip and I’m a bit concerned that it’s actually going to be my wedding. Tomorrow I’m wearing a ring!

At the wedding I come across my first Indian style toilet. I think I have done well to avoid even seeing one properly for four days! Although it’s clean, I decided to wait. Emily took the initiative to check the other toilets and we find two western ones beside the four Indian style loos!

We have some free time with our hosts and Mr Shetty takes me and Mithra out. I should have been staying with Mr Shetty and his family but due to a death in the family, my
Chocolate girl!
host was changed to Mithra. We go on a rustic boat ride down the river which is fantastic. Very peaceful and serene. We then head to Udupi beach where families have gathered to watch the sunset. It’s like no beach I have been on before. Most beaches are either crowded with tourists or deserted. This is simply hundreds of locals from inland who come to fly kites and splash in the waves. There are camel rides, tight rope walkers, Muslim women in veils and also Indian men holding hands, a sight which is becoming more common to me!

It has been a fantastic final day here and I really love Manipal and Udupi, the people, the cuisine, the sights and the university town atmosphere. I have become very close to Mithra already and she has told me lots about her family, her life here in India, her arranged marriage and her interests. She has been an excellent host and I have loved sharing her beautiful home. I’m going to be really sad to leave tomorrow.

Community Radio
5 January 2013

So many things happen each day that it is hard to keep track of them all and write them in the blog, especially when we don’t have wifi to keep updating it! If anybody wants a real and honest account they will have to ask to read my personal diary when I get home!

Today has mainly consisted of food and learning.

The Indian people are so friendly and hospitable that they insist on feeding us, a lot of food, all of the time. Much more than we are used to, including breads and potatoes for breakfast! We have all agreed that although the food is lovely, unless we start to say no, we will all come back much heavier than when we arrived.

I was lucky enough to visit the Manipal Institute of Communication today where I learned about the courses, the students and how they are recruited, how journalism and communication works in India, recent changes and a social uprising being started by the youth via social media. I am told that this is especially common now that people are talking about the recent gang rape in Delhi. The younger generation of
Manipal University
Indians want a voice now, more so than ever. I also learn about how the university interacts with the community and discover that staff here have the same communication issues as we do at our UK universities. I meet a 91 year old professor who still comes to work every day! I hope I’m not working at 91. He is somewhat of a celebrity in Southern India as he has been a reporter and editor for some of the biggest newspapers. I also find that some people disagree with page 3 of Indian newspapers. I curiously ask what page 3 is and I am told that it is gossip and celebrity news, with some women wearing revealing clothes. If only they could see our version of page 3!

The printing press in Manipal is very impress and gets work from across the world, including Penguin and Pearson. JK Rowling’s book, Casual Vacancy, was recently printed here and the Hindu version of ‘The Secret’ is currently on the press. There are also school book, calendars, leaflets and the most recent copies of Indian Vogue and GQ. The factory is run well and I am very impressed. Although, I doubt that
Dancing at Asare Centre
I would be allowed to do this in the UK without ear plugs and a hard hat!

In the afternoon we all met up to visit the Manipal University’s main campus and watch the virtual tour. It is impressive but starts to feel a little bit like propaganda. The university is one of the top five in India and they are keen to instil pride in the students. We also meet the Pro Chancellor who gives us all a rose. I have had more flowers this week than ever before. We then travelled up to End Point, a beautiful hill overlooking the city of Udupi. It was nice just to get some sunshine, the first we have been able to enjoy outside! We seem to be spending a lot of time indoors and travelling.

The Astare Centre is a home for people with disabilities and it is an eye opener. The people here are treated very well and the centre is clean and tidy. Everybody welcomes us with more artificial flowers which are made by the residents to help them develop their life skills. The centre is funded by the university and Rotary.

Tonight we also delivered our first presentation to two rotary clubs. It went well and was received well. We were given lots of gifts and we are all wondering how we will get everything home!

Angie signing the register at Asare School
Just to prove we haven't hidden Angie in a cupboard somewhere here are a few photos of her taken today at the Asare School. We have all been looking after each other, but we won't let Angie be in charge of the presentation clicker again!!! 😊

Asare School is for mentally challenged people and is sponsored heavily by the Rotary Club in Manipal and was set up as a joint initiative with Manipal University.

Children and young adults live here permanently and have lessons and recreation time together. They also make synthetic roses and plates to sell and raise money for the school. The vocational training offered allows some people to go on and lead independant lives and find a job.

It was originally set up by Jai Vittal - Estate Manager at Manipal University and named after his daughter who attends the school. He showed us round today and we met his wife who is a teacher at the school and his youngest son who is in the final year of his degree in Computer Science.

Rtn. Karunakar Shetty
As ever here in India there has been LOTs of food and I managed to have 5 meals today!!! My stomach is ready to burst!!! I had a very large breakfast this morning which consisted of:

- bowl of cereal
- 2 dosas (pancakes) with coconut chutney
- 1 omlette
- 2 slices of toast
- glass of lyche juice
- cup of tea

Normally I don't have time for any breakfast back in the UK so this is a lot of food for me and could last me all day!

Today we started our vocational visits and Rtn. Shetty picked me up at 8.15am (early rise for me on a Saturday!!!) and took me to visit Kajane Agricultural Farm. I met Natraj Hegde who is a very forward thinking 2nd generation farmer/businessman who grows coconuts, cashew nuts, rubber, mangosteen, rambutan and peppers. He is experimenting with multiple cropping systems to get maximum yield from his crops and efficient use of water and land. Although we can't grow such exotic crops here in the UK the concept is something many UK farmers could adapt.

After walking round the plantations (which even at 9am this morning were approaching
Areca nut tree on Kajane Farm
35 degrees!!!) we sat in the shade and I drank fresh coconut water straight from the shell with a straw. It was very refreshing and afterwards they cut open the shell and I ate the soft creamy inside flesh -delicious!!! Natraj also has a successful online business called Vanilla Mart , based in Tumbridge Wells, Kent selling vanilla products to UK and European markets.

Lots of photos were taken on the farm of me with my hosts and this was just the beginning of the photograpgy!!!

Rtn. Shetty then took me to a local tile factory that is run by a close family friend as unfortunately the visit to the AMPC weekly market and office was unable to happen today. I met the mother of the family in their house and even though her English was non-existant she was very kind and welcoming to me, with lots of hugs and hand holding. It was here my 2nd meal of the day appeared in the form of more dosas with a sweet filling known as Chana Dal witha side order of freshly roasted cashnew nuts and chilli tikki banana chips. The very kind lady then gave me a packet of
Mangosteen and Rambutan products
Don't think we can buy these in the UK - very exotic fruits.
the dosas and banana chips to take away with me!

Next we were supposed to go straight back to the hotel in Manipal to meet everyone for lunch, but Rtn. Shetty wanted to show me his house and let my try some of his special fried fish (meal 3). It was absolutely delicious and just the right ammount of spice, but did make us cough a lot in the kitchen as he was cooking it! Apparently his wife makes fun of him and says he only likes people who like fish! I guess I am in the good books then!!! I ate 2 pieces and tried desperately not to think of lunch a mere 10 minutes away!!! Rtn. Shetty is a retired banker in his 60's who teaches English part time at a school in his home town that educates poorer children. He also goes swimming every morning VERY early is a member of a Laughter Club - I really like the sounds of this concept and think we could use some of these clubs back in the UK!!!

Lunch (meal 4) at the hotel with all the GSE team and their hosts was again delicious, but I
Tile factory
think we were all strugging with the sheer volume of food. We did of course manage mains, seconds and even pudding with some ""gentle"" persuasion from our hosts! Afterwards we headed on a tour of Manipal University which was VERY impressive - a very different place to any of our UK univerisities and I got the impression that students were more committed to their studies and appeciated the opportunities available to them following graduation.

A very busy man called Jai Vittal showed us rounf the campus and he was always trying to make us hurry up and move on, but we were all taking lots of photos!!! He even introduced us to the Pro Chancellor - Dr Ballal - who is second in command under Dr Ramdas Pai who is the son of the original university founder Dr PMA Pai and had a significant influence of the development of Udupi and Manipal in general.

We didn't have long to get changed before heading out to our first Rotary Club meeting in India which was a joint event between Udupi and Manipal clubs. We were all very nervous about delivering our presentation for the first time to an audience of nearly 100 people. The difference for us was the outdoor venue with bright stage lights and l lots of mosquitos!!! We got all the technology working (Eventually!!!) and delivered without any hitches. We got presented with several roses from the hosting clubs and we also exchanged banners. Lots more photos were taken including group photos for each club with all members on the stage. We then ate dinner in the same place and was a wonderful buffet which again went down only using the right hand to eat. Meal number 5 of the day done and definitely no more room today!!!!

Onwards now to bed for me I am afraid as it's not after midnight and I must be at breakfast tomorrow for 8.30am.

Fatehpur Sikri
Geo: 26.8711, 75.8351

After a 1 hour drive from Agra we arrived at Fatepur Sikri for our first tour of the day. We toured the fort and mosque. It was interesting and well preserved. We wore little plastic beanies when we went into the beautiful white marble mosque. We then wandered through the local shops and streets. That is always quite an eye opener! We enjoyed a local Thali meal on a roof top terrace over looking the town. We could see locals cooking and doing laundry on their roof tops. We love watching the everyday street life. There are always cows, bulls, dogs, donkeys, horses and camels wandering free thru the streets.
Every where we wander when entering local sites we are swarmed by hawkers. We are getting very good at ignoring them. They are not as bad as what we experienced in Egypt.
Another 4 hours drive took us to Jaipur. Once arriving in Jaipur we got changed to go to a Bollywood theatre. The theatre itself was quite a spectacle. We absolutely loved the experience but could not figure out what the story line really was about. It was full of action and car chases, singing and dancing. Throughout the film
Knees must be covered in Mosque
there was some English mixed in with lots of Hindi. Just being in the atmosphere of the theatre was an experience of its own. Leaving the theatre after 2 1/2 hours we experienced our own thrilling ride home on a tuk tuk! It was like being on bumper cars.
We ate a late dinner and then headed to bed exhausted!

The wedding
4 January 2013

So much has happened today that it’s hard to know where to start! I was woken up by a mixture if dogs barking, train going over the bridge and chanting or praying from a nearby home. We experienced Indian time when the plans and timings changed, something which is common here but makes everything feel laid back and relaxed.

We have a bus to use for the duration of the trip and our driver Nagaraj is to take us into the city of Mangalore. As we are driving in, we are able to see lots of things we missed yesterday. It is amazing that there is so much wealth and poverty living side by side. I have seen wealth before and I have seen poverty before, but never both so close together without anybody batting an eyelid. One minute we have cows and goats grazing by the roadside, small fires and people looking through rubbish, then we have expensive advertising, shopping malls and people immaculately dressed n bright and expensive clothes. Everything is very loud and the main noise is car horns tooting and the whistles of road police and parking attendants.

We arrive at
Wedding meal
the venue for our first Indian wedding! The father of the bride is a Rotarian and his 24 year old daughter is marrying a 27 year old man. Although arranged marriages still happen, they are less common and Rathi and Rajesh met through work and they are marrying for love. Both have university qualifications and will work once they are married. Rotarian Sathish and his wife Sapna talk us through the ceremony and answer our questions. It was interesting to learn that the groom changes the name of the bride to match the same letter as his first name. In todays case, both names began with ‘R’ but Sapna was called Tara before she married Sathish. They also have children, a son of 20 and a married daughter of 26 with the same initial. Sathish and Sapna had an arranged marriage, with suitable partners picked by their horoscopes.

The wedding ceremonies here last for days, with lots of celebrations and rituals include burning, henna, (more common in North India) washing feet, giving beads and hundreds of thousands of flowers, used as venue decoration but also as a garland for the couple and in the brides hair. We learn that
Wedding car
best man must be younger than the groom and we are told that if there are two boys or two girls in a family, the younger cannot marry until the older has. Similarly, the sons must wait until the daughters are married before they can marry, unless there is an age difference of more than five years. They also tell me that there are far fewer women in India and for every 200 men, there are just over 130 women, meaning that many young men can’t find a wife. The maternal uncles deliver the bride to her groom and she is paraded to the guests, and lifted towards him before a blanket is removed to reveal her. I feel very emotional watching this and the loud music and smells sweep you away.

Everybody must have a full stomach to wish the couple well and we are shocked to see just how many people are being fed. There are around 1000 guests and while some quickly eat at the buffet outside, many are sitting down in a canteen. Here, we are given a banana leaf to use as a plate, as well as around ten small meals, eaten with our
Udupi Temple
hands. We are also given a box of Cadbury sweets, some I have never seen before, with a sticker noting the name and date f the wedding. (Apparently the bride’s father is a distributor for Cadbury!)

All of the guests who are invited will turn up for just part of the ceremony as it lasts so long and takes place on various days of the week. Many people go to around 30 weddings per year but they are asked not to bring any gifts as their presence is enough. Also, if the couple are given gifts, they must note what they were given and then in the future return something worth more. This could end up a bit pricy I think! What has hit me most is the fact that people in India are celebrating their marriage with so many people, making family and friends the most important part of their day. At home, this isn’t always the case and more and more people put on a show but forget the real meaning of their marriage.

Our GSE organiser in India, Devdas Kamath, invites us to his home and tells us that he and his wife had an arranged marriage and married two months after they met. His mother and father have been married for 52 years. They met on the day of their wedding! Devdas and his wife show us their wedding album from 19 years ago which is similar to the wedding we seen today.

We then travelled about an hour north to Manipal and Udupi where we met our first hosts. We were all greeted by female Rotarians, mine a 73 year old lady called Mithra Bhandarkar. Mithra has two children, her son living in California and her daughter living in Mumbai, and four grandchildren. Mithra has lived alone since she was widowed seven years ago. Her husband was ten years older than her and she tells me that when she had her arranged marriage, this was normal. Now women have a partner just four or five years older. Mithra’s house is beautiful and sits back from a main road through secure gates. The home was her husband’s dream home as he grew up in a house with just two rooms. The house features an indoor fountain as well as indoor and outdoor balconies. Mithra now just uses the ground floor so I have the top floor to myself! She also has staff, a young woman aged 27 who lives in quarters below the main house with her husband, a construction worker, and four year old son. He is delighted to see a foreigner! Mithras helper only works in the mornings to clean and wash. Her own mother worked for Mithra for more than 20 years and Mithra greets the little boy like he is one of her grandchildren which was very nice to see. She also tells me that she had a driver for 22 years but she sacked him two years ago because he was stealing from her.

Mithra takes me to her ladies club, Manipal Mahila Samaj. She spends a lot of time between here and the rotary club and the hall where the meeting is held was named after her late husband. She also tells me that she is a donor to the rotary foundation and so far she has donated more than $60,000. During the meeting, Mithra unexpectedly grabs my hand and takes me up to the stage where I have to explain to all of the guests who I am and why I’m here! After introducing her friend Nandita, 42, they take me in the car. Although Mithra has said we might go some places, plans change quickly and they speak to each other in their own language so much of the time I am at their mercy, jumping in the car and wondering where we will arrive next!

They take me to see a car festival, which are basically floats or a parade. We are in Carstreet, ironically a street with no cars but eight small community temples and one large temple. Although I’m finding it hard to keep up with all of the religions and community names, I gather that each of the eight compete to take over the larger temple for two years. This celebration today happens twice a year and everybody crams inside to watch the rituals and catch a glimpse of the idol through a grate in the wall. He is decked in diamonds and there are candles everywhere. The bell ringing, chanting and praying is quite overwhelming and although I understand hardly any of what they tell me, it feels like a very spiritual place. After leaving the temple and visiting some shops selling many idols, I get a chance to see my first elephant. It dances for the people before blessing them!

We also bang into some friends of Nandita and Mithra and the children are fascinated by me. One of the children, Greetha, 10, is very intelligent and asks me what I think about the protests being made in Delhi and if I feel safe. I am shocked that she seems to know so much but she goes on to tell me how she feel about this and being a young female in India. Greetha is intrigued by my life in the UK and asks a lot of questions. She is sad to leave when we head back to Mithras. I have also spoken to a lady about family life in India and we discuss adoption and why it is not so common here. I have learned so much already!

Mangalore to Udupi


Dr Gowri in her office at Sonia Clinic
It's so hard to believe that just over 48 hours ago we hadn't left UK soil and hadn't met any Indian Rotarians!

Everyone we have met is SO friendly and it would be impossible to name them all. People are so genuine and friendly out here and go out of their way to make us welcome.

Today we experienced our first Indian wedding and if I had to describe it in one word it would be - colourful!!!! More photos to follow in other blogs as I very unhelpfully left my camera at Devdas Kamath's house in Mangalore!

We were taken in our personal minibus this afternoon to the district of Upupi where we are staying for 2 nights and met our first set of hosts - who are all female Rotarians, many of them doctors. This is the first night we've not been staying as a group and although we were all aprehensive at initialy parting it only took a few moment to be in the host home to feel welcome and part of the family.

My host is Dr Gowri who is a very respected padeatrician in Manipal and Nicola is staying with her sister (also a doctor, but specialising in gynaecology) Dr Girija. We were both taken round the hospital which their father founded - Sonia Clinic - and saw their offices and consulting rooms. We also met their 86 year old father who still lectures at the medical college and lives right next door to the hospital.

Both our hosts are members of a local Ladies Club which meets once a fortnight and we were lucky enough to be invited to their first meeting of 2013 and greeted once again with open arms and many ""Happy New Years"". We were fed (again!!!) and watched the new committee being sworn in for duty.

Men at work
Once I had arrived again and spent a day alone in the office, It began to sink in how much has happen the past 4 years...

Peace Child was my first step into the world alone, my first adventure, the time when I first realised what was possible.

I think sometimes in England we lose what is possible and just do what is expected.

I'm not sure if by escaping every January, I am running away, recharging my battery’s or discovering something new, I guess its a mixture of all three.

Sometimes I wonder what it all means, deep I know but with the Ego and the voice inside our heads it so difficult to just be, be present be in the moment, I think sometimes when I’m lost in my thoughts, tight chested and anxious “Breath, let go and remind yourself that this moment you are living right now is the only one you know you have for sure” Sometimes it releases a little pressure,sometimes it make me smile, but honestly, I can remember the only time I’ve even completely been in the moment, it was here in India on the 11th of February 2010, I
The lovely Emily
was in Kanukamuri, the southern tip off India, the meeting of three seas, the home Hindu's say of Devti the female spirit of Hinduism. I was sitting on a wall on the coast looking out to sea, unimportantly Matt was beside me... The wind was blowing on my face, its strength, wild and free... suddenly, somehow my mind complexity cleared all I could feel was my breath, then I began to cry, no emotion had cause the tears it was I think a trastion to letting go. That moment was by far the calmest most peaceful moment of my life.



Sometimes I think maybe I’m hedonist, constantly searching for a perfect; life, moment, partner, feeling, job, home, state of mind.



So after that first day of just being on Friday the ….. I returned to the boys home, the interns at the moment had organised a Christmas meal for them all, all together they our 70 boys in the home at the moment,I wasn’t sure if returning was a massively good idea, I mean my last experience had been a whirlwind of emotions, the treatment of the boys had been something I had really
Boys home
struggled with but for some reason I hoped my boys were still there... for me maybe? I feel its because I was worried if they weren’t there where would they be... the boy I was hoping for the most was J avid, a shy undeveloped 13year old we had shared moments and story’s without words. As we approached the building a strange feeling overwhelmed me, fear I think.



That morning we made decorations, paper garlands, then at 1 o'clock the food arrived. The boys were made to stand in line as we organised the massive pots of chicken curry, rice, dal, chapit and sweets. Usually they would only eat dal so the chicken was a real treat for them.

After handing out the final plate I entered the room in which they were eating. Sat in lines they all wait until the last boy had sat down, then they chanted, maybe like a pray of thanks, it was such a beautiful moment, and sound. We sat and shared a plate of the food.



Straight after lunch we left and headed to Bern’s the director of peace child, it was a surreal experience a
Boys home on my 23rd Birthday
difficult one to comprehend straight away, none of my boys were still they, a partly there is a new law that they need to be sent home or somewhere else before 3 months is up.

The end of 2012... It had been such a difficult year in some ways, but so amazing also! I love new years and the start of a fresh calendar. Well, I dislike the last minute party plans and people making a huge deal out of NYE but I think it is important to take a moment to reflect on the past year and what you have accomplished. I remember a piece of paper I wrote with my goals that stared at me every day. If you don't make any goals, you certainly won't reach them. I set absurdly ridiculously huge goals...and guess what? If I had that little piece of paper with me right now, I could draw a line through everything I wrote down. That being said, ok, yes I wanted to travel for a year. Here I am, siting beside rice paddies hear a monkey pounce on the roof while I'm drinking terrible instant coffee in the middle of India. Be cautious of what you wish for because what you get will most likely exceed your own expectations 😊

Enough of my self introspective... Once again, I've waited too long to write a blog. Picking up where I left off, I arrived in Agra where the Taj Mahal is. Wow oh wow! What an incredible building. Made of solid, white marble and all of the inlay designs are from other stones. And guess what...when you step inside, it smells like roses. I woke up for sunrise to take some pictures and to see it. I didn't really have much of a choice because I had to leave that afternoon so sunrise seemed the best option. There is just something so special to watch the light change and the day begin...and it is just a bonus I get to do that while looking at some of the most beautiful buildings/sites in the world. After such a peaceful morning, I was all ready to travel down south for Christmas. Good thing I was rested because the 28 hours of travel was some kind of stressful adventure!

So I go to leave and apparently, the rickshaw drivers are on ""strike""...come on! Basically just a way to ask 5x the price and get it. So I'm in this rickshaw and he pulls over and gets a little guy missing one of his eyeballs on a bike to get me the rest of the way to the train station. Ahh at this point, I knew it was going to be an interesting trip...

I arrive and my train is delayed 7 hours. Normally, I wouldn't care, it's India...delays and things going not according to plan are expected. Trouble with this particular train being delayed is that it was connecting me to another train which was taking me all the way to Mumbai. My 2nd train had been booked solid for weeks (I booked it first day in India) and at one moment the wait list was over 800 people. So, crap, I can't miss it. I asked about my delayed train and the response I received was ""just jump on a train passing through and keep walking from car to car to avoid the ticket collector"". I am up for that challenge but not that day. So I race outside the train station and got a taxi to get me to the connecting station. And here is something fun, when you tell a driver in India to go as fast as possible...they most certainly do! I think the guy had his horn and gas peddle pressed all the way down for 1 hour of the 1.5 it took to arrive. I get out of the car at 5:13...my train was supposed to leave at 5:15. I was running through the station, which is not that easy because people are laying on the ground etc. hah ok so needless to say, I found the platform and no joke, as soon as I walked up huffing and puffing, the train pulls up. I heave my bag on, jump on the nearest car and zoom, the train is gone. This particular train was not late (shocking) and it paused for 60 seconds at the station (which is also rare because normally they sit for a long time in each town). At this moment, all i could do was laugh with relief and pray I was on the right train.

It only got more interesting because I was in a car with 49 men and myself. As luck would have it, all the seats face forward but at the very end of the car they are opposite so you are sitting facing everyone...guess where my seat was? So not only do I have to squish between two strange men, I provided some sort of entertainment for all the men to look at for the next 17 hours. Sorry to elaborate on this story, maybe it is not that interesting but it is an experience I will never forget.

I arrived in mumbai and had contemplated going site seeing for a couple hours. But let me tell you, the 1 hour I was out on the street and getting to the airport...I think that city does not need to be on my list of places to explore. I will watch it in slumdog millionaire and be content.

Within 10 minutes of landing in Goa, it felt like all the stress of the past 3 weeks just melted away. The beaches are beautiful, no pollution, and only the occasional honking of horns. So relaxing! It was the first Christmas I spent away from family, snow and festivities. I can honestly say, I didn't miss it TOO much. I feel horrible saying that, because obviously I miss my family and friends but Christmas time has become so focused on gifts, food and it is so built up that it was such a beautiful feeling just sitting on the sand with nothing, and simply being grateful. It also helped being in such a cool place. I went out on a boat and saw dolphins. How awesome is that??!!

The south of India is much more relaxed and easier! That is a relief because I was so close to booking a ticket out of India. So close! But I am really thankful I didn't. I met a group of travelers and have been moving from town to town with them. This town I'm in (Hampi) is one of the top destinations in India and I now know why. It has a mix of natural beauty and ancient beautiful temples. Thousands of years ago, a volcano erupted spraying massive boulders over the valley. So you can just stroll through banana plantations and come across rocks the size of two storey buildings. It is a really chill place and no alcohol is allowed, which really tones down the crazy backpacker scene. The group of us went for a walk yesterday and jumped in the river and floated back into town. I wish I could paint the picture but there was not a soul around, just palm trees, rocks and the water (which I accidentally swallowed some...oops). I can understand now why people fall in love with India (after a very rocky beginning 😊

...........and here we are in Mangalore!?!

India is an amazing experience for the first time visitor - colourful and busy are the two words that immediately spring to mind. Along with all the beeping and cars on the wrong side of the road and stray cows we made it safely to the Mangalore Club where we are staying tonight. Air conditioned balcony rooms with fantastics views are a welcome sights after a 9 hour overnight flight!!!

We have lots of exciting experiences ahead of us over the next few days and hopefuly after a good nights sleep we will all be raring to go. We are all doing remarkably well on severe lack of sleep, but need to get our body clocks back to some normality soon!

Tomorrow we have been invited to attend a Hindu wedding in the city and witness the main part of the ceremony. There will be about 900 guests present, which is small for this part of the world. Normally weddings have over 1000 guests, which a far cry from the traditional church wedding in the UK. This is a surprise addition to our agenda
DSC_0038
and we're really excited to experience this part of Indian cullture. The wife of one of the Rotarians we met today will shaparone us at the wedding and explain/translate the ceremony for us which will be extremely useful.

Let's just hope we don't melt in the 32 degree forecasted temperature!!!

The food is a LOT spicer than any of us were expecting, but all of it is delicious and cooked from fresh. We are all learning to scoop up the food with our right hand (left hand for cleaning only!) which is a challenge for me as a lefty, using the chapati or naan bread. I think we will all increase our spice tolerance over the coming weeks and looking forward to trying the difference regional variations in dishes.

Well, the end of our first day here. I'm full of lovely food, what a fantastic way to start!
I've been given a new suitcase, Thank you very much again! I've also managed to break into Di's to rescue her computer.
If I can ignore the huge black spider that just ran in front of me, I might be able to get to my room to sleep!

The internal flight.....
After a very early start at Manchester, a short trip to Heathrow and five hours in Bangalore, we have arrived in Mangalore!

We were waved off this morning by District Governor David Simpson and his wife Janet, who both came to wave us goodbye. Despite some heavy suitcases and too much hand luggage, we all made it here in one piece. My nerves were nowhere near as bad as I thought they would be and I managed to say goodbye to everybody without any tears!

The first things that have stuck me are the amount of adverts in Bangalore airport for green and environmental initiatives. It seems naive but I didn’t consider that this would be a priority for people in India. Being in Bangalore still felt like being in an airport at home, except for the beautiful Indian jewellery in the duty free! I was also very surprised to see copies of Fifty Shades on sale within the airport, obviously Twitter has spread the word over here too.

We have all withdrawn some rupees, witnessed some sunshine (something we don’t see much of!) and also had our first experience of an Indian toilet. Nicola was first to
View from my room
The rail and road bridges to and from Mangalore
go and was shocked to open the toilet door at Bangalore airport to be faced by a small drain in the ground and a hose attached to the wall. Once she pushed the door further she did see the western toilet right beside the drain! I’m sure we will see worse during the next month! After crossing my fingers through a flight on a propeller plane, we have just been met at Mangalore airport by a large group of our hosts. They decorated us with a bindi each and a garland of fresh flowers.

We travelled to Mangalore Club hotel for a relaxing evening before the work starts. The hotel was occupied by the English and the names of the honorary secretaries since 1876 reflect this; Brown, Black, Morgan, Davies, Jackson........ We were all welcomed to the club with coconut juice fresh from the coconut but the lunch we enjoyed with the hosts from D.3180 was very spicy, and I had to keep remembering to use my right hand. It is certainly different!

The view from my room on the top floor is fantastic, not sure about the beehive though! We are going to spend tonight relaxing and catching up on sleep. We are all a bit excited as we have been invited to a traditional Indian wedding tomorrow. Around 1000 guests will attend a ceremony which will last throughout the day. I am looking forward to seeing Indian culture up close and personal and sharing in the couple’s special day.

The kind moustasted man with the newspaper sign with my name splet wrong probably made it a little easier last time, after 18hrs of travel, no sleep and an emerging sore thoat i was once again where i had stood almost 4 years ago, bewildered and praying not to be ripped off i threw on my pack and walked into the crowd of taxi men, my ill spoken Hindi and his inability to read made the location difficlut to get across and as the journey progressed i tried desperately to recognise something of the town i'd spent over a month in...
When i arrived at the peace child office i was once again greeted by Viji, a famalir face, she is the interns house mother she cooks, cleans and looks after you.
It was now 5am and without sleep and a qucik glace at Tamzin i flopped down on to the same wooden bed and prayed for sleep...
I woke at 12 to the sound of voices in the kitchen, Juile another intern and Sammy who works full time for Peace Child were having there lunch inbetween teaching at two local primary schools.
Tamzin and the other intern Emily were at the boys home and wouldn't be back until 6.30pm.
Half asleep i tired to strick up conversation but as i began to realise how much things had changed, my thought wandered and i kept myself to myself...
While i waited locked into the office i lay in bed listening to the sounds, breathing in the smells and feeling the heat, it was only a few weeks before that i was stood in a marque in Emmbankment Gardens on the South Bank planning a party for 1700, full face of make up and a smart black suit, yet here i was laying on a plank of wood in baggy green silk throues and a purple salwa.

People have asked me over and over again ""Why are you doing this documentary Loretta?"" After all, you already have a non profit that does this work and you're about to start your masters degree, you're coaching clients and have a little startup. Is it really worth it?! How is this documentary really going to impact in the world?

After being here in India I can tell you exactly why we are doing this and why it's so important.

If you haven't seen it yet (in the past couple posts from this trip) we are uncovering some beautiful gems who are going to be the fortune we need for a brighter future. They are girls and young women who are strong and making a change in the world. They are young women who are ready to make change. They are girls who are ready to shine and ready to dust off the debrie of systemic pressures and old belief systems that result in child marriage, sexual violations, misconceptions and views that females are a curse not a blessing. They are ready to fight for their freedom. They are ready to share their voice with the world.

If you've
O07A0972
been watching the news you might have seen that we've been in India at a time where girls and women's rights are being rallied for after a young woman was raped on a moving bus and thrown out the doors in New Delhi. There have been rallies across India to press the govenment for change. Unfortunately that 23 yr old girl died today. This has to stop.

In the last 12 days here in Bangalore, we've worked with 20 girls, ages 11-18. Girls who's safety challenges are no different than that young woman on that bus. In their slum alone women are trafficked and assaulted daily. At least one woman a month dies or is killed. Almost all go unreported because they are female. The girl child is the most vulnerable.

We've feel privileged to have provided these girls with leadership training skills and asked them questions that have challenged some norms. We've talked about safety, body development, communication, and carrying themselves with confidence. We've learnt about their dreams and their values. We've danced with them, we've made art with them, we've sang with them, eaten with them, laughed with them, and today shared some sad good byes.
O07A1575


We've been invited in homes. We've interviews girls, boys, women and men about their lives, their views, and their opinions about equality. We've heard some extremely sad stories and some very powerful ones. We've cried while filming. We've tried really hard not to laugh while filming (apparently I'm not a great sound technician cause I can't keep quiet).

We, as a team, have had some really interesting and intense conversations. We've been able to provide 25 girls with a Pads4Girls kit (so they dont need to stay home a week a month), over 12 hours of Passion Project leadership development training, and we've collected some inspiring stories that we believe will have a larger impact on those who will watch our film. We've also taken our mascot Passion (the sock monkey) on her first global trip, and used her to engage girls with laughter and create a diverse sense of community. (see pictures on our Facebook page )

I can't even put into words the impact this will have and has had not only on us but also on the girls.

Thank you to all our amazing supporters, without you, this would not be possible.

The
O07A2768
journey has just started and we need your continued support and energy. PLEASE help us make our Global Giving campaign a success. If we reach our goal we get to expand our outreach and become a vested program with Global Giving in the USA.

Only 24 hours left to help make it happen! CLICK HERE

Day 9 - Bus to Udaipur
Today we will continue our journey southeast to Udaipur, famous worldwide for its plethora of breathtaking lakes and Raj-era palaces. Most famous of these is the Lake Palace, an island-palace where the white marble buildings (now a hotel) entirely cover a small island in Pichola Lake. Originally known as the Jag Niwas, the palace took three years to build and was inaugurated in 1746.
The city's lakes-Pichola Lake, Fateh Sagar, Udai Sagar and Swaroop Sagar-are considered among the most beautiful in Rajasthan. An island in Fateh Sagar is even home to the Udaipur Solar Observatory.
So, we had another early start, we were up at about 5.45 so that we would have time for a much needed breakfast before the seven hour bus journey. We have been told that there will be a least one stop at around 10.30. I am sure that even animals at home get better travel arrangements, but that is all part of the experience, and the fact that we are travelling on a public bus, not a private one. We do have, pre booked seats which really helps the situation. Ankur encourages us not to allow ransoms to squeeze onto
image
our seats, not that he thinks we should be mean, but the drivers make extra money by squeezing people on. By us not allowing this action, it helps to stop corruption.
Bus journey over, not too bad! We arrived at the next hotel at about 3pm.
Our hotel is located inside the walled city and barely 15-20 minutes walk from the city centre. We had time for a quick shower, change of clothes and a bite to eat before meeting with Ankur at 4pm.
We set off for our orientation walk.We walked up to the centre square. On the way, passing many colourful shops and street traders. The first stop was at an artist shop/studio. He explained his art form and some of the meanings behind his art. He does really detailed miniature art. Amazing work! He then painted one fingernail for every person. He painted elephants, peacocks, even a karma sutra position on Tom! My nail has a painting of the wife of the man who built the Taj Mahal, Emperor Shah Jahan. Her name was Arjumand Bano Begum, better known as MumtzMahal. Mumtz. It is hard to believe he painted it on my nail! He took nail art
image
to a whole new level!
We then continued our walk up to watch a traditional folk dance display. The woman's dresses swirled with colour as the commanded everyone's attention throughout the show.

At 9pm, back at our hotel, we have hired the roof garden to host a private party for out group. We can have a few drinks tonight as we don't have an early start tomorrow!
What a great party we had! Everyone totally got into the spirit of things. We drank, laughed, talked and danced the night away. Jude and I were that last ones to bed.....6am!

Temple
So after travelling up the Western Ghatts through the mountains we took a 9 hour bus journey to Bangalore, which is one of the craziest cities I've been to in India, and then a 13 hour train journey to one of our target destinations Hampi. It was definatly NOT what we expected! after travelling around the cities and towns of India Hampi was a welcome break from dusty roads and extremely busy city and town centres.

Hampi is famous for its temples and the amazing rock formations that surround the area. We stayed across the river from the main town and after a 9 hour bus journay and a 13 hour train journey we were gladly met by the first person who offered us accomodation across the river. We stayed in mud huts for 3 pound a night and they had a restaurant attached that over looked the river with temples in view.

Hampi has got the feeling of Goa, is really laid back and you can easliy lose a day just doing nothing! there is a local resevoir that everyone goes to for swimming and we rented scooters for the day to have a look about. On our
Temple
last day we took a Tuk Tuk tour of some of the temples, which are pretty amazing to say the least (Check the photos below 😊 ) and packed our bags ready for our last stop in India for Christmas . . . we are heading back to Goa 😊

Sometimes best communications happens when you're on separate bikes.
I Still remember that drizzling cold midnight, it was in the end of year 2012, winter probably. I had a shower that late night and then got my bull ready, warmed up the engine, held the helmet in the hand and slowly started riding bullet in a zig-zag way on the empty outer ring road of Bangalore humming an old hindi track,

"" Pukartaa Chala Hun Main
Gali Gali Bahaar Ki
Bas Ek Chaaon Jhulf Ki
Bas ek nigaaah ho pyaaar ki
Pukaartaaa….“

I was on my way to my friends' room to join them for a whole new chapter of ‘Motorcycle Diaries’ on my Royal Bull. The worst thing happened as I reached friend's room, could not wake my friends up from their dead sleep as they hear neither my voice nor my mobile call.

Since they stay at third floor, they should have at least kept the ground floor gate open, which locks anyone in entering inside the apartment, they forgot that as well. So, now I can’t even knock their door on the third floor of the apartment. I lost all my cool and dropped the food I bought for them.

I called
Breakfast Break :)
them again and again, almost a hundred times (exaggerated round-off), I did even throw stones to their window, no use! Can you imagine this scene around 1.30am? I was on my way back to room, and my blood became as hot as engine crank.

Finally, around 4.00 in the morning, My cell phone started ringing! I picked the call, No response from either side.

First a breeze of Silence, then small spark of lightning, and then the thunder explosion...,I exploded like anything over the phone!Finally cooled down after a while, after all what’s friends for all?

May be after an hour or so, I stretched to their room again and we left early in the morning at 4.30 am after knotting bags tightly on the 'bull'. We had to keep engine idling in neutral for a while near outer ring road for Ravi to join. He was a colleague of Niyas & Majeed then. Some moods can only be understood by riders. If racing is sport, riding is art, the machine itself is art, hence the rider must be a ‘poet’ while starring. You can almost forget what you do for a living when your knees are
Into The Wild
in the breeze. On the way we had morning tea near Mandya and then set off again. We had breakfast in the second break.

Afternoon, we reached Coorg!

Green Coorg, Nestled in the western ghats is essentially a place for the nature lover, with a rich eco diversity and ever green trees like teak sandalwood. Their economy is mainly based on agriculture & forestry, coffee is a key contributor there.The people seems to be simple and friendly, we heard that the homestay culture is very well rooted over there, because we had a plan of going to Abbey Falls or Dubare elephant camp, but not sure whether we would be able to make it.We took breaks from riding, sometimes in any coffee estates, sometimes near agriculture fields or under some teak tree forest.

In the evening after a long ride, with lots of twists and turns, reached Madikkeri, a small town and had our tea, then changed the gear to Kabkabe, near our final destination Tadiyandamol. In between we lost our way, and the uncertainty added little more flavor in our ride, and somehow finally reached to Kabkabe.

If I remember correctly, we came like this
Trek it with a Snicker bite :)
: Bangalore > Mandya > Sreerangapattanam > Kushal Nagar > Madikkeri > Kemod > Kabkabhe > Thadiyandamol
Our plan was to setup a hut somewhere on the hills, and we even had the items required. But after chatting with some guys there who were running resorts, it happened to be a discussion of stay deal.They pulled us back with all of their might explaining the presence of Elephants, Forest Guards and the consequences. Finally we dropped the idea of hut in the forest hills .

By the time we knew that’s typical Resort business strategy, it was too late.

Then we went for a shot walk , it was late in the evening . But if you were a person woke up that time, you would not know whether it was early morning or dawn. The noises in that deadly silent area gave us a unique feeling.

By then, I fell in love with this killing beauty, The misty and husky Coorg. At night, after finishing heavy resort meals, We set the alarm ready and slept.

Got up at 5.30 am and set-off at 6.00 in the morning from the resort room, after 10 minute ride
Up in the clouds!
we reached a small plateau above the coffee estates by bike. No more ride possible from there, we locked the vehicles and got the backpack on our shoulder. And yes, drank some sweet forest water from the tiny falls. The trek looked easy first, Views are awesome with many a layers of hill after hill forming waves of ridges somewhere in the distance. The stream above the plateau and a few big boulders offered a good place to rest and fill water for rest of the journey. Trust me you hardly get that kind of sweet, pure and cool water.

I have got a shock in the beginning itself by seeing low battery signal in my Nikon dSLR, forgot to charge it, still I managed to capture with my Canon digital. Two of my close friends were busy in making use of their iPhone at the max with poses and clicks.

The next three kilometers were not all the simple and it took some time and effort. It gets steep and tiring but the views and the surroundings makes the walk a pleasure. Last stretch goes through a ‘real’ forest, another quick steep ascent and we are already
Niyas finds Inner Peace
at the top. It's around 8 Km and takes no more than three hours to make the journey, give or take an hour based on your fitness levels, all the way I was exasperating my friends by telling them to be fast.

And once on top, there is nothing else you would desire in a trek life, you are up in the spongy clouds with the majestic beauty of tremendous landscape around!

Thadiyandamol is the highest peak in Coorg. Its windy peak offers unhindered views of impressive mountain ranges and valleys of Coorg and beyond. Neatly stacked layers of hills align one behind the other, extending to the horizon and gently merging into the blue sky. Sensuous curves of the ridges lead down the peak and further up to the next one and the next, eventually disappearing into the mist somewhere faraway, inviting the beholder to walk along them and lose themselves in the mystery that the depth of the hills seem to convey.

Beholding the tremendous natural beauty of the scapes by all my senses, I praised The Lord of all the worlds.

While coming back, after filling our ""Bull' tanks full, we took a
Inside Namdroling Monastery
turn near Kushal Nagar to Namdroling Monastery; The Golden Temple at Bylakuppe in Coorg District, where Tibetan have the largest settlement in India, who mainly belongs to Sangha community.

If we go back to history few decades back, many monks (led by Dalai Lama ) fled to India in 60’s and continued in subsequent years to escape the wrath of Chinese forces, One of the respected monk Penor Rinchoppe put the platform for the monastery with the aim of helping those relocated monks. Over the years with every ones support it has developed a lot. Late 90’s the establishment of Golden temple became a reality. Here Buddha’s preachings are preserved for worldwide propagation .This monastery is known as a center for pure upholding of the teachings of Buddha, which is a lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in the world.

When I saw the architecture design, it reminded me of some Kun-fu marshal ads movie ‘gurukul’ set. This Tibetan architecture has enough space to host congregation of hundreds of monks. Once you’re inside, bring your attention to three imposing golden statues, Buddha in the middle, Rinchoppe to right and Amitayus to left(all Deities). There were some kind of prayer going
Temple inside the monastery compound
on and they used some instruments to make sounds at each interval , When prayer is in session, the chanting of mantras accompanied by sounds of drums and cymbals etc. resonate the place. Pillars and walls are very much decorated with designs and murals. Some sub-junior 'monks' were playing here and there.

There is one small temple in the front, completed recently which rises vertically with tires of artistic golden turrets and a golden semicircular arch on top. I forgot to tell you, An inevitable part of Buddhist temple are prayer wheel, here you may find hundreds of them, in different sizes, turning the wheel in clockwise direction during prayer considered as an effective way of supplication.

Other than agriculture, they also find time in handicrafts tradition, souvenirs sold thru stores, and of Corse you can get some Tibet style cuisine prepared there in canteen. Besides, this monastery also features a retreat Centre for monks for intensive training with food and stay. We took some clicks and packed back to Bangalore with two bottles of coorg honey, unfortunately later found that the honey was not as pure as they promised while selling.

The journey was a memorable
Golden Statues in Namdroling Monastery
one by all the ways and means, all of us became iron-butt associates due to the continuous ride on the bikes even though we took enough breaks, those who has experienced the burning can only understand it. We had dinner at Empire Restaurant, newly opened then on Mysore road, reached Bangalore around 11.30pm.

(We never know how and when misfortune would hit us,so never be afraid to slow down.)

Mamallapuram high street
Almost without exception the initial exposure elicits a profound feeling of wonderment and awe, mixed with a certain amount of repulsion and bewilderment. That first encounter with any of the possible ports of entry is an assault on the senses: the myriad colours of the disparate mass of milling humanity; the cacophony of sound; the jostling, jousting multitude of vehicles; roaming beasts; heady aromas of incense, cut flowers, spices and sandalwood battling the astringent stench of urine and stagnant effluent; and, unless arriving in a Delhi winter, all bathed in a stifling, oppressive heat. Juxtaposed, like nowhere else on earth, are tarmac and dirt, wealth and poverty, the mouth-watering and the repugnant, the hi-tech and the medieval, suited businessmen and loin clothed or naked sadhus, ladies in stunning sari/choli combinations and filthy rag-wrapped old crones, munificent kindness and indignant rudeness, trendy iphone-sporting youths and desperate broken and twisted beggars, the obese and the starving. India: our first love; the one country – to date – that we can never imagine tiring of. For the western traveller it defines culture-shock. That said, like all gut-churning, head-spinning infatuations the passion – the frissance - is inevitably tempered by familiarity. This, our sixth extended
Taxis outside Chennai airport
visit since 1990, felt more like being reacquainted with a dear but unpredictable old friend, one who you can never quite define – and therein lies the magic of the relationship.

We flew from Colombo to Chennai, lucky to be chasing the tail of the cyclone and having avoided its brunt. Previously one of our least favourite Indian cities, Chennai immediately welcomed: simple rail-links to the city centre, good cheap accommodation and excellent food. Chai stands are once again everywhere (although seemingly always referred to as tea stalls these days) and real masala tea (ginger and cardamom-infused) is well worth the few extra rupees. The amalgam of boiling milk and steeped tea is still – magically - mixed by the elaborate repeated pouring from one elevated, head-high vessel into another at waist height.

Certain changes were immediately evident from our last visit six years ago: where once all women, regardless of age, had long plaited hair, now - in Tamil Nadu at least - many boast short pixie-cuts; whilst the aging man is apparently less likely to think it a good idea to dye his hair/beard a violent shade of orange. It is also much cleaner, street-side bins
Chai vendor, Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu
are common and people use them. Predictably there are far fewer bicycles, almost no peddle rickshaws and many, many more motorbikes (far more common than mopeds) and cars.

However, street-side urination for men (and children) is still common place – some of this is pure laziness as there are far more public toilets now available in cities. Nevertheless, more than a quarter of a billion (250,000,000+) Indians still have no access to any form of a toilet and much common/derelict/in-development/simply semi-private land are the only places available for the purpose. Meanwhile, following rain, black horrors continue to bubble out from beneath the man-hole covers of inadequate sewage systems – those that are actually covered.

Power was constant whilst we were in Chennai, but in the rest of Tamil Nadu it remains erratic to say the least – in Mamallapuram, forty miles from Chennai, you’re lucky if it’s on for six hours a day.

Predictably, like the rest of Asia, mobile phones are everywhere. In fact new 3G phones with their internet access are commonplace which may explain the dearth of public wifi; really it is almost non-existent, being far more common in Laos or Myanmar. Bizarrely, whilst
Maharaja's palace, Mysore
the majority of Indians still speak only a smattering of English, they and just about everyone else in the world – except the Japanese – now answer their mobiles with “hello”.





Anyway, Mamallapuram, a mere couple of hours down the coast from Chennai, was hit hard by the tsunami which took and temporarily gave: long forgotten monuments associated with the shore temple were, momentarily, exposed by the waves only to be steadily reclaimed by sand and sea. Town is no longer scarred and has advanced well beyond any resemblance it had to back in 2004, let alone the 1990s:once mud lanes are now sealed and lined with restaurants, shops and guesthouses.We enquired at half a dozen of the latter, the cheapest of which offered us a room for 400rp ($8). Then a wizened old man appeared - don’t you just love them – and offered a place for 200rp. We went. The Hotel Five Rathas, tucked away in the residential area to the north of town, has several smallish, basic rooms to one side of a very private courtyard garden (beware the coconuts – whilst sitting chatting one crashed
Sultan's tomb, Bidar
into the table missing my head by inches). They’ll happily provide anything you may require, although most extras can be bought at a more reasonable rate independently. That does not include food – which is cheap, excellent (fish curries, tomato masalas and some of the best home-made chapattis you’re ever likely to encounter) and the longer you stay the more you’ll receive. Mother is not nearly as stern as she initially appears. Meanwhile, if you’re lucky, you may experience neighbours (most are long-stayers) like Dian (a talkative one-eared Slovenian author), or John (a 76 year young, Aussie tepee dweller – from Norfolk via Nimbin) who will, if nothing else, provide a different outlook on life. These guys did far more than that.

And then you stroll into town, passing the majestic bas-relief boulders and the stone masons squatting in the dust, and witness a whirling dervish. It isn’t quite the outpost it used to be, but it’s still… some place.





With the exception of certain rare re-visits this trip to India is all about seeing as many previously neglected destinations as possible. Consequently, they’ll be no Kerela, no Hampi, Agra and the Taj, Rajasthan’s
Arunachaleswar temple
more famous cities/forts, hill stations such as Darjeeling and maybe not even mystic Varanasi (oh, the missed photo ops). Fortunately, we’ve hardly touched the far north in prior visits – but these States will have to wait until after Bangladesh, Nepal and the start of spring as they are already snow-bound and we intend to do some serious trekking this time round. Whether we’ll have the patience and resolve to obtain the permits necessary to gain entry to the Eastern Tribal States remains to be seen.

So, after a sojourn in a familiar old haunt we set about meandering through Tamil Nadu. Nearby Auroville was a tempting start due to its bizarre credentials: a new age community of several thousand (70% Western) built on land donated by 124 countries (I’m guessing these countries all bought adjoining plots of land) and on which exists a cross between a kibbutz and a hippy commune. John was heading there, but, in all honesty, I think they’d have little demand for molecular biologists. Instead we headed west to the grand Hindu temples at Tiruvannamalai and Trichy. Both had these in spades, with soaring pyramid-like, rainbow-coloured gopurams covered with intricate figurines providing access to
Sunset over half of Om beach, Gokarn, Karnataka
ever deeper sanctums. Painted sadhu devotees bearing Shiva tridents lurkat every turn (a photo will likely set you back a cup of chai); and rich-sauced curries, accompanied by the longest-grained rice imaginable, await you at dinner. These certainly aren’t must-visit destinations (indeed Trichy is down-right expensive: cheap lodges shooed us away as soon as we approached), but were pleasant enough nevertheless.

Inside Arunachaleswar temple at Tiruvannamalai there was the sad spectacle of a performing elephant. It was surreal to witness an elephant inside a building, but also distressing to see it pacing-time, head swaying back and forth, as the faithful presented it with coins. These the elephant passed to its handler and the donators were then “rewarded” with a tap on their heads from its trunk. I had visions of the great pachyderm deciding enough was enough, hurling the crowd aside and crashing blindly through the maze of pillars. Actually, there have been a large number of deaths recently at the hands of wild elephants drawn close to towns by shrinking water holes, so much so that in certain States the locals have been warned not to walk jungle paths at dawn or after dark.



Trichy from above


Maybe after two months in Sri Lanka – where they are also staunch proponents – we are becoming immune to the ubiquitous Indian head waggle. I’m sure we go days without witnessing/receiving it; saying that, Ali reckons that I’m a bigger user than most locals. As I am totally unaware of having adopted it – let alone what I mean by it – I now feel it is unfair to expect the Indian’s usage to convey any set message.

From headshakes to handshakes; and this note really should have featured in the Sri Lanka blog as that is where Ali first experienced it. Rarely, and it was (is here) pretty rare, Ali received/s some weird bastardized handshake where the middle finger mysteriously curls, mid-grasp, to be pressed into her palm. She feels it has some unpleasant sexual connotation (and I’m sure she’s right, although I was also treated to it once; either that or the Masons have started recruiting women) and she has long since mastered the art of quick release accompanied by her sternest, withering, Paddington bear stare.





After a week of buses we finally had the option of a train: Trichy
Bas relief, Mamallapuram, Tamil Nadu
to Mysore in Karnataka. These days the ticket classes have been re-jigged. Seven years ago there were first class sleepers and first class chairs (luxurious, possibly even with AC – we were never to take one), second class sleepers with two or three tiers of bunks; second class seats and finally (and most certainly a last resort) wooden-benched third class seats. All grades could be reserved in advance with the exception of third class and some second class seats. Our target, for a journey of any real length, was always the two upper, facing bunks in three-tier second class. During the day the middle tier is dropped so that all passengers can sit on the bottom bunk. The top bunk always remains in place, giving the occupier the choice of lying down at any point during the journey – it is also closest (indeed beware if you have long hair) to the ceiling fans. Today there are air-conditioned compartments comprising just two bunks (1AC), four bunks in two tiers (2AC) or six bunks in three (3AC). Non-A.C. is limited to an open carriage of sleeper class and the new lowest grade, second class seats; apparently there is nolonger a third
Diwali, Trichy
class.

Certain major railway stations have tourist reservation offices (I’m presuming they still exist), negating the need to jostle with the masses; Trichy doesn’t. We queued (really, this does seem to be catching on) at the reservations window and were eventually informed that the train we sought was fully booked. Did we want to join the 362 people on the waiting list? This didn’t sound too promising. As we stood pondering our next move a kindly gentleman, overhearing our plight, suggested the “emergency quota”. But, I reasoned, we don’t have a valid emergency. “You’re a tourist” he smiled. So, we bought a waiting list ticket and, sure enough, on finding the appropriate office and filling the appropriate form, sleepers miraculously became available: a little shard of paper was tucked into one of a huge stack of ledgers and a beaming head shimmy confirmed that we were sorted. It isn’t fair, but the “tourist quota” of tickets on certain trains still exists, just semi-hidden behind the “emergency quota” façade (at least local people can use this in an… emergency).

As the train rumbled into the station (clean; non-smoking ;
Looking towards Om beach, Gokarn
with minimal homeless curled up for the night; far less red-jacketed coolies than normal in evidence; and – tragically – chai no longer served in handmade, unglazed disposable clay mugs) we waited by a post flashing a digital “S3” (supposedly our carriage). Indeed the sleeper carriage number three ground to a halt in front of us. The Shinkansen-esque precision parking was in no way reflected in the train: a dirty, noisy diesel engine hauling rickety wooden carriages with barred opening windows. Thankfully, as per forever, pasted to the side of the carriage was a list of all passengers and their berths - including us. As if we ever doubted Indian paperwork.

The journey, sadly only twelve hours, followed typical Indian railway standards: got chatting to friendly engaging locals (Ali obviously got to hold a baby); attempted – in-vain – to refuse proffered contents of tiffin tins; dashed off at stops/pauses for additional snacks, chai and crafty cigarettes; slept soundly and arrived early (ok, so the latter was unusual).

We didn’t really plan on staying in Mysore, but being Diwali (festival of light) there was only a skeleton staff working at the station and that didn’t include “emergency
Muslim girl, Bidar
quota” personnel (onward trains were all fully booked). Serendipity because Mysore is charming: leafy, tree-lined thoroughfares;roundabouts and squares with impressive monuments and arches; friendly, helpful people; a stunning – particularly when illuminated by its 100,000+ light bulbs (Sundays and public holidays only) – Maharaja’s palace; the Devaraja market, a narrow perfumed maze selling mountains of flower heads (for garlands), precarious conical piles of kumkum (coloured powder used for bindi dots) and benches overflowing with bottles of essential oils; plus it has a rather good roof-terraced restaurant.

On arrival we had stalked the streets seeking a reasonably priced room. Help came in the delightfully unexpected form of a young rickshaw driver: no lift required, no commission extorted, just simple directions provided. We bumped into him several times over the next few days, always declining his offers of cheap prices to the sights (it’s actually a good hearty walk to Chamundi hill for its panoramic views over the city). However, on hearing how we could earn him in excess of 400 rps commission and a new jacket (standard rickshaw issue) at no cost to ourselves we felt compelled to return the favour. And so with the aid of our smartest clothes,
Sunset at Om, Karnataka
his cousin’s taxi (for impressive arrivals) and convincing touristic buying-heads on, we toured the swanky silk/carpet/artifact emporia. We took pictures of the pashmina that our mothers would select between, weighed up the bronze statues, drank some wonderful gratis teas, promised returns and bought diddly-squat. He and his cousin must have done well as they later treated us to further teas.





From Mysore to Mangalore; just an overnight stop, but worth it if only for the souvalaki-style chicken shwarmis and then on to the fabled Gokarn(a) and Om beach. Somehow Om missed our radar twenty-odd years ago. We learned of it through Steve Carey and his ballad “Chai Chillum Chapatti” (recited live to The Usual Suspects most – inspired - nights at Felix’s in Benaulum, Goa) in the late 1990s, but still we hadn’t partaken.

The dusty town of Gokarn is not without its visitors, western and local alike (it has several important, mainly Shiva, temples). It does have tourist flotsam, but is still an independently functioning town and definitely retains soul. And then you walk the forty minutes to Om (the lazy can now rickshaw almost the entire way) and
Gopuram detail, Trichy
are transported back to that fleeting period when India’s beaches hit their tourist zenith: dispersed and discrete enclaves of beach huts that are almost invisible from the lustrous bays and yet serve all possible – backpacker - needs. Yes, you can advance further along the wooded coastline to the very rustic Half Moon beach (15 mins) or yet further to Paradise (another 20 mins) where it is still primarily camping and self-reliance; but really, Om is paradise: Sangam’s is on our short list for best guesthouse in Asia. In the words of Steve’s song: “Dolphins in the magic sea, coconuts among the trees, smiling faces, life is free – internationally; half past six time slips away, as day and night revolve we play, watch the sun set from the rocks….Chillum”. We dragged ourselves away after fifteen days; it could have been fifteen weeks. We missed it instantly.

Obviously, two weeks spent throwing a Frisbee, browning to a crisp, chilling, following the first two Test matches, devouring books and anything from Sangam’s excellent kitchen, supping ginger-lemon tea, cold beers and the odd old monk rum doesn’t make for lengthy prose – hurrah, I hear you say
Garland vendor
– but, and here I really am loath to promote: go before it changes. There is (surely) no finer beach scene in India. Big thanks to the mystic Israeli, the Bangalore crowd, Mr. Bhang and particularly the wonderful staff of Sangam’s.





Wow, and that brings up a year. How time flies…

We advanced up the coast to Christian Goa where saris are largely replaced by printed dresses and alcohol is at its cheapest and most accessible. Rurally, haystacks resemble giant muffins, pigs roam freely and the cow is no longer revered, indeed it may also end up in a tangy, vinegary vindaloo. We stayed in Palolem, at a quaint, quiet, family-run place set back from the – now ruined – over-developed beach. This was a great spot twelve years ago and, to be fair, still isn’t a bad place for a holiday: the sea food is good, but… it isn’t what it once was. Moved onto Panaji, supposedly one of India’s most picturesque State Capitals and it really does have a lost in time feel, very much like Malaysia’s Melaka or Georgetown with old colonial relics and dreamy winding backstreets. Nevertheless, the
Inside Bidar fort
only budget option found us in a grim hole with me sleeping on a rattan mat on the floor. Aging bones forced us to upgrade for the second night to a pleasant enough room, but with the spitefully mean (not yet Tracy) check-out time of 8.30 a.m.

Margao has replaced Vasco De Gama as the train hub of Goa and has modernized rapidly. It also epitomizes the problems, reported in the press, that Goa is having with alcohol. Our hotel – there are no guesthouses to speak of, only local flop-houses that patently would not have been either secure or safe – located near the train station was surrounded by wine shops and grotty bars (many so grim that even we would not consider patronage) and by mid-afternoon the streets were littered with prone drunks. It’s heart-rending enough to be surrounded by poverty, but even worse when a sizable proportion is obviously linked to alcohol abuse.

Nevertheless, we did take advantage of Goa’s cheap alcohol and purchased 6 small bottles of Old Monk which we know will prove invaluable for upcoming dry States such as Gujarat. What we didn’t realize is that transporting alcohol out of
South gate of Sri Ranganthaswarmy temple, Trichy, TN.
Goa requires a license and that regular checks are made at the borders with other States. Failure to produce a license (easily obtained from the bottle shop if you are aware of the necessity) can result in fines and/or confiscation. We packed the contraband wisely and ran the risk – successfully.

Leaving the beaten track we headed north east to the fort town of Bidar. This is not an easily accessed destination (trains via Hyderabad, the simplest route, were fully booked for days and there is no emergency quota) and saw us take a train to Hubli (5 hrs), another to Bijapur (6 hrs) where we stayed overnight, then buses to Gulbara (4 hrs), Sirdoan (30 mins) - walk over the bridge here as it too weak to take heavy vehicles, and finally another to Bidar (3 hrs). This region of Karnataka is very agricultural and we passed golden fields of thirsty sunflowers with heavy bowed heads, green fields of squat chenna (not sure if these are soya beans or chickpeas or something more exotic) and great expanses of sugar cane, much of it in the process of being harvested and hauled off in oxen-drawn carts or towering lorries.
Watching the sunset from the rocks... Om
Meanwhile, Goa’s muffin haystacks have morphed into concave teepees.

Contrary to what we were expecting, getting away from the tourist trail (we haven’t seen a white face in a week) has not seen a decrease in accommodation prices, in fact quite the opposite. No habitable rooms exist in Bijapur for less than 500 rp and Bidar is only marginally cheaper. The room we took in Bijapur was tiny with peeling walls and the odd cockroach (no problems with that at all), but a filthy encrusted toilet and dirty sheets at $10/night is peevishly shoddy indeed. Remove the bloody television – saving on electricity – and pay someone to actually clean the room.

Thankfully, Bidar proved to be worthy of the effort: a bustling town with friendly inquisitive locals including a sizable Muslim population, mosques outnumbering Hindu temples; atmospheric, crumbling sultan’s tombs (packed with burka-clad visitors – we were attractions in our own right); and the wonderful ruins of Bidar’s 15th century fort spread out over undulating hills with its winding, triple-gated entrance, 5.5km of encircling battlements inside three moats hewn from solid red rock.

Rasganga pure veg restaurant deserves a special mention for its delicious
Garland vendor, Mysore
and dirt cheap special thalis.

Western tourists are obviously a rarity in Bidar and the usual questions of “What country?”, “What’s your name?” and “How many children?” were typically replaced with – in the nicest possible way - “Why you come here?”.





Anyway, from here we will head to Nagpur where we hope (subject to ticket availability) to attend several days of the last Test match – we’ll be wearing the Burmese hats (keep your eyes peeled for us on the television).

Oh, five weeks into India and (I am touching wood at this point) not a single stomach bug – how times have changed.





And finally….

Yes, I can’t resist a quick mini resume of the last twelve months: Hong Kong, China (very superficially – back there next year), Laos, Cambodia, Thailand (just passing through), Malaysia, Indonesia (seven islands), Myanmar, Sri Lanka and India (on-going).

It has to be said that this doesn’t seem like a lot of countries for a year and, for that matter, it is only four new countries for us. Still, it has been a fantastic year and one we’re very
Tomb, Bidar
grateful for.

Highlights:

a) People: ha, now that I have a list of countries in front of me I see that few wouldn’t merit special mention; however, for us the Cambodian’s, Sumatrans, Myanmar and Sri Lankans were very, very special indeed. Hell, the Laos were delightful; whilst the Chinese are far friendlier now than we remembered them. On a negative note, many touristic areas of Bali and Lombok in Indonesia should be ashamed of themselves; whilst the Thai’s seem plain jaded.





b) Sights: China (and so much more to see); certain Indonesian islands (Sumatra: almost everything we were privileged to experience, Lombok’s Mt. Rinjaniand Suluweisi, not to mention the sunsets, orangs, dragons and snorkeling); and Myanmar’s Bagan.





c) Food: Every country has provided something exceptional (save Hong Kong where we know they have it, but price prohibited enjoying it – they do have great Maccy Ds though). Laos for banana flower and rattan salads and Tai Dam food (Papaya restaurant was magnificent); Cambodia for their special – and at no extra cost – pizzas; Melakain Malaysia for sublime noodles; goes without saying anything cooked by Mark;
Bombay Badam milk, Tiruvannamalai
Indonesia for the gorengan and Warung Bambu’s pelecing kangkung and bakso; Myanmar for its Shan and Mon cuisines; Sri Lanka’s veggie curries – yes, I am thinking of Mrs.Bawa’s; and India is just simply food heaven.





d) Alcohol: It has to be said that China can out budget anyone in South East Asia in terms of beer (lager), although both Laos and Cambodia (and Malaysia’s duty-free LangKawi) have notably cheap brews; Indonesia and Sri Lanka for their variations on palm and rice wines – the latter in particular for the ambiance of the drinking experience.





e) All round backpacker price-friendliness: current thinking would beLaos but we’re still saying India, although it is no way as clear cut as it once was. The big surprises were that Myanmar and Sri Lanka really can be experienced on a small budget (both cheaper than Laos for us, plus Laos didn’t have to absorb any flights). Indeed South East Asia is still backpacker heaven pricewise (just don’t rely on Lonely-sell-out-Planet for any bargains) - even with 16 flight tickets and 16 visas we are still averaging a fraction under $40/day ($39.96 as

I type) between us and we weren’t expecting that.

December 1st 2012
Published: December 2nd 2012


Vinceya at the Speakers
December has shown its face, and my Travel Blog countdown is nearly to the single digits.

I will likely put up a couple more blogs before my India Adventure concludes (We still have a Christmas celebration to document!), but I wanted to take a moment to reflect on my time here, and on what December brings for me and the students.

I know that I've mainly written positive things for my blog entries, and I know that many of you are probably asking, ""Is it really that great over there?"" And the answer is that I guess I've been a little dishonest in my writing. It hasn't all be great. There are days (especially recently) when I want to run to my room screaming, ""BUT I'M NOT EVEN PAID FOR THIS JOB!"" I am often confronted with ""surprises,"" like a fundraising concert where the choir had to brush-up/learn seven songs in eleven days (more on the concert in a moment), or when the 12th graders are suddenly thrown into a block schedule of studying and testing that not only conflicts with half of my time with the 11th graders, but makes it so I am working virtually the whole
Haemon
This little dude is quite the cutie. He is a second grader, but he's much smaller than his other classmates, and his energy is just adorable.
school day (and before and after for prep, choir, voice lessons, and PT). I don't do well with scheduling surprises. I need 24 hours to process, and that has often not been given to me (or my supervisor, for that matter).

But, here's the thing: Even after a truly dreadful day, like this past Monday, where the 12th graders are sleepy and I'm so stressed I can't make decisions, something beautiful happens. On Monday, this came in the form of Creative Writing with the 8th graders. I was just given this class the week previous, to fill a gap created by a departed volunteer. I was not looking forward to ending my Monday with them, as my first class with them the previous week had been hellish: I had been so excited to talk about archetypes with them by sharing one of my favorite concept albums (Light Chasers by Cloud Cult...so beautiful) and having them write a story inspired by the archeypal events the music follows, but they did not understand and continued interrupting me before I could explain. And then, when I came to pick up the first part of their stories on Friday, not a single one
Supria
of them had done the homework because they were ""too busy studying for exams."" When they told me this, I had to walk out of the room before I said something I'd regret. Instead, I vented to Lizzy, and I know she and several other staff members reprimanded them, so I was also wary of how the 8th graders would react to the project (the album was only about half-completed) now that they'd gotten in trouble over it. But when I came in this Monday, the students were apologetic and then, after we listened to a few more songs, legitimately involved in the project. Of course, I also made some adjustments to clarify things, but they met me halfway, and by the end some were singing along. Some stayed after class to listen to the final song. Where I (and perhaps they) had least expected it, we ended up having a wonderful time.

I think this is one of the reasons I like teaching. You can take it on a day-to-day basis and, although something may go horribly, you are forced to either face the issue or determine it is negligable the next day and move forward. Either way,
Waiting
This picture reveals so much about my students. Sujatha, the one behind her hands, is a mischievous 11th Grader. Nickhil, in the red, is always very chill. Shrimathi, smiling, loves attention. And Vijay, in the stripes, often looks a little tired (especially in class) :-D
I have learned that humans of any age have ample capacities for forgiveness. If only it could be exercised more outside of the classroom.

In any case, this past week has also felt insane because we have been preparing for a fundraising concert. A group of 34 choir members has been rehearsing with me an hour every night, losing some of their precious studying time for exams (starting December 3). I am so proud of the work they have done, but rehearsals haven't been without their struggles. The performance space doesn't have any piano, so we had to record the accompanist, and I don't think the students understand just how much their accompanists have been adjusting to their fluctuating speeds--I cannot tell you how many complaints I've received about the speed of the recordings. They also are not used to actively watching a conductor, which is more necessary than ever now that we don't have live accompaniment. But, except for ""Memories,"" which the students found either too fast or too slow, depending on who was talking, we brought everything together nicely for the performance.

We all packed onto a bus and rode for 1.5 hours to Rainbow Drive,
The Choir
a gated community outside of Bangalore. Apparently, SB students don't travel very much, and are prone to terrible motion sickness. In light of this, each student was given a ""vomit cover"" (cover being the word used for bag) and some chewing gum. I was lucky to be sitting with some folks who were decidedly not carsick. Lizzy brough her speakers and ipod, so we listened to music and danced and played a (slightly unfair) game of ""Never Have I Ever."" When we arrived, we set up and then were given delicious food. We didn't have enough time to rehearse anything on the stage, which was unfortunate, and the audience didn't really finish arriving until 30 minutes after we were supposed to start, which was also unfortunate. The kids were antsy, as we had already seated them in front of the audience, and so they were put under scrutiny for an extended period of time.

When the concert finally did begin, we had several problems with sound, and at first I could not hear the music from my conducting spot. I changed location, which improved my hearing significantly, and although the choir was clearly nervous and unused to singing in large echoey spaces, they were extremely attentive, and we managed to pull through. After the concert, we were given cake and juice boxes, which are very special treats for the kids.

And now, here I am, sitting in a hotel room in Bangalore on Sunday morning, taking what I've deemed a ""Me-Weekend."" I only have twelve more days left in India, so this will likely be my last chance to explore outside of SB. It's strange, to roam a city alone after spending most of your days at a secluded school. When I return to SB, it will be time for exams and more choir rehearsals for the ""German Party"" next weekend--another event in Bangalore that SB students go to each year because the attendees are some of our biggest sponsors. But for now, I'm just going to relax, meet a friend of a friend for lunch, and take some time to reflect.

Lakshmi the Elephant
Rubba dub-dub.
I made a promise in my last entry that I would dedicate this entry to ruins and the movie Up, and I have no intention of disappointing (I know you all must be sitting at the edge of your seats, dying to hear about both). First, some ruins, and then I'll move on to this Upbusiness when I get to that part of the story.

Our ruins exploration took several different forms over a couple of days: One day, we walked to one end of the Bazaar and wandered around, and the next we went to the other end of the Bazaar, where the Virupaksha Temple is, and Peter and I took a bike tour from there (Ally doesn't bike so well, so Bitsy agreed to walk around with her instead of touring with us).

(Before I get too far, I want to give a little disclaimer: I was inundated with a lot of interesting information over this week, but I wouldn't be surprised if I wrote something down incorrectly. If, by any means, I misspeak about a tradition or concept, I would like to apologize in advance, and invite you to bring light to the mistake. the last

thing I want to do is provide everyone with a ton of misinformation.)

A little bit of background regarding the ruins, and why they are where they are, surrounding the little town of Hampi: The ruins are from the 7th c.-16 c., and display the growth of an empire that at one time covered half of India. Hampi was the hub of this empire, and the Hampi Bazaar was once filled with vendors selling precious jewels. Hampi's golden age was from around 1520-1560, but ended when it was invaded and subsequently occupied for a grand total of 6 months. After that time, the invaders moved on, but took Hampi's wealth and any chance of rebuilding the empire with them.

When you walk to the end opposite the Virupaksha Temple, you are greeted by this fantastic monolithic bull. In Hinduism, bull-statues are called nandi, and they are a symbol of Shiva. The monolithic bull is impressive, but can no longer be considered holy because it is broken. Hampi is actually home to a one-of-a-kind nandi (a very small one, but memorable all the same) with three heads, which is believed to symbolize the unity of the three main gods:
Monolithic Bull (aka Nandi)
Brahma, the Generator; Vishnu, the Operator; and Shiva, the Destroyer. Get it? Generator Operator Destroyer. GOD. My tour guide's, Hanuman's (yes, just like the monkey-god), face lit up when he told us that trick to remember the key Hindu gods.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Back to our un-guided ruin-wandering.

After you passed the monolithic nandi, you descended into a large temple, complete with deteriorating columns and doorways. Bitsy and I sat and admired the architecture for quite some time, enjoying the quiet, the rest (this was the same day as the Hanuman Temple climb), and the shade.

And then, all of a sudden, I heard it.

At first, I didn't believe my ears, but then it happened again, and I told Bitsy, and she listened for it too. It happened a third time, and there was no denying it.

We found Kevin.

Okay, so that was enough drama for a not-so-dramatic moment, but I will be perfectly honest that this made my day. For those of you who are not familiar with the movie Up, or for those who need a refresher, Kevin is the large fictional bird (called a ""snipe"") that
Holy Water Tank
resembles an oversized, colorful dodo. She has a very distinct call--one that cannot be mistaken--and we definitely heard her many times somewhere in the rocky distance. I did some research, and found out that she was designed to resemble the male himilayan monal pheasant, but when I listened to the call of said pheasant, I was disappointed to find it completely different from Kevin's. So, in short, I have no idea what type of bird I heard, but I like to imagine there is a giant chocolate-loving snipe roaming among the boulders of Hampi.

And while I'm on the subject of boulders: One of the things that baffled me when I first started walking around Hampi is that there are many boulders with a thin line of square holes across its face. It turns out that this is evidence of harvested rock. Quarriers would make little nodules in which they would squeeze squares of wood. When the wood got wet, it would expand, and break the rock.

The following day, when we went into Virupaksha Temple (before the bike tour), we were told to go to the river to see Lakshmi the Elephant get her bath. She later

blessed Peter and Ally (put her trunk over their heads). Peter was then approached by a couple of tour guides, both with whom he had agreed to go on tours. They were from the same company, but what Peter didn't realize was that they worked independently during the same hours, so they decided to ask him to choose which one he wanted to be our guide. He chose Hanuman (to whom he had spoken earlier than the other), and we certainly were not disappointed.

Hanuman took us to a bike rental place and outfitted us with some really nice 1-speed bikes (no, really, they were well-kept). He led us to about eight or so stops, mostly temples of various sorts. We learned that Virupaksha Temple was considered a very holy place because Vishnu's symbol, the lingam (which is a cylindrical, basically unmarked slab of rock), was naturally found there without human alteration. We visited a couple of Ganesha temples with broken monoliths (""Peanut Ganesha,"" named after the shape of the dent in his belly; and ""Mustard Ganesha,"" named so because the man who built it made all of his money as a mustard seed vendor). Across from Mustard Ganesha

Somewhere in the direction of Kevin.
was another large bazaar, with what looks like a beautiful pool. Turns out that it was actually a tank used for holy water, and was blessed at least once a year by a procession walking around it clockwise (you always do this at Hindu temples).

We also visited the Hazara Rama Temple which, if I remember correctly, is supposed to be on the site of Rama and Sita's wedding. In any case, the temple is covered with a series of pictograms that tell the Ramanyana, and after Hanuman (the guide) was finished giving us a brief description and showed us the very beginning of the story, Peter found the pictograph of Hanuman (the god) showing Rama's ring to Sita (see part 2 if you have no idea what I'm talking about). That made us feel like quite the accomplished students.

So, that's all for ruins and Kevin...but WAIT! There's more action-packed adventure to come! Filled with bicycle accidents and train-chases and McDonalds!

But, for now, much love from India!

Yoga Paradise
Okay, friends. Now for the second installment of my holiday adventures (or, should I say, ""Now to our featured presentation!""):

The second morning at Hampi, we decided to go to the Hanuman Temple on Anjaneya Hill. This temple is still-functioning, and is one of about four places that claims to be the birthplace of Hanuman, a very important monkey god.

Some background on Hanuman: He plays a huge role in the Ramanyana, the epic tale of Rama's (one of Vishnu's incarnations) battles against the 10-headed demon king of Sri Lanka. The tale begins with the demon king's abduction of Sita (Rama's wife). Hanuman becomes one of Rama's followers and, when Rama is unable to cross a large body of water to get to Sri Lanka, Hanuman leaps (or ""flies like Superman"" according to a tour guide) across with Rama's ring to show Sita that he is a friend. Of course, there is a lot more to tell, but that gives you an idea of Hanuman's devotion.

To get to the temple, we had to take a rickshaw to the river, then cross the river by boat because there is no functioning bridge in the area. The boat was

The reason why we needed to take a boat to get to Hanuman Temple
small and cramped with motor-bikes, but it was a short ride and the morning air was lovely. We then had to take another rickshaw by lush fields and through small towns to the base of Anjaneya Hill.

So, the temple is up about 570 steps, and even in the morning sun, it was a difficult climb. But once we reached the top, we were welcomed by a beautiful view, prayer-chanting in a small shrine, and monkeys. For a long time, we kneeled in the dark shrine and listened to the chanters, who were doing a call-and-response. Then I went back out to enjoy the scenery, while the others stayed inside.

When they came out, they each had bindis on their foreheads, and they directed me to another small room where I could be blessed by Hanuman. As soon as I entered the shrine, I wished I had seen someone else perform the blessing ceremony first. There were several local women and a boy kneeling in the room, and a small table spread with various dishes and items, and I had no idea where to start. The women looked at me expectantly for a moment, then, realizing my panic,
The View
made a gesture to the boy. He took a small spoon and put holy water into my cupped hands, which the women then gestured for me to drink. I tried, but it basically just touched my lips because I hesitated too long and the water was already falling from between my fingers. Then the boy gave me a handful of sugar, and I was told to eat that, which I did readily. After that, there was a long awkward pause, in which I figured I was supposed to put the bindi on my forehead, but I could not figure out in the dim light which bowl held the powder. The boy seemed hesitant, too (maybe he was not allowed to help me with that part?), and eventually one of the women stood and put the bindi on my forehead. I thanked her and the others as best I could, but I have to admit that I came out feeling like a fool. Hopefully Hanuman understands that I had the best intentions.

When I reemerged, I noticed Peter disappearing over a big boulder behind the shrine. When I looked closer, I realized that there were man-made steps at the base,
The Lonely Tree
and so I decided to do some climbing, too. It turns out that there is a path laid out to a small man-made pond and a single tree among the rocks, straight from your favorite kung-fu movie. The view from was amazing, and the openness at the very top of the hill made you want to stay up there forever.

I'm going to save my ruins exploits from this day and the next for my next entry, but I also wanted to point out that we discovered another fabulous restuarant in Hampi called the Bamboo Tree. It is a roof-top place, with low tables and cushions and pretty darn good naan. It would be a great place to sit back and read a book, though I never got the opportunity to do so.

Next on the docket: Ruins, temples, and how I found a little bit of ""Up"" in India.

Holiday Travels
On Saturday night, we took an overnight bus from Bangalore to Hospet, which is next to Hampi. On Wednesday we took an overnight train to Hyderabad. On Friday we took another overnight train back to Bangalore.


Fancy Meal in Bangalore
Red snapper and rice pilaf.
Well, this week has certainly been quite the adventure. There is quite a bit that I'd love to tell you all, but I'm getting the feeling that it may take a while for me to sprinkle all of my impressions into my various entries. I certainly can't put it all in one, because it would look a bit like a novella in length. So, I've decided to break certain ideas/observations into specific topic-entries. But I thought it'd be nice to give a general overview of my travels here and in a few subsequent entries.

Our adventures began in Bangalore, with a fine mediterranean meal on the roof of a nice, clean mall. It was the most lavish meal I've had in India to date, but I am finding more and more that I don't really crave fancy food here. I'm far more interested in trying the local dishes. In any case, we arrived at the bus station full and happy.

Allow me to give some background: ""We"" refers to the five intrepid travellers who set off for Hampi. There was my roommate, Ally, my On-Site Administrator, Lizzy, and two other coworkers, Bitsy and Peter. Lizzy left our group on
Bus to Hampi
We look more comfortable than we are.
Monday night, and Bitsy went back on Wednesday night, leaving Ally, Peter, and me to the mercy of Hyderabad (more on that later :-) ). The intended itinerary was to arrive at Hampi on Sunday morning, and to leave for Hyderabad on Wednesday night (arriving Thursday morning). Hampi (pronounced ""Hum-pee""--the kids told us to think of humming while peeing) is known for its ruins and rocky vistas. Hyderabad is a large city known for its pearls, but also with some recommended museums/areas.

In any case, the night bus to Hampi was dreadful. When it comes to public transportation, I am pretty relaxed, but this bus made me realize just how uncomfortable transportation can be. All night buses without beds are pretty bad, but remember how I said that honking was the only mode of vehicle communication in India? Well, that doesn't change when the sun goes down. Even in the country, you'd just start to nod off and the bus horn would stab you through one ear and out the other. And I was lucky enough to be next to a vertical pole, so when I jerked my head up in surprise, I'd wham it against the pole. The

frequent sudden braking caused similar discomfort.

And then there was the bathroom incident. The bus stopped about four times total for an 8-hour drive, and the first one was nearly 1/2 an hour long. Bitsy, Lizzy, and I thought that the second stop would be about as long, so we got off to use the toilet. It was my first pit toilet experience, but I got through it well, and came out of the bathroom very proud of myself. Bitsy was there waiting for me, and we walked out together. But when we got out, the bus was already moving. Lizzy was nowhere in sight, but we ran and one of the bus drivers was out there calling to us. Luckily, Lizzy got on the bus before us to point out that we were still in the bathroom. We laughed it off, but I can't help but be grateful that we were not left at a toilet in the middle of nowhere at night. That would be a whole different adventure entirely!

Needless to say, we arrived at the Hospet station (30 minutes from Hampi) intact, and after evading some very pushy rickshaw drivers, managed to catch the

first bus into Hampi. I made the mistake of letting my guard down at this point--I imagined that we would get off the bus, get breakfast, and stroll around to find a nice hotel. But, as soon as we pulled into the Hampi Bazaar, a mob of business owners surrounded us, pushing maps and business cards into our hands (and taking them back away when we did not agree to follow them). They followed us for about fifteen minutes, bombarding us with recommendations every time we stopped to discuss a possible plan of action. Eventually, they began to trickle away, but two or three stuck around for much longer, most notably the owner of the Gopi Hotel and Restaurant (which looked like a good enough establishment, but in which I swore I would never step foot because of the owner's overbearing pushiness). There were guest houses everywhere in the little city proper and it was the off-season, so we had our pick. The problem was, the hotel that we arbitrarily picked from the guidebook in the frenzy of being followed turned out to be recently demolished. Tired, unbathed, and hungry, we finally allowed ourselves to be guided to the Moon

Light Restaurant to regroup.

I have come to understand that it doesn't matter where in the world a small town is; the small-town web of connections exists in Hampi as much as it does in Morris. The restaurant owner picked up on our dilemma pretty quickly, and kindly recommended his cousin's guest house. His daughter even made some calls to make sure there were two rooms available. Grateful for the guidance, we checked it out (Manju Guest House--I highly recommend it), and were pleased to find it clean and spacious.

And so--though the prologue to our trip was rather stressful--began the amazing visit to Hampi.

By the time we were all settled in our hotel, it was only about 10 a.m., so we had a whole day to look forward to. We started wandering the streets and looking in the little shops. The streets in the town proper are small, with colorful buildings and wash hanging on the lines. There is no doubt that Hampi is a tourist town, as there was a travel agent, cyber cafe, bike rental, and guest house on every block. But, as it was the off-season, it was not too crowded (even
Ganesha
The Ganesha statue that was eventually immersed into the river
with the dozens of cows roaming the narrow roads), and although the shop owners were very vocal in asking us to look at their wares, we were no longer harassed or followed. The typical Hampi response to ""No, thank you,"" was a smile and, ""Maybe tomorrow"" as if there would be enough tomorrows to satisfy every request.

I stumbled upon my favorite little shop toward the end of the afternoon. It was basically unmarked, but had walls coverred with figurines and postcards and secondhand books. I found a pile of ""singing bowls"" on a bottom shelf, and asked the store owner about the purpose of the different tones. Before I knew it, I was sitting on the floor with the shopkeeper, trying to play various sizes and shapes of bowl. When water is put into an unblemished hand-made bowl, it will begin to sparkle and leap when the bowl is played. The shop keeper was very good at it, and patient when I had trouble figuring out how to hold the bowl and stick. Eventually, Peter joined in, and we were all playing an atonal symphony. Absolutely beautiful!

That evening, we determined that we wanted to go to
Palak Paneer at Mango Tree
Meals served Mango Tree-style, on a banana leaf.
Mango Tree, which came highly recommended by everybody we talked to. We had some trouble finding it, though, and ended up on the Hampi Bazaar. Good thing, too, because nobody would have been at the restaurant. Turns out that it was the fifth day of celebrating Ganesha's birthday, and we were in for a treat.

Some background on Ganesha: He is the elephant-headed god of good fortune, and the son of Parvati, wife of Shiva. While Shiva was out, Parvati bore a baby god to protect her while she bathed. The new god did, but was thought an intruder and beheaded by Shiva upon Shiva's return. Parvati was distraught and insisted that Shiva find a new head for her child, and he brought back an elephant's head. In remembrance of this story, stautes of Ganesha are immersed in local bodies of water on an ordained day (which varies depending on who you're talking to).

So, we stumbled upon the Immersion procession on Hampi Bazaar, and were almost immmediately greeted by a crowd of locals and a sprinkling of foreign visitors like us. The Ganesha statue was in a trailer on the back of a tractor (again, some small town things are strikingly familiar), and people were passing by, giving their respects to the deity. Soon, there was drumming, and dancing, and kids started running around to slap red or yellow chalk on people's faces. At first, I was wary of joining in the dancing, because it seemed to be mostly local men and children, but then male tourists and eventually female tourists joined in, and by sunset, the procession was underway. A small local girl asked me to put her on my shoulders, and we had a blast bopping around. Ally was carrying the girl's friend, so they would grab hands and dance together on our shoulders.

The procession took a total of about 1 1/2 hours to get to the riverside (1-2 kms.), because we'd take a few steps, and then the drums would start up again and people would get swept up in the dancing again. Eventually, the road became a rocky path and Ganesha had to be carried by several men. As we moved down to the river, the drumming stopped and the chanting began. We walked by haunting ruins in the rock-face, and through a small cavern to the bank of the river. Once there, we sat and watched by flashlight as Ganesha was immersed in the water. Beautiful.

We capped off the night with the long-awaited visit to the Mango Tree, which served us delicious food on banana leaves. It was a perfect ending to an eventful, wonderful day.

Stay tuned for more on ruins, monkeys, and trains, coming soon to a computer near you!

Love,

Lynn

Bangalore building
Bangalore has a slight traffic problem. The city has turned into an Indian powerhouse, and is the hub of the IT and telcoms explosion that is driving unprecedented growth in southern India. However, I'm sure the founding fathers never imagined their native town would become a major city on the subcontinent. As such, the streets of Bangalore weren't designed on a grid, and the city centre is a mishmash of one way streets that wend their way around town like a sinuous snake. The traffic is the worst I've experienced in India, and the inevitable result of the chaos makes for some prodigious traffic jams. So what does an Indian do when their car or bike has their progress impeded, yes you guessed it, it's time to lean on the horn. Bangalore is a cacophony of noise and traffic, but the centre of the city based around Cubbin park is pleasantly clean and modern.

Let's perform a quick reboot, constant reader, to bring you up to speed. We left off in Goa, with your humble correspondent feeling sick as a dog in a Goa resort town. It's not an ideal situation, to be sure, but it is the situation nevertheless.
Lalbagh botanical gardens
I farewelled the staff and travellers from the guest house, and jumped a taxi for the hour long drive back to Dabolim airport. From there I hopped on a Go Air jet for the one hour flight to Bangalore, and then jumped a further taxi for the long drive into town. I booked into the recommended Sumanjay homestay in the heart of the city, and had a few days to explore this excellent city. There's a long term guest from Switzerland staying at the homestay, and the friendly Indian owners made me feel very welcome. I'm still feeling quite fragile, but am well enough to get out and about to explore the sights.

It's amazing how illness dents one's confidence, and my first morning in Bangalore I was nervous as a racehorse before heading out. However, it's simply a matter of getting back on the bike, and as soon as I left the guesthouse to negotiate with auto (tuk tuk) drivers it all started to come together. I spent the first day exploring Cubbin park, and the famous monuments in the vicinity. It's likely you will become hopelessly lost in this city of one way streets, but once I
Central Bangalore
gave in to the situation and just asked the locals for directions at crucial intersections I was able to find my way eventually. The parliament and high court buildings are impressive, and Cubbin park itself is great for walking around.

There's one daily ritual I seem to go through on the subcontinent, where I say something slowly and clearly to an English speaker. They reply with something weird, sometimes not even related to the topic as far as I can discern. I look confused, then repeat myself and get the answer I was seeking first time around. But the important thing is that Indians are an engaging and friendly nation of people, who will do what they can to help travellers get by in this complex country. I spent a pleasant first evening over dinner with the Swiss guy from the homestay, where we traded stories about India over a beer and an excellent meal. It was great to get out to a quality restaurant in the heart of the entertainment district.



I set out next morning to explore Lalbagh botanical gardens, which is around five kilometres further out from the city centre. The park is
Central Bangalore
super impressive, featuring a vast variety of species set in luscious grounds. The gardens are so big I spent over two hours exploring the park, and bumped into several friendly Indian people who were happy to stop and chat. It's hard to believe you are in a bustling Indian city when strolling within the grounds of Lalbagh, and the park is highly recommended as a tourist destination. At the end of the day my auto driver was driving me back to the guesthouse when we got stuck in a traffic jam ... again! Anyways, a tout was selling genuine rayban sunglasses, and I beat him down to 200 rupees. That's incredible, I thought, only four dollars for the genuine article when they cost a fortune in Australia. My driver scolded me after the transaction, and said I should only have paid 100 rupees. Come on, I thought, two dollars for genuine raybans surely cannot be possible? So I handed over my old pair to placate him, and he sported them with pride while driving me home, often taking the time to style it up in the mirror.

During my final evening in India I packed up, farewelled the owners,
Lalbagh shrub
and jumped a taxi back to the airport. I had a flight booked to Colombo, and the only way to get there is to fly north to Mumbai, and link up with an international flight. I arrived at Mumbai domestic terminal around midnight with the plane thirty minutes late, feeling pressed for time, tired and sick. It was left to our friend's from Mumbai's unregistered taxi industry to administer a final kick up the arse before leaving the country, and they didn't miss! I was surprised there was noone around to help, and the sharks starting circling within an instant. I tried to fend them off, stating this wasn't a licensed taxi, where is the meter, why are there two of you in the car, how much etc but they were just too good for me. I was worried about my connecting flight, and they kept pressing the issue with rapid fire talking. Before I knew it I was in the car, they drove me a little, then stopped and produced some ridiculous brochure with prices on it. I was up for the equivalent of $65 to get to the international terminal, and had no idea how far it was.
Locals pose at Lalbagh
The only 'facts' I knew were the non stop lies spewing from their mouths. I had less than $40 cash in total, which they relieved me of in a flash, then fobbed me off to some poor sap who had the unpleasant task of driving me the 15 minutes to the airport. The sharks told me the international airport was 45 minutes away, and even a fare for that distance costs less than $10 dollars in India. On arrival we queued with tuk tuks, which the shysters swore were not allowed at the international terminal. I was furious, and told my driver in no uncertain terms how displeased I was with the unethical, exploitative and immoral behaviour of his associates. I think the guy was genuinely uncomfortable with the situation, as he's just a pawn in this well organised criminal racket!

Anyways, I maintained my rage all the way to Colombo, but eventually cooled off for the final day staying at Marine Tourist Guest House on Negombo beach. I was pleased to greet the friendly staff again, and gratefully climbed into a bed for several hours to have a kip. I took the opportunity to go for a long
Steps to High Court
walk along the beach in the afternoon, and dive in the water for a final swim before my flight home tonight. My trip to the Indian subcontinent has been unforgettable, including it's fair share of trials and tribulations. But what else can one expect visiting this unique region in the world, basically all of you should be here now!

cottage industry
rattan mat making by the five foot path under the canvas
Walking back from the restaurant, after a hefty meal, decided to take a walk down the streets of a small Indian vicinity, where I could see many shops, busy with people at the last minute shopping for groceries, getting their SIM cards, having a treat of Pani Puri by the five foot path whereby I have no guts to try, banana and corn sellers, and the rattan mat makers which I found it most interesting and unusual because this is supposed to be a cottage industry product. I thought BIG when product like this comes with skill involved. They have a canvas over their heads on the five foot path, making money with no rental incurred, working from morning till night, through rain and shine, having all three meals at the same place, just simply marvelous that made me smile with wonder. Yet they could do it in humility since the time they started. I guessed India is one place where you can do anything anywhere as they wish just to earn the humble living to feed the family.

I laughed most when I saw some cows waiting outside the Canara Bank with two Indians. Were the cows’ queuing for
the norm and the unusual clientele
cows and indians awaiting at the bank for banking transactions
the ATM? Certainly not, as there is no ATM machine at the bank. My mind became more naughty and cheeky, probably awaiting for the bank to open to do some banking transactions with milk and cheese. They are not cardholders, that’s for sure. This certainly is for good laughs.

Maybe Canara Bank should come out with slogans, “We Foresee The Banking Future”. “We Accept All Form Of Collaterals” or maybe “We Make Banking Easy”
