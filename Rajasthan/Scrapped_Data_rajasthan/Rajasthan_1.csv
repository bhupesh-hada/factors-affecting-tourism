Princess Ceremony with Spencer West
He is such an inspiring person who is driven to making a difference. Nothing stops him from climbing mountains to walking on his hands from Calgary to Edmonton. Such a pleasure getting to know him!
On July 17th, our group had the opportunity to experience the morning in a village in rural India. We got to witness and experience their everyday lifestyles and gain a greater outlook on our lives. In my opinion, this was probably the most beautiful and inspiring part of the journey. It is one of the main reasons why I decided to go to India and I'm so happy that I did.

Before going to the village, Ankita (our cultural facilitator) taught us about the caste system in India. For generations, the caste system has survived by being passed on by birth. There is no meritocracy where an individual can move up/down the caste system. It is also shunned upon to marry an individual from a separate class.

The caste system is composed of 4 distinct groups. The top of the hierarchy are known as the Brahmins-- the priests in society. Following that are the warriors/royalty, the middle class while the vast majority rests in the ""Untouchable"" caste. Specifically with the Untouchables, they are the bottom of the hierarchy and the most abundant in Indian society. They have very many restrictions such as not eating in public while the other
Diggin' in
castes above are eating. They also cannot come in contact with the other castes above or they must do a purification for the higher-class individual. It is also a growing fear that their children will not be able to have basic necessities and a proper education. It's hard to believe that such restriction of rights can be possible to happen to an individual. For some of the conditions, it almost feels like a degradation to individuals and their ability to live an equal and opportunities life Ankita had mentioned that because of the time that this caste system has been in place, the individuals may find that it is of their daily lives and accept that they have such restrictions.

The village that we are visiting belong to no caste at all. They are below the caste system and are considered scheduled tribes, similar to what we call First Nations. The First Nations in our country, however, receive government funding, proper necessities and opportunities to reintegrate and strengthen their own heritage/traditions. Those in India, like the village we are visiting (and Udawad), are isolated. They receive little to no government funding and it is of their duty to be

in ""conduct of shyness."" That means, they are seriously outcasts that who are shunned upon by public society. Just hearing this, it made it difficult for me to comprehend how I would be able to smile the way the kids smile at me if I knew about the lifestyle/class that I was in. In places like Canada, we have opportunities to better our lives based on societal standards(eg. income, possessions) but for these individuals, they are rooted in their class and cannot get out. It is like a wheel following the same route-- stuck in the already paved road with little to no chance of getting out.

The shanties and concrete huts were not too far away from the accommodations but the contrast of living conditions between those 2 alone were incredible. Plastered with almost little to nothing, this village is composed of a couple families, all living within a close proximity to a well and hills of fertile ground. Watching as the tour bus pulled up, all of them had their smiles in colourful saris, greeting us so nicely into their communities. From there, we were divided into smaller groups to tend to their activities. Around, there would
Village Children
be motorcycles stopping and watching us because it was the first time the community had ever welcomed such a large group of foreigners.

The first activity that we did was the infamous ""Water Walk."" With a woman and our translator, we walked to the nearest well only to find that the drought from the monsoon season had quickly dried up any sort of water for the community to use. The accessibility of water is so dependent on nature that it was amazing to see how so many families are affected. Walking with the woman, she told us how her daughter opted out of school in grade 5 to help her family tend to crops and carry water. From a distance, we went to a local hand pump that was made by a NGO a couple years ago. This made accessing water easier when there was no well but for many women, they do this walk about 4x a day with 2 large jugs on their heads. Pumping the water from the hand pump required a lot of force and placing it on our heads without completely breaking the porcelain jug was also a challenge. Being me, I kind of
Making Chapati
anticipated myself spilling some water here and there but I was completely wrong-- it was like a morning shower. I know I don't have the best balance but every step I took, some of the water from the jug would spew out. My glasses also kept slipping and every time I would fix it, the water would give it a nice cleaning. On the sidelines, girls that looked 10 or 11 were laughing at us in our attempts to carry the light jugs. When we finally reached the house, we dumped the water in huge basins. The water was muddy and yellow so the sanitation process was going to be a long one before it can actually be clean for the families to use. I probably dumped about half of what was in my jug on myself but experiencing that walk for myself was tiresome and very rewarding. To do that walk everyday 4 times a day with two large jugs-- I don't even know how they manage.

The second activity was chapati/roti making with a woman in her house. Taking off our shoes and stepping inside of her home, it was a dilapidated single-roomed home with concrete walls.
Plastered House
It was simple, small fixtures and dents within the wall were where the family stored their belongings like the jugs of water, pots and pans. In the corner, there was a small fire burning using the twigs from trees around the area. Her daughter fetched large twigs every morning and the woman crouched down making chapati after chapati. Chapati is typically what the family has for lunch-- it is like naan but made out of simple ingredients. We watched her work so diligently rolling the dough and pounding it onto the pan right above the natural fire. Looking around, there was no washroom but instead, canopies of twigs that held other storage. The home was one of the best homes in the community and all that was on the ground was a single blanket where they slept. We made some chapati with her. Grabbing the dough, rolling it out and placing it on the pan. The ambassador of the program said that everyday she does this for about 2 hours making her family food. Most of their meals composed of 30 chapatis and occasional pickled vegetables. After about 10 minutes, the smoke encapsulated the home which made it hard to breathe. From the back of the room, I had to step out a couple times because the smoke was so overpowering. As a result, the woman has lung complications from breathing in the smoke so often and for long periods of time. Free the Children has started to implement chilahs within homes such as this one-- it is like a chimney that will aid with the ventilation.

During this period, we also got to ask her questions about her life. She said that she was married off at the age of 16 and she now has 3 children. One of her children already has a family of his own, whereas the girls are hitting their teens and soon will marry. She says that everyday she wakes up at around 5 in the morning (before sunrise) to get water, twigs for the fire and prepare meals. Her children can be sent off to school where they will receive a meal at the facility but for her and her husband, she cooks and cleans before going out to the fields to work. The thing that hit me the most were these questions:

""Have you ever been to the city?""

""Yes, and it is very busy. There are a lot of buildings and rich people.""

""Would you ever want to live in the city?""

""No, I wouldn't change my life or trade anything to live there. I'm happy with how I live now.""

That answer almost made my cry. It made me feel so inspired by the strength women around the world have and the happiness they can have with the life that they have. It made me realize that for most individuals in the Western world, it's the materialistic wealth that drives us to what we believe is happiness. It's the amount of nice clothing,nice cars, big houses and number of zeros behind that paycheque that claim our smiles. Yet, somehow, we're still not happy. We keep wanting more. This woman who was in front of my eyes lives a simple, happy life. She made me reflect upon my own life and give me a sense of deep gratitude that I've never felt before. She made me realize that I'm beyond blessed to live the life that I have, and all of those ""wants"" that I thought were going to give me happiness really, at the end of the day, will just tempt me into wanting more. It's like a cycle of pure materialistic desires that most of us are caught into unknowingly, until we step outside our greedy temptations and understand the lives of others who don't need those things to be happy.

The last activity we did was rather interesting. We plastered the house with cow dung. Free the Children provided gloves (yay) and we dug in there and covered all of the cracks. It is considered to be a holy blessing/protection of the house from above so we had fun at our first attempt in plastering. Can't say I would ever be a construction worker but hey-- experience was cool. It was one of their infamous ""surprises.""

Today was an eventful day and it really did enrich my insight in women empowerment and lifestyles around the world. I'm so happy to have this opportunity and it was very rewarding!

Hampi
Karnataka


We stop by Bangalore on our way to Hampi (only briefly - it is not a nice place - it's a big dusty noisy and unappealing city, we arrived at night and left immediately the next day!!)

The bus journey from Trichy to Bangalore is 8 hours. We took a private company KPN. The rickshaw bring us to a recommended place (by him).Some rickshaw drivers can be trusted but you have to get lucky. Most will recommend a hotel who will give them a commission for bringing customer and you will see the price of your room increase! Bangalore is just a short stop for our next destination: Hampi.


16/08 to 22/08 : Hampi


We embarked on Hampi Island (Viripur Gadi) to settle down at Shanti Guesthouse for few days before moving to Shiva Guesthouse (recommended by friends).

Shiva is owned by Olgan and family. There we lived in a very basic way but which shows to us that you don't need much to be happy in life.

The volcanic landscape is a bit mad around here. Some talk about a magical and spiritual forces, others about aliens and some with a
Hampi
geographical explanation. (Indians believe the Monkey god Hanuman placed the stones in Hampi) Either way whether by nature or a Hindi god - the scenery is otherwordly....

As a World Heritage Site, Hampi is very green surrounded with the rice fields on one side and desertic landscape and Ruins on the other.

It is a good start to try to understand the Hindu religion and history about the country itself. We took the service of a Rickshaw-guide to visit the Ruins who explain the Hindu religion and the history of the place. We did learn that the Arabs conquered Hampi during 1635 and destroyed some sites and temple to build their own legacy: Queen's palace - Lotus Palace - Elephant Stables.

A lot of places can be visited on your own as to be honest the Hindu religion is a bit complex (more than 3 millions names - reincarnation, avatars and divinations to remember).

On Hampi island, we visited the Hanuman temple monkey on the top of the mountain accessible by a 570 steps climb.

There is a nice contrast of colors between the green of rice field and coconut and banana plantation and the
Hampi
reddishness from the arid landscape(lava stone).

The current situation in Hampi is difficult as they are destroying people's home built near or using part of the Heritage walls. The State want to restore the site as a World heritage monument. To enable them to do so and to have more visitors and more profit we expect, they move people away , give them a land (3km away from Hampi) and 130.000 Rupees. Of course for people who had a business, this may not be a compensation for the loss of profit but one can understand that some houses were at risk and it will have been not safe for any one to stay under some very old stones...

Hampi is definitively an interesting place to be, full of history and mysteries. We were looking for something original and authentic... this is it! Incredible India...

Lord Shiva 1
Years back in 2003 I saw this wall poster of a white Lord Shiva statue in one of the Kodak Shop in Puchong, Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing picture I ever saw and I asked the owner of the shop where about is this place. She said India. I don't even know this God at all or his name so it was kind of difficult for me to search him in the internet those days. I shelved the whole idea until in 2005 I decided to visit Batu Caves, Kuala Lumpur only then I recalled and asked the Indians around who actually he is. I have constantly wanted to know him, doing researches on him, Indian friends of old and new like to tell me stories of him. The more stories I hear the more I want to see this statue in India. And so it happens in 2011 just before my birthday.

On my first day in Bangalore I visited this beautiful statue of Lord Shiva. Shiv Mandir is the name. My driver swerved into a car park. I asked where we are going. He said “To Shiv Mandir, the Lord Shiva Temple”. “Do we have to walk
Lord Shiva 2
far?” I asked. “No” he replied. It was just a few feet away into an exit and there stood the same statue I last saw in 2003. Exactly the same. I didn’t realize the Total Mall and Shiv Mandir shared the same car park. Any foreigner would have missed this place if not for the help of the locals. Remember it is on Old Airport Road.

The temple reached its completion in year 1995 was set on an auspicious day Maha Shivaratri as the inauguration day. The Lord Shiva statue is 65 feet high with River Ganga flowing out from his matted hair. In 1997, the Mount Kailash was added as backdrop behind the statue making the whole scenario more magnificent. The first Linga was founded in Mount Kailash(Tibet). It contained a natural Linga. On the whole of India, there are six natural Lingas discovered in six different states that marked these temples sacred by the Hindus.

In the Shiv Mandir, I saw statue of Lord Ganesha, the Elephant God as The God of Wisdom, a gallery of the seven Lingas, a long narrow path with probably about 3 feet wide, dark, wet and cold, contained its history
Lord Ganesha
and some words of wisdom for those believe in Lord Shiva. I like one particular word of wisdom, hope and encouragement he quoted. “Faith has Magic - When doctors gave up hope, you should not. If you have health problem, have faith in God, He can solve it.”. I was thinking of people suffering from Cancer, HIV and AIDS the moment I read this. I believe everyone has their own beliefs and miracles do happen.

I am glad I made this trip to see this Shiv Mandir. In reality it was better than the poster. The feeling is so nice and calm, thinking of the founder who had a dream to build this temple was not easy for him. He has no money to buy a piece of land and to build this dream place. But it was God’s blessings all that came to place, one after another; part by part with new statues, the gallery and the artificial Mount Kailash that took so many years was finally paid off. During the Maha Shivaratri, thousands of devotees throng to this place for this auspicious prayer and celebration. Thousands came to visit this Shiv Mandir throughout the year. Thanks to
Gallery 5
people who wrote and post about this beautiful place.

Celebration? Yes, they should celebrate for having a place like this.

Aha...I'm a bit delayed in writing these next couple of posts. As the program progresses I'm getting less and less motivation, as it often goes with experiencing new things. At first it's really exciting and everything you do is new! and wonderful! and you want to use exclamation points to end all your sentences! But eventually you start to get used to things and don't try to learn as much. I think part of it, too, is that I haven't been able to get much exercise here so I'm losing my eternal endorphine high. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Anyway, back to actually reporting on the fun stuff. On Sunday we got the day off from hours and hours of lectures and got to go visit some sweet temples in Belur and Halebidu, Karnataka. Just as in our trip to Mysore, the bus rid was gruelingly long--a whopping 5 hours to get from our hotel to Belur. What changed, however was the space. Since a lot of people heard of the length of the bus ride and remembered the underwhelming trip that was Mysore (too much shuffling, not enough sights) a lot of them skipped out rather than get onto a bus at 4:30am. What this translated to was the entire back row of one of the buses--all 5 seats--reserved just for yours truly. So, of course, I went ahead and flopped my pillow down, plugged into my ipod and got ready for a few more hours of REM. Such a better ride than that to Mysore.

Not only was it a better ride because it was more comfortable, but the countryside was gorgeous. I slept for a couple hours then woke up to peer out the bus window. That part of India is mostly rolling hills, with coconut palm trees everywhere. I think most of the world's coconut product must come from there, because there were obscene amounts of palm trees. Sometimes off in the distance I'd see a rise of rock that could be considered an aspiring mountain, but mostly you could see to the horizon (over the palm trees, of course). I liked seeing this part of India much more than the cities, probably because I'm more of a country girl than a city girl. The towns were smaller, much more farms right up next to the road, and the occassional roadside food- or drink-stand. I really liked some of the houses we saw on the trip; the roof is usable as a patio and they have plaster outside that's been brightly painted so it looks wonderfully cheerful and nicely put together. Looked like a great place to come home to. Occasionally we'd pass through larger towns, that might be considered really small cities, but for a lot of the ride we were basically out in the country. I loved it, and really wanted to just get off the bus and go trekking (what they call backpacking) through the woods.

The main attraction in Belur was the Chennakesava temple. Because it is a hindu temple, you must take off your shoes before entering. Some leave them at the door, but rather than risk ours getting stolen we left them on the bus and walked barefoot from the bus to the temple. (Some of the other kids not used to walking barefoot had some trouble.) To be fully polite, you should also cover your knees and shoulders when entering the temple, but they seem to be a little more lax about letting foreigners in with shorts or tanks. The layout of the temple was similar to the one I saw at the Mysore palace, but on a much grander scale. Once you pass through the main tower-gate-thing you are confronted with an obelisk and a small statue that rest about 100 feet in front of you. I'm not sure what it signifies, but it must mean something because it's placed directly in your way in what otherwise would be a gigantic courtyard floored in stone blocks. In fact, pretty much everything except the doors are made of stone. That's what has made these temples so famous and attractive to tourists, is their stone carvings. And, honestly, I think they deserve the fame.

So, let me try and draw a map of this temple for you. The whole area it covers is roughly rectangular, surrounded by a stone wall about 10 feet high, sometimes higher in places. Let's say that the main gate is in the southern side of the wall. Then the obelisk and small statue are about 100 feet north of the gate. In the southeast corner there sits a ""tank,"" a 100ft-by-40ft green pool of water sunk about 40 feet down into the ground, with fish occasionally breaking the surface to grab a bug. Not sure what it was for, either, since the text on the sign had worn off to indecipherability. But there was a short wall around it and the entrance had a locked door so I figured I wasn't supposed to go closer. In the southwest corner there was an overhang that covered what looking like the makings of a parade in storage, wooden horses on wheeled platforms and suchlike, all painted gold, probably for some festival or another.

If you continue north past the obelisk you get to the main temple, a star-shaped stone-carved building that is elevated onto a star-shaped platform about 4-5 feet off the ground. As you climb the stairs to the temple you are supposed to touch them, to petition the gods to allow you to enter the sacred domain. The outside of the temple is covered, I mean literally covered, in stone carvings of the gods. There are thousands of hindu gods, if I remember correctly, and each one has bunches of incarnations as well. Some I remember, like Ganesh with the elephant head, and Shiva and Vishnu, but it would take a lifetime to remember them all. Our tourguide was very knowledgable, using a small hand-mirror to reflect the sunlight at a particular carving he was focusing on as he told us of the god-story that led to the carving. ""And here you see an incarnation of Shiva destroying a demon with just the fingernails of one hand, see how the carver made her fingertips pass through the demon's body and back out,"" or ""and here you see Ganesh lifting an entire mountain over his head, and you can see the hunter on the mountain and the farmer,"" and so on. An entire anthology of lore is contained on those wall, and it would be easy to miss without a guide.

There are three doors to the main temple building, two on the east and west sides (as I have designated, not sure of the true directions) and the main one on the south. The hallways from the doors converge on a round dais that is raised about 4"" off the ground. In the ceiling above the dais is a circular carved dome with more ornate carvings of the gods, and to the north of the dais is a small room where the priests keep care of the deities. People can leave offerings and take blessings there. The door was guarded by two incredible god statues that were carved from single pieces of stone, but carved so that the sprays of stone above her head almost look like lace, and it's raised up enough from the back wall that you can slip your hand beneath the stone and see your fingers through the many delicate holes. It's pretty nuts, the level of detail present in these temples.

I didn't stick with the guide for much of the Belur temple, because I hadn't found much use for our guide at Mysore and I wanted to try and interact with the local people at the temple and I figured that wouldn't happen surrounded by a group of foreigners. So, I wandered off and snapped photos of cool statues that I liked. My idea turned out to be successful, a couple times people (mostly children) would say ""hello"" to me and giggle when I smiled and said ""hello"" back. A duo of girls came up again after going through the hello-giggle performance and shook my hand, asking me something that I eventually construed to be asking my name, then where I was from, then my mother and father's name. After deciphering their accented english and answering their questions, they then asked for 100 Rupees, which set me laughing as I told them no. The way they asked it was really funny, because it felt like they'd been told stories about how foreigners were free with their money and wanted to see if it was true. They didn't badger at all like some beggars or vendors may do. They just asked, and then left when I laughed and said no. Another lady asked me where I was from, then wished me a good stay. And once you start taking pictures with people, man, there is no stopping. I saw a couple of boys trying to take surreptitious photos of Fae and I from around a corner, so I leaned over and mimicked a camera and asked if they wanted a photo. Of course they said yes, but what I didn't realize was that there were about eight more of them around the other side of the corner, so then I had about four rounds of pictures with two or three boys on each side. It's wicked fun, to have a lot of people asking for their picture with you. ;D

The other notable thing we saw at Belur was an engagement party! In the northwest corner of the temple there was a sort of elevated patio that was crowded with men and women, just sitting. I avoided it myself, not wanting to intrude on whatever was happening over there. Eventually I met up with Naveet, Sumedha, and Fae, and the two Indian girls explained that it was a wedding (we later learned it was just an engagement) and Fae wanted to go and see. Apparently it was okay, so we wandered up the steps and crowded near the back of people. The bride and groom were sitting on the floor in an open space, next to each other and both facing the crowd. They both had red dots on their forehead and there was some sort of ceremony going on as a women holding a plate with cups and a candle on it was passing in front of them, but I couldn't see what she did. Fae wanted to give her blessings to the bride and groom, so she got some advice from Naveet and permission from someone from the wedding party and went up to the front of the crowd. I stayed in the back, not wanting to draw more attention away from the bride and groom then I already had. Apparently, to give blessings at an engagement you sprinkle rice on the head of the bride and the groom, dip a finger in tumeric and press it to the center of their foreheads, then dip your finger in red and mark the same spots on their foreheads. I heard people laugh while Fae was up there, apparently she dipped her thumb in the red and pressed firmly to the groom's head, who leaned back in surprise, making it look like she had poked him very hard. I asked Naveet afterwards, and the proper way to do it seems to be to stick out your ring finger, using your thumb to keep your other fingers back, and dip the finger into the dye lightly and mark lightly. So if I ever make it to an Indian engagement, I'll be prepared. ;D

After the temple at Belur we hopped back on the bus and traveled a short distance to the Halebid temple. The temple was different from the Mysore and Chennakesava temple in that it was not surrounded by a gigantic wall, and there were grassy areas surrounding the temple that made it seem very peaceful. The carvings there were just as impressive as those at Chennakesava, if not more so. This time I stuck closer to the tour guide and got to hear more stories about the carvings of the gods. But, there's not much more to say that I didn't say above, so I can't embellish any more...

After seeing that temple we went to lunch at a local resort, where we got to have a tasty buffet lunch. I got to have my favorite dessert of all time, gulab jamoon. I can't remember if I've written about it before, but it is so glorious that it deserves some more words. Perhaps a poem. An ode. A sonnet. A thorough and solid declaration of my love for the deliciousness that is gulab jamoon (with ice cream) and for the man who first made it. Gulab jamoon is some sort of dough that has been rolled into a ball and then cooked in a sugar syrup until it has reached a level of tastiness that places it upon deity-status. It is usually served with ice cream, and if you are blind and get two scoop of ice cream with two gulab jamoon and a little extra syrup sprinkled on top you will see once again. If you are lame, you will walk. If you are deaf you will hear. It is that freaking good. They also had fruit trifle and stuff, but I don't really care about that. After that, we piled back into the bus to come back to Bangalore, with a stop for snacks and tea along the way. So, would I recommend Belur and Halebidu to others visiting India? In a heartbeat!

August 2nd 2012
Published: August 2nd 2012


Yesterday we got a day off from lectures and instead we got to go sightseeing! We woke up early and piled on the bus at 5am to take the ~200km trip to Mysore. In a car or on a motorcycle it probably wouldn't have taken too long, but on a huge trundling bus the trip there took around 3 hours. NOT my favorite way to spend the morning, but I'm pretty flexible about where I can sleep. And, in fact, I would have slept quite well on the bus since I smuggled a hotel pillow out and planned to prop myself up in a corner and snooze and drool until we reached our destination. (Okay, ""smuggling"" is a bit strong. I kinda just walked out with it...) But, there was something that I did not account for. The roads here have a lot of speed bumps, and they are BIG speedbumps. Add that to the fact that I was sitting in the back of the bus and you get quite a rough ride. The driver was relatively good at slowing down, so on most of the bumps you just felt your stomach and brain lift up but nothing big. One bump, though, left all of us in the back at least a couple inches off of our seats. Better than coffee for waking up, that.

Our first stop was in Mysore, outside of pit stops, was at the royal palace. I learned a lot of history of India on this trip, and much of it from someone other than our tour guide. I spent some time talking to Professor Sriram, who grew up in India, did his undergrad in Thailand, and is now professing in New York. He was a walking fount of knowledge, I tell you. But I digress! In the early days (before Indian independence) India consisted of a collection of states: Karnataka, Kerala, etc. The British didn't rule so much, as just trade with the maharajas and sultans. (Both maharajas and sultans are kings of a certain area, but I think one is muslim and one is hindi. I can't remember exactly. Google it if you're curious. :D ) The British provided the rulers with soldiers to enforce their authority, and in return the maharajas et al over-taxed the people and gave a large portion of that to the British. I'm not sure why, but India was rolling in dough back then, something about the country got them a lot of money. That's also why a lot of Indian artifacts are chillin' over in Britain right now.

So, you may ask, where does Mysore come into all of this? There is a palace there, a huge wonderful palace where the son of the last maharaja of Karnataka now lives. At some point they restructured the government to remove the political power of the maharajas, and so when the last maharaja died in 74 his son did not become the next maharaja, but remained a prince. And since the prince is in his late 50s and has no children it's not looking promising for the royal line. I don't think this prince is complaining, though. The last maharaja agreed to let the public tour a small portion of the palace in exchange for 20%!o(MISSING)f the fees acquired. That's a crap-ton of money, because that placed is jammed with tourists. Apparently the government is refusing to pay his son, though, and there's a case in court to figure out if the prince gets royalties from the tourism. (Ha, royalties, get it? 'Cause he a prince, and all.)

The palace is pretty grand, bigger than the Palacio Real in Madrid but a bit more worn-down. You can't wear your shoes in, so you get to put them into a bucket and prance around barefoot. Well, I pranced. But that's me. The floors were mostly tiled, apparently with tiles from England, with stairs of concrete near the entrance. The ceilings were plastered with colorful designs, and there was some beautiful stained glass from Glasgow. In fact, a lot of the palace features were imported from other countries. It was that fact that prompted me to ask Professor Sriram how these maharajas could afford such glamour, and that was when he started telling me the history of India. My favortie feature of the palace was a courtyard, about 25 yards wide and 35 yards long, near the center of the palace. There was nothing really interesting in the courtyard, no fountains or statues in the center, and we weren't even allowed to go in it as all the entrances were blocked by nets. But I really liked the feel of it. There was a small stair set at one edge of the courtyard, about 6 stairs or so, with statues of snarling leapords on each side facing inwards, and a spiral staircase on another wall up to the second floor. A breeze would occassionally come from the open sky above and ruffle the nets, or my hair as I leaned out the windows that lined the edges and it was really easy to imagine the maharaja standing on the stairs, surrounded by attendants and holding court between those two leapord statues. Also it looked like a great place for a bollywood dance scene. :D

The palace grounds also featured a hindu temple which I got to wander around in. There's a sort of entranceway into the temple where you leave your shoes--you're also supposed to cover your knees and shoulders in deference to the gods. The main temple sat in the center, a building made out of granite pillars with ridiculously ornate carvings at the top. The wooden doors to that temple were shut and locked, so I'm not sure what deity/cod/goddess resided there. There was another building with a pooja room near the back corner, and this one was open and accepting supplicants. You can walk into the small room, stand on a table covered in rangoli-like artwork and the preists (or whatever they're called) will wave some incence in front of the statue and offer you some sacred water to splash on your mouth and head. I did not partake of the ceremony, but we were with Professor Sriram and got to watch what he did. The priests offered a silver platter with a burning lamp on it, he put down some rupees (not sure how much), then they offered him the bowl of sacred water.

Part of the fun of Mysore was what happened outside the palace grounds. I mentioned above that Mysore is a huge tourist attraction. Well, there is nothing foreigners are better at than paying to much for useless junk. So there are all sorts of peddlars right outside Mysore, and they are aggressive. I wasn't interested in buying anything, and I knew the rules: stare straight ahead, ignore them even if they're in your way or your face, and give them no reason to think that you are interested. Don't justify why you aren't going to buy their things. Don't stop, just keep walking. I found their flutterings hilarious and soon enough they left me alone. Some of the other kids, though, showed a bit of interest and were BOMBARDED. Reggie asked a fan-seller how much one cost when going in, and the man even followed him when we were coming out. To get to the bus we had to get through a narrow walk of stalls, and we temporarily lost a lot of kids as we were inundated. After I got on the bus the first time we realized one of the kids from China was missing, and I'd seen him interacting with the sellers before and knew he wouldn't be good at just walking through them and saying no. And if I knew, then the peddlers knew. It's like blood in the water, and you know they'll buy something from you just to get you away. So I left the bus to go escort him back, trying to use my body to get in between him and the peddlars. It was super-fun, like being a body-guard. And even once we were on the bus they didn't stop! They stood outside our windows and waggled their products at us. Sam thought it was ridiculous so she started making faces out the window, much to their amusement. I thought it looked like fun so I joined in, too. Some fan-seller in Mysore has a picture on their phone of Sam with her cheeks puffed out and me cross-eyed.

We ate lunch in the basement club of some fancy hotel, and it was wicked. The entrance to the club looks like a barrel, then you walk into this short tunnel with lit crystal in the floor, and then you get to the club-turned-restaurant. They set up buffet tables on the slightly elevated dance floor, and there were tables and cars around the outside for eating. That's right, they had two cars set up with tables in the club. It was super-fun. The decor was chic-western, with black walls and blue LEDs to simulate the night sky. The food was super-tasty--six types of desserts! Pulab jamoon (I think, I can't remember the exact name) with ice cream, ""bread pudding,"" a fruit-casserole thing, some sort of fruit-pancake-pastry thing, and some tasty cookie-things whose name I can't remember. I didn't keep very good track of what I was eating--I was too busy snarfing it down and wishing I had a faster metabolism. I'm pretty sure I've gained at least 5 pounds on this trip already. Too much eating, not enough unicycling! But I'm not worrying about it since I'm only getting this chance for a limited amount of time. I'm also getting really good at eating with my hand properly--I've realized the trick is to scoop the food up with my four fingers, then slide my thumb from my palm towards my fingertips to flip the food into my mouth. I'm an Indian-food-eating pro, man.

After lunch we moseyed over to sultan Tipu's summer house, also in the Mysore area. The story behind that was interesting; Tipu did not like British sovereignty so he opposed them and fought. It didn't turn out so well for him, though. After winning one bought with the British they came back en force and razed the huge fort that used to be near the palace and killed Tipu. There are some impressive wall paintings in the summer house that depict the battles with the British (before Tipu was killed, I think) and other famous people that I really didn't pay much attention to. After that we hung out on the grounds for awhile, and that was quite peaceful. I met two new Indian guys, Surya and Sasi (whose name means sun and moon, respectively. they should be friends for life.), and chilled with them on the lawn. I think they weren't quite sure what to do with me; even though I ate lunch with them and Kiri and they smiled whenever I wandered around it looked more like one of the nervous smiles I see when people don't know what to expect of you here. I was nice, though, and didn't chatter or anything. Just sat and enjoyed the breeze and the wonderful weather they have in this part of India. Our last stop of the day was a collection of stores on the outskirts of town that were arranged almost like a city square. The complex was absolutely deserted, though, so it was obvious that our tour program had some sort of deal with the owners that they would bring in batches of tourists on a bus. I was a bit bummed; I had hoped for something like the insanity outside of Mysore. Ah, well. Can't win 'em all! After that, we piled back on the bus and made our slow way back to Bangalore. Fun day, in general, but I would have loved to tool around by myself for several days. Maybe I'll tour India on a motorcycle one day. :D

I can tell we're all getting tired of this break-neck pace, here in India. It's getting harder to convince myself to blog every day, which is why I've gone and missed one yesterday. Sorry everyone! But not really much happened yesterday, so there's not a whol lot to report. I convinced Bala to order me a ""cheese burst"" pizza from Domino's, non-veg. It was delivered to my room in less than 30 minutes just like they promised (I was really surprised) and was pretty tasty. The sauce is more BBQ than tomato, and the toppings are similar to a supreme pizza. The difference is the ""cheese burst"" part--they put a bunch of melty cheese between layers of crust on the bottom. It's pretty darn tasty, though ridiculously rich. I should not have eaten as much of my medium pizza that I did, but I finished the rest the next morning anyway.

Tonight we had a girls' night in my room, which meant snacks and Bollywood! Naveet has a super-nice hp computer with ridiculously good sound, so we set it up on a table in front of my bed, plopped into comfy positions and started watching! The movie in question is called ""Jab We Met,"" a romantic comedy from 2007. The story centers around an energetic, bubbly girl who meets a heartbroken guy on the train. She then gets all up in his business and, of course, hilarity ensues. We only got through the first half, but already the romantic sparks are starting to fly. (You see, it took that long because she has a boyfriend she plans to elope with. We haven't gotten that part resolved yet.) The male actor is good at brooding and occassionally flashing glimpses of teeth in a small smile while sneaking glances at Geet. One of the kids from China in my program, Chen, looks a bit like the actor, so it was a lot of fun comparing the mannerisms of the two. I'm eager to finish, though it will be a couple days.

Onto my second topic: women in India. Honsetly, I don't fully understand the complex dynamics that occur here. On one hand there is the traditionalist side of things. The large majority of women wear traditional clothing, like saris or (more commonly) kurtis with loose pants, leggings, scarves, etc. I've been warned not to wander the streets alone, though I'm moderarely sure I'd be okay before 11am. Women and men are not friends; I do not think I have seen a women and man walking the street together unless they were married. In Jab We Met, Geet gets stranded at a bus station and almost immediately starts getting harrassed by a group of men. The buses have trouble with men sexually harassing women. I read in the paper about a case in Mangalore (a city in the same state as Karnataka but pretty distant) where groups of young men considering themselves moral keepers gang up on people who are partying in the city, and probably harass women for wearing non-traditional clothing as well. The state's getting slammed because the officials in Mangalore are traditionalist-minded as well, and therefore are not as diligent about catching the ""goons"" as they could be. When I told Prakash that I drove myself to school he was surprised; even something that we consider as meaningless as driving could be an unusual privelage here. I don't fully get the picture of women in India, I need to ast Naveet and Sumedha for some of their experiences. And probably some of the Indian guys, too, since they see the other side of it. As a foreign woman I am in a unique position, since I can interact with both groups freely.

Whew! I'm tired. I think I've been fighting some sort of sickness for the last two days or so. Perhaps that sore throat that's been going around has caught up to me. I was doing really well up till recently but I think this lack of sleep these last couple days is what tipped me over the edge from 100% to 90%. I'm still fighting it and hope to get to bed soon so I can sleep and recover, but I had to write blog posts for the last three days since I've been so busy. I was supposed to do work for my advisor today, as well, but it took me this long to get the posts written that now I am just going to go to bed after this. Whoops.

Nothing very exciting today, no adventures, just an evening jaunt to a close restaurant named Al-Bek that I wanted to write about. I went with Tim, Sumedha, Naveet, Jeyandran, Prakash, Ganesh, and Hussain. The place was packed, but we got lucky and a table opened up about 5 minutes after we got there. Tim says it's been packed every time he's been there, and he's been there several times for dinner on varying nights. Like a lot of the fast-food restaurants on our street there are two floors, which is necessitated by the lack of real estate in the city. Things are much more spread-out in the states, there is space and areas and parking lots between buildings. Not here. And since they can't build out, they build up. So the second floor is basically a wide balcony with several tables that overlooks the standing area below.

We ordered several curry dishes and a couple noodle dishes, not to mention some roti (flatbread). I practiced eating like a proper South Indian, with my right hand only and no utinsel. I spooned some chicken fried rice onto the plate, topped it with some masala (sauce) from one of the dishes, mixed the whole thing up with my fingers and went to town. I'm still pretty bad at successfully getting the rice from the plate into my mouth without getting extra rice on my face or dropping it into my lap, but I think I did okay overall. I had a slice to drink, which was a good choice because some of the dishes were a bit spicy and Slice is the best thing to cut spiciness, outside of curds, which I didn't think they offered. After dinner I washed my hands and face in one of the washbasins they offer in South Indian restaurants, copying Sumedha by only rubbing my right hand by itself, not with my left, and copying Naveet by cupping water to wash and rinse out my mouth. I'm torn on how I feel about eating in a South Indian style. On one hand I love the idea of eating my food with my hands. On the other, I'm not sure if I like getting my hands messy. Then again, if you round off the meal with roti and then a napkin your hands come away surprisingly clean. And the washbasins are provided in almost all restaurants, even if a washroom is not.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Bannerghatta
July 28th 2012
Published: July 29th 2012


Some of you may ask, ""Why Jenni, how could you possibly have seen lions and tigers and bears at the ANCRiSST workshop you were supposed to attend today?"" Well, my dear readers, there are two likely possibilities. The first is that the workshop hosts decided to bring a menagerie at lunch to entertain us guests--not an unlikely scenario considering the immense hospitality I've seen here--and the second is that I skipped out on the conference. As you may have already guessed, I did indeed play hooky today! After talking late into the night with Bala, Hussain, et al. I heard their plans to skip out on the conference and go see some tigers at Bannerghatta National Park. Naturally I was thrilled at the opportunity to a) get some extra sleep, b) have another adventure in India, c) hang out with my new friends from various countries, and d) see some wicked-cool animals.

My plan was to sleep until 9:30 or so, since we were up until 2, but that didn't pan out. Unfortunately the front desk called around 8:30 to tell me the bus was ready and that they wanted everyone to get on it. Ooh, side-track here. Another example of how India is different from the U.S.: on the first day Dr. Ramaswamy, one of the main organizers, told us not to be late and not to miss the bus. The problem is that they count the number of people on the bus and they won't leave until there are either 50 students on the bus or they've called every single room. This means that, now that people have figured out that they can skip lectures and not really miss anything, we often end up waiting for at around 30 minutes on the bus. Just another example of what I am beginning to affectionately refer to as ""India time.""

Well, I didn't get my precious beauty sleep because of the hotel call and I was not really able to get back to sleep after that. So there was nothing left but to stagger up, take a shower and go grab some breakfast upstairs. I then hung around for awhile, watched some TV, and waited for word from Bala and Tim about when we were going to go see some giant cats.

We ended up leaving the hotel around 11:30am: Yuuki (nickname: Shimapu), Bala, Hussain, Tim, Rodrigo, and myself. Our method to get there was bus to the central transportation area, then switch buses to get to Bannerghatta, which I would never in a thousand years have tried without Bala. You see, Bala grew up near Bangalore (in Mysore, I think) so he speaks Kannada, the native language here. This makes him invaluable because even though the national language is Hindi, not everyone speaks Hindi. And Bala also speaks Hindi, just in case, so we had an excellent companion to chauffer us around.

The buses were a fascinating experience. Apparently there are three classes of buses: the cheap, the slightly-less-cheap, and the not-really-cheap. I think we took the middle-class bus for both legs of the journey on the way there, but honestly I'm not really sure. We just all gave Bala 100 Rs at the beginning and let him do all the talking. When we got onto the first bus I stood with the guys near the door, but before long the conductor tapped me on the shoulder and indicated a seat near the front of the bus. That's right, the buses are gender-segregated here. I'm not exactly sure how much of it is out of respect and how much of it is to prevent harrassment. I had read on wikitravel before coming that if a woman sits on a bench or a bus seat where a man is sitting, the man may get up to give you the whole seat, and that in that case the man is being respectful and not rude. But then Tim told me that he had read in the paper that there was a huge problem with men harrassing women on the buses here. I think it's also a problem for women walking at night, because when I talked about walking about a block to the hotel by myself the Indian guys I was with told me to wait and they'd walk with me. I'm honestly not sure if I'd get harrassed walking alone on the streets at 8pm, since I'm not Indian, but even if it was a possibility I wasn't really concerned. I mean, what could they do? If they tried to verbally harrass me I wouldn't understand since I don't speak Kannada or Hindi. If they tried to physically harrass me I'd knock them ass over teakettle since I am usually at least 4 inches taller and 30 pounds heavier. I waited, though, for they guys' peace of mind.

Anyway, back to the buses. I sat up front with the girls, occassionally accompanied by Shimapu who had to give up his seat anytime ladies came onto the bus. When people get on the bus they stand around until eventually the conductor makes his way to you, asks where you are going, then takes your money and gives you a ticket. You don't bargain for bus tickets, just like you don't bargain for food. In India, there aren't little bell pulls on buses to indicate you want to get off the bus. If you're a lady I suspect you make your way to the front door and tell the driver or conductor that you want to get off. If you're a man you whistle to tell the bus to stop. It's the same whistle Indian men need to develop if they want to stop an auto. Apparently foreigners can make do with waving their arm, but Indian guys need to whistle to get an auto to stop. I had heard that whistling is rude, and Bala had told me a couple days ago that they did it to call taxis or tease girls. So as I was sitting on this bus, facing backwards because that's how my seat was, I heard a lot of insistent whistiling and thought ""great, someone's harassing the blond chick on the bus."" I didn't want to encourage the person, so I insistently stared out the window. At one point I tried to sneak a glance around the bus to see if I could find out who was whisting at me and accidentally made eye contact with a man standing about halfway back. Of course I went back to staring out the window and of course I heard the whistling again after that. So then I did not bother sneaking glances inside the bus, I just stoically stared out. I even thought I heard someone giving the whistler a set-down in some non-English language because I didn't hear any whistles after that. But when I asked Bala--who'd been sitting in the back of the bus, facing backwards as well--at Bannerghatta if someone had been whistling at me on the bus he laughed and told me no. The whole time it was people whistling to stop the bus. Aaaaaaaaaand since I'd stared out the window I couldn't have known that. Whoops.

The trip to Bannerghatta took about 2 hours total because our second bus stopped at basically every stop. We started getting excited when could look out the window and see what looked like a forest. The park was definitely a tourist trap: there were food stands, kids selling bubbles, and a ferris wheel, just to name a few. We purchased tickets for the bus safari--about twenty people squished onto a bus that drives through the enclosures of different animals--for 210 Rs per person, which is a pretty decent price (about $4). We then walked over to the waiting area, which was a square area surrounded by a waist-high wall with a granite-topped bench to sit and a roof with clay tiles. After waiting for around 5 minutes we were ushered onto a green bus lined with two-person seats on each sides, with holes for cameras on the grates that covered the window. Somehow in the maneuvering it ended up that Bala, Tim, Rodrigo, and myself were in the front, and after awhile we got Shimapu and Hussain in the front as well.

As it turns out, this was no accident. Anytime we stopped to see animals, from the spotted deer in the beginning to the lions near the end, the ""guide"" (in quotes because he didn't do anything but accompany the driver) and driver would take our cameras from our hands and lean out the windows to take pictures for us. I ended up just laying back a lot, or looking at the animals with my own eyes rather than on my camera screen. It seems that this happens all the time, they seat the foreigners up front and take their cameras to take pictures, knowing that a lot of Westerners will feel guilt-tripped into giving a tip at the end of the safari. It's how Fae lost a bunch of money at the Mumbai airport: guys kept taking her bags and carrying them places without her asking, then indicating that she needed to give a tip. And Fae, being nice Fae, gave all of them 50 Rs tips, even if it was one guy carrying her bag and accompanied by three others. So it seems this is a common scheme: do something nice for the foreigners to make them think they are obligated to pay you. Obviously it's a good scheme and it works. That being said, I did not tip the driver or the ""guide"" at the end of the safari. Rodrigo did, though.

The safari started off with the more tame animals, like spotted deer, alligators, and some other hooved creatures, and progressed to more and more exotic. The first animals are all in one really large enclosure, since the alligators probably get fed and are unlikely to want to eat the deer. The bus then passed through a double-gate into the bear enclosure. The bears in this enclosure were sloth bears, and they looked kind of like shaggy black bears with dog-like paws and goofy muzzles. As soon as we got into the enclosure there was a bear right next to the bus, and a bit later one of them put his paws up on the side of the bus to sniff. I would guess that sometimes people feed the bears out of the bus and this one was hoping to get a snack.

After the bear enclosure can the lions, which were my favorite animal of the safari. I'm not sure I've seen a lion up close like this, and these guys are beautiful. Their heads are gigantic--as big as my unicycle wheel--and their golden eyes are rimmed in dark so that when they turn their heads to look at you it seems like they can see straight into your soul. One of them was pacing next to a gate that either held food or a lionness, and watching him pace back and forth was amazing. He was so quick, so powerful, it was exhilirating and I was glad the guide had taken my camera because it meant I could just watch him move. After that we saw Bengal tigers, then Siberian tigers, but to me they just couldn't compare to the lions. They're definitely pretty, and I definitely decided that anyone who hunted tigers should be slapped in the face with a fish, but I still liked the lions better. Though I did not get to see a pair of lions mate, as I did with the tigers, since I think they keep the lionesses in a separate enclosure from the lions until they choose to breed them. Nor did I get to see a lion take a bath, as one of the siberian tigers did when we were near.

Once the safari was over we wandered around to scrounge up some lunch. Bala bought two ears of corn from a vendor-lady, one had been boiled and one had been cooked over an open fire. Both were very good; the boiled corn was basically the same as in the states except for the tasty spice on it, and the fired corn had harder kernels, almost like unpopped popcorn but not quite. Tim and Rodrigo did not partake, fearing the possible digestive repercussions that could come of eating street food, especially with a 2-hour bus ride back to Bangalore. We ate lunch at a restaurant in the park, but I didn't check its name nor would I have likely remembered it anyway. I ordered chicken noodles, since it was something I'd never had before, and was a bit dissapointed when I got something similar to what I might get as chow mein in a Panda Express. Turns out the noodle dishes here are approximations of Chinese food, just like we have back home. So I know now to not eat the noodle dishes if I want something exotic. I did get a Fanta, though, which is popular there. In fact, the most popular sodas that you see offered everywhere are the main labels you'd see in America, like 7up, Pepsi, Sprite, Coke, but also Fanta and the delicious non-carbonated mango drink Slice. I think the carbonation is lower here, which I really like, and the drinks are in glass bottles that look beat up and are fun to drink from.

The bus ride back to the central transportation hub was much shorter because we picked a nicer bus that didn't make as many stops. Another nice thing about it was that it was not gender-segregated, so I got to sit with Bala and the other in the back. Once we got to the hub we took an auto the rest of the way, because it was peak traffic hours and a bus would a) take FOREVER and b) be ridiculously crowded. And that was just the first half of the day.

That night we went out with a couple of professors to The Tavern, a pretty nice bar inside the Inn at Museum Road. I think it was made for foreigners because it felt almost exactly like any nicer bar back in the states and also played American music like stuff from The Fray and Pearl Jam. I had a chocotini for the ridiculous (at least in India) price of 330 Rs post-tax and got to hang with everyone. Sumedha had us play a game, basically charades where you chose what you want to act, and it was a lot of fun playing with kids from all over the world. We even got a little nerdy, too: I pantomimed a mode shape with my hand which someone guessed correctly, and someone else tore up a napkin to show the finite element method and someone got that, too. It was really fun! And since most of the bars in India close around 11pm, I still got back in time to get most of a good night's sleep. :D

It only took two shopping trips, a trip to a back-alley tailor, and a couple hours of chaos but we finally got to wear our saris! It took the three of us (Sam, Fae and myself) a long time to get ready because we didn't know how to put on saris at all, of course, and Sumedha did not have much practice at getting them to look just right. I got to put on my sari first, and even though it took awhile we were able to get my sari fully assembled with just Sumedha's and Naveet's help. When we tried to get Fae and Sam set up, though, they couldn't quite get the whole thing arranged. Their saris were two-toned, which made it a bit harder to get it to look right, and the girls are shorter than I am so they had to tuck a lot of fabric into the petticoat. Faced with such complications, what did we do? Call up one of the ladies who worked down in reception! Since they wear saris every day we hoped that they could finish up Sam and Fae properly and, sure enough, in no time at all they had been transformed into Indian princesses!

So, a bit of description on the whole sari outfit. There are three parts to a sari: the petticoat, the blouse, and the sari itself. The petticoat is just a simple underskirt that has a string to tie near the waist and falls all the way to the ground. It is suposed to match the color of the sari exactly, but mine was a bit darker than my sari and seemed to work just fine. The sari usually has some sort of border on the edge, say a thick ribbon, to edge it off. When you buy a sari it will often come with a strip of fabric to make a blouse, which you then take to a tailor. The sleeves of the blouse have the same edging as the sari, which makes the whole outfit look really shmancy. The style of the blouse is basically a t-shirt that ends a couple inches below your breasts, and features either hooks in front or a zipper under the arm, and loops in the shoulders that snap around your bra strap to keep it properly in the blouse.

The sari assemblage starts with putting on the petticoat and the blouse. Then one edge of the sari is tucked into the petticoat over the right hip and wraps around the waist (towards the left hip first) to get one layer of the sari as a skirt. Then a length of the sari is accordion-folded to give a bustle of fabric that sits in the front. All of these bits are tucked into the petticoat, which is how the whole thing stays together. We also used a safety pin to keep the folds together. Once the bustle is tucked into the front of the sari, the length of fabric that is left over is taken up and over the left shoulder. You can chose whether to pin the whole bit of fabric up on your shoulder, leaving your shoulder bare and exposing a bit of midriff on your side, or you can just pin one edge on the shoulder and leave the rest of the fabric to drap over your arm and shoulder. Some women take the extra length and wrap it so it tucks back into the sari, which seems a practical way to wear it because then you won't have the extra fabric flowing around and getting in the way when you try to sit.

Just like any elaborate outfit, learning to move in a sari took a bit of work. Walking was relatively easy to pick up, since the skirts fall just above your toes. I did have a bit of trouble when walking uphill since your chances of stepping on the hem are greatly increased. And, of course, stepping on the hem basically guaranteed that you'd pull the sari out of the petticoat and would have to go to the washroom to rearranged yourself. Walking up steps or getting on the bus was excessively nerve-wracking because you need to grab your skirts and lift them to get up the step, and you can't lift your skirts too high or you look indelicate. Not only that, you have to be sure to grab ALL of the bustle and the petticoat, or you'll step on the sari and pull it out. I did pretty well in general, never stepping on the hem really badly. At one point in the evening I noticed my sari was falling out and I had to go fix it, but that seemed to be from normal motions of standing, sitting, walking, etc.

We were quite the sensation. I am used to standing out, I mean, you don't see many 6' tall blond girls dressed in guy shorts and tanks very much in India, so I got used to people looking at me. This was nothing like that. As soon as the three of us reached the lobby of the hotel everyone looked at us, and I could feel it was a different look. When you're foreign, people might look at you and see your foreign clothes, but it's not an excessively interested look. These were interested looks. There are a group of Indian guys staying in our hotel for some medical conference and we had the attention of every single one. Our auto driver complemented me (through Naveet) saying that many foreigners dressed in jeans and t-shirts and it was nice to see one in traditional Indian clothing. He then looked at me in the rearview mirror, smiled and said ""very nice."" In fact, we got that reaction from a lot of the Indian men in service positions, like waiters and such like. Always a ""very nice"" and a smile. I smiled back and said thanks every time. Luckily for me I have no problem being the center of attention, but Sam was really shy at the beginning and even hid from pictures! She got better, though. :D

As it was, the evening didn't end with the banquet. Some kids from the k-mob (Korea) brought some liquor from Korea, called soju, so after ditching the sari (which was not good for lounging) I hung out with them and kids from the i-co and j-crew in the hotel room next door. I can't really describe the taste of soju, since I only had a little. Mostly I was drinking Kingfisher beer that we swiped from the minibar and will replace...eventually. That's one nice thing about the general disorganization of India--it's easy to do things like drink from the minibar and replace with stuff you buy at the market later. ;D Once the group in Yuki's room had winded down, a core group of us relocated to a different room to continue hanging and chatting. I got to ask Hussain about Islam, and he talked about the Koran and Ramazan and the comparisons between Christianity and Islam. They're about 1/3 of the way through Ramazan right now, which means that Hussain can't eat or drink from sunrise to sunset, which is still mind-boggling to me. My friend Sabreen had done Ramazan (though she called it by its arabic name Ramadan) back in undergrad and I was impressed then. We were up really late just talking and exchanging stories, and I think that it's been one of my favorite experiences so far.

I am very tired today; staying up so late blogging is not good for me! After lectures us girls and Gift (pronounced ""jift"") and Duan went to pick up our saris from the tailor and buy some accessories. I got earrings and bangles, and will be wearing my dress sandals that I bought. Apparently it's going to take 2 hours for us to fully get ready so we're going to ditch the entire afternoon workshop session to have time to prepare. Don't tell on us, 'kay?

I'm going to go to bed now--it may only be 9:45 but I need my sleep and the bus leaves at 7am tomorrow morning (ugh). 'Night.

July 25th 2012

Eventually there will be a day when nothing really out of the ordinary happens and I'll have to resort to summarizing little things that I've noticed here and there but haven't really been able to fit into any other post.

Today is not that day.

The first half of the day was pretty normal. Exact same breakfast buffet as described earlier (except I tried watermelon juice). Lectures weren't excessively noteworthy except for the fact that our second lecturer ran 40 minutes over because he had gotten the wrong stopping time. I got to unicycle during lunch, yay! My hand pump to inflate Tweaker broke while I was trying to inflate the tire--not surprising since I paid only $2 for it plus shipping--but Keshav's friend had an air compressor in his car so I was soon tooling around near the courtyard. I think I'll be able to work on some flatland there, which is good since I can't do any flatland tricks (yet).

What made the day awesome, however, was that our last lecture of the day was cancelled. Not only did this mean that we were freed of a 90-minute lecture, but that Fae, Sam, Naveet, Sumedha and myself were able to go shopping for saris. So off we headed to Commercial Street, via auto of course, to see what fun stuff we could buy.

We wandered into a jewlelry shop first, allured by the sparkles and shinies. I tried on a cool pair of turquoise earrings that loop over the shell over your ear and dangle down the back, and Fae tried on a jewled headpiece. I was surprised that we could just take the earrings off the wall of the shop and try them on and put them back, since that would be considered unsanitary in the states and the stores wouldn't allow that. We then remembered that we needed the saris before we could accessorize, so we wandered down the street until we found a shop that looked promising.

The shop was full of women, so you know that it is a popular place to buy clothes. There were bright red signs everywhere ""Buy 1 Get 1 Free"" and ""50% Off,"" but also ones that blared ""Beware of pickpocketers."" I kept my purse on my hip, where I could see it, and laid a hand on top to be doubly-sure. I was carrying enough to money to buy a sari (about 5000 Rs) and the last thing I wanted was to lose that. Especially since I had borrowed 2000 of them from Sam since I didn't have enough cash on me.

We looked at saris there, but nothing really caught Fae's or Sam's attention and I had no clue what I was doing, since my head was in the clouds. Both literally and metaphorically. I am taller than all the women in India, at least all that I've seen, and a large majority of the men. But I guess that's true in America too. But I digress. Saris are long rectangles of cloth that you wrap around you in such a way that you feel like a princess or a goddess come down to grace the poor earthlings with your presence. They were folded and stacked on shelves behind a large counter. You walk up to the counter and skim, looking for one you like, then point and ask an employee to lay it out on the counter. You can then examine it and see if you like the pattern. In that first shop we went to they catered more to the everyday people, so you didn't get to try on the sari. We wandered to the back of the shop to look at kurtis, which are Indian tunics that can be worn over leggings or jeans. I found two that I liked for 324 Rs each (under $6) and bought those. I wanted to buy a pair of leggings there to go with, but they didn't have a good color.

Once we finally got out of that shop (we all kept looking at kurtis) we wandered down the street again until we saw another sari shop. This one obviously was not just for everyday saris as it was completely empty when we came up. In this place the saris were hung on hangars instead of folded on shelves. One sari immediately caught my eye, a turquoise with silver dots and maroon trim. The shop owner told us we could only try on a sari if we were likely to buy it, so after dithering for a bit I asked him to try it on. First he wrapped a loop around my waist and then pinned it to itself to keep it up. Then a large length of it is accordian-folded to make extra fabric in front that swishes and flicks while you walk and makes you feel glorious. Finally, the length that is left is brought up over the left shoulder to round off the goddess look. I can't wait to wear mine for reals.

The sari itself set me back 1690 Rs (~$30) but I still needed to buy an underskirt (called a petticoat) and a blouse. It turns out that the sari fabric came with extra fabric that they use to make a blouse, assuming you find a tailor. At the time I figured it'd be easier to just buy a blouse ready-made, so once I'd purchased my lovely new sari we continued down the road to find Sam and Fae something, since they hadn't found anything yet. Fae was looking for something very similar to a sari she'd tried on the day before the program started, but with a smaller pricetag, and Sam just hadn't seen anything she liked.

The next shop we wandered into because they sold petticoats, which I needed for my sari. Since the sari is sheer the petticoat is supposed to match exactly, but they didn't have a shade that matched so I just went for a sort of forest green that would work under the fabric (cost: 195 Rs = $3.50). They sold leggings, too, and I found a pair that would work with my kurtis but when they named a price of 350 Rs I laughed and walked out. I know nothing about shopping, especialy in India, and even I knew that was ridiculous!

Our next shop ended up being out last sari shop. Called WoW!, which stood for World of Women, it sat on a neon-lit street packed with nicer shops. The saris were folded and on shelves, like the first shop, except that they were stored in plastic packets to keep them neat. The overall feeling of the shop was more high-end than that of the second, and way more high-end than that of the first. After viewing several saris, Sam decided to try on a golden yellow one that ended up looking GORGEOUS on her. Fae was still comparing everything to the one she had tried on a couple days ago, but she pulled out a red one and a magenta one to try. I was interested to see that in this shop the lady helping Fae with her saris offered her opinion on the choice of fabric color, and I was happy that my opinions coincided with hers in terms of color choice. Fae ended up buying the red one, but both looked wonderful, and hers and Sam's saris ended up both costing around 3000 Rs each (~$53). The shop had a tailor who worked nearby come over to arranged making the blouses out of the extra sari fabric, so I ended up just adding my sari to their order, which is how I'm getting a tailored blouse.

After Naveet and Sumedha haggled with the tailor to get us a better deal, the tailor led us to his shop about two blocks away that was tucked into a sketchy back alley that made us a bit nervous when he first led us down. The shop was about 10"" deep and 6"" wide, with four men crammed in over sewing machines. The tailor and another man talked to us over the counter in the front, took our measurements, and asked whether we wanted hooks in the front or zippers under the arm. Sam and Fae chose the zippers, but I thought that might get scratchy if your arm rubs it so I went for the hooks instead. They also offered to hem my sari properly for 75 Rs so I threw that into the bargain. Then we realized we wanted to wear these to the banquet tomorrow night so Naveet and Sumedha had to heckle to get him to finish them on time. When he finally acceeded I was surprised--wouldn't it cost extra to get a rush job? Sure enough, when the bill came he had added extra charges and the two Indian girls had to heckle (again) to get him to drop the price a bit.

With that business completed we decided to find some grub. We quickly stopped in a last shop to buy leggings for me, and Sam tried on some wickedly ridiculous harem pants that looked like they were made for the circus. When we found an auto he told us he'd take us anywhere close for free, as long as we'd go to a shop afterwards for only 5 minutes. Apparently the shop had a deal with the auto driver that if he got people to go to the shop for 5 minutes they'd give him a coupon for 100 Rs and a t-shirt. Well, who's to turn down a free ride to dinner? Especially when he'll wait while we eat then drive us back to the hotel after we visit the shop.

So we went to a super-tasty, super-cheap restaurant in the Kamat Hotel (I think. I didn't write the name down, which is a pity.). We ordered three curry dishes--paneer tikka masal, abu gobi, and malai kopta--for around 100 Rs each ($2), a plain rice dish for 20 Rs ($0.40), and roti (which is basically pita) for less than 100 Rs ($2). I ate first with a spoon, then with roti, and finally fingers. As it turns out, you're allowed to mix your curry and rice together with your fingers and scoop it into your mouth with your hands. When I saw Sumedha eating like that I immediately wanted to try. It's like finger painting, but with food! We also had sauf at the end of the meal, which is a collection of seeds that you and eat as a breath freshener. Tasted a bit like licorice.

Before we could head back we had to head to the auto driver's contract shop. Turns out it sold a variety of Indian goods, like scarves, sandalwood, incense, jewellry, knickknacks and trinkets. I didn't buy anything, since I was shopped out and also hadn't figured out what souveniers I wanted to get for what people, but Fae bought a cool scarf and Naveet and Sumedha bought gems for themselves and their fiancees. Something really funny happened in the shop: I kept looking at a variety of trinkets as possible souveniers for people but with no intention to buy. One of the workers was shadowing me and anytime I expressed interest in something he'd rattle off words about how good it was, etc. And then I'd ask for the price, he'd tell me, and I'd say ""thanks"" and walk away. When we were in the jewellry room he showed me a box of bracelets and said 300-400 Rs. Of course I wasn't interested, but what was funny happened later. As we were just trying to leave the jewellry seller roped Fae into trying on a bracelet from the same box. His price to her for the bracelet? 600 Rs! So I guess it's worthwhile to not be interested in anything for a bit, then take them by surprise. :D

We had a scare on our auto ride home. Just after we had left the curio shop I thought our auto driver was acting strangely, driving slowly and waiting for the other auto with Sumedha, Fae, and Sam to catch up, then following slowly. A bit later both autos turn down a side street, then down a steep ramp into the parking garage of some building, where they parked and turned off their motors. I was a bit nervous because Naveet was a bit nervous and she was asking the driver to ""just take us to our hotel."" I ducked my head to see out the auto better and saw two men nearby standing next to an elevator. So that made four men, vs. us five girls. I was figuring if I should get ready to bolt when one of the men went to the first auto, handed a business card, then came to our auto and gave me a business card. Turns out these guys just worked for a silk seller and their method of getting business was for shopping foreigners (and perhaps Indians as well) to make an unscheduled stop. After we vehemently expressed a lack of interest, our auto drivers took us back to our hotel like good little boys.

We tried on our clothes in Naveet and Sumedha's room; turns out one of the kurtis I bought was too small and one of Fae's was too big, so we switched. My other was also too small, but we're taking it to the tailor tomorrow when we get our saris back and I'm getting strips put in the side to make it a bit wider. I'm also going to have him make the armholes in the other kurti bigger. My biceps are just too buff, you know? All that iron I pump all the time. ;D

This post might be a bit shorter than the others as I am pretty tired and my A/C has decided to go on the fritz. I talked to the front desk and they sent someone up, but unfortunately he and I couldn't communicate. It's terribly frustrating, since I was talking to some of the guys from India on the bus perfectly fine, yet I just couldn't grasp the what this man was trying to say. He did say something about it being cool for 5 minutes, or something, but i just could not understand what he wanted from me. And I think he was frustrated that I didn't understand him. So I have no idea if/when they'll fix my A/C. 😞

The day started out a bit earlier than I expected: my 7:30am wake-up call came at 6:40am. Fae said this happened to her as well, so we're not sure what went wrong. It's kind of a common theme here. Well, not things going wrong, exactly. It's a bit hard to explain. To me it feels like everything here is on the verge of falling into total chaos, but things are barely held together by metaphysical tape and the chaos only shows through now and then. Like my bag being lost, and eventually delivered, but damaged. Or dealing with auto drivers (I asked the Indian guys, and that's the way to refer to auto-rickshaws in short). Or getting things fixed, like my A/C. It won't necessarily happen quickly, and I suspect there's no way to know when it will be fixed. It's a different feeling from the states, where everything is very regulated and controlled. You know when you get your food, when the repair-man is coming, when your wake-up call is coming, etc., and if something goes wrong it's cause to complain vigorously. I suppose you could complain for the same things here, too, but it would get you nowhere. Lucky for me I'm pretty easygoing so this is all part of the fun.

The buffet breakfast was the same as yesterday, except that the dubious french toast was replaced with pancakes. Which actually looked like pancakes and tasted similar to pancakes. Oh! And there was fresh-made grape juice, which I've never had before. IT IS DELICIOUS. I wanted to steal the whole pitcher.

I had to bring my duffel back to IISc today because a friend of Keshav (an awesome guy who's been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work with the program) said he could get my bag repaired. This meant that I had to lug both the bag and Tweaker onto the bus, which was less than stellar. I tried to ride Tweaker during the lunch break, but I didn't inflate the tire nearly enough and had a huge problem just riding straight. Hopefully I'll do better tomorrow with more air. I'm not sure if practicing on the street where I was will work, since it's still driven on occassionally but I'm going to keep trying. Perhaps a bit of exploring will lead me to a spot that will work.

My favorite part of the day was a cultural lecture we had in place of our fourth professor lecture. A lady gave a presentation on the art of Rangoli, which I had no clue existed before she told us about it. Rangoli is artwork that household women do on the pavement between the gate and the house every morning. Mrs. Pradash (I don't think that is her name but I have to call her something...) said that it's one of the first things women do in the morning. After waking up and perhaps boiling mint, she heads out to sweep the front yard, then cleans it with water and cow dung (since cows are sacred this serves as cleansing and purification), then create the Rangoli design in some sort of powder on the ground. Mrs. Pradash also talked about making Rangoli designs on a completly full, completely settled container of water, but I think the design on the ground is the most common. The designs are done every day, unless something terrible has befallen the family such as a death or serious illness. It's even a bit of competition among the different households, who can have the prettiest Rangoli. Kind of like husbands and yards back home.

The name Rangoli comes from the Sanskrit word ""Rangavalli"" which is a joinging of the words for color (ranga) and rows of color (avalli). The designs are often inspired by nature, and they are meant to block the negative energy outside of the house and only let in the positive energy. For you nerds out there I think of it as a ""good-pass filter."" :D The story she told us about the history of Rangoli is that a high priest of a long-ago king lost a son, and the king drew an image of the boy and asked Brahma, the god of creation, to bring life to the drawing. In addition to the front yard, Rangolis can also be found in the pooja room (the room where the gods reside) in the house. There are also Rangolis for festivals, different ones for each festival, and the festival begins with Rangoli.

Rangoli can be made with a variety of materials and a veriaty of patterns. The designs made of powder can be made of rice powder, crushed colored chalk, crushed limestone, or even crushed brick for red. Mrs. Pradash showed us pictures of Rangolis made in flowers, from the petals of flowers like crysanthemums and marigolds, and she had several designs she had made out of things like beads, plastics, glass fragments, or fabric. She'd even made a Rangoli pattern on a coaster with puff paints. When I asked to see it at the end of the talk, she told me I could keep it. It's sitting next to my bed, now, to give me good dreams! My favorite style of Rangoli was not the really elaborate patterns, like the peacocks and sunsets, but the geometrical dot and line Rangoli. To see the difference between the elaborate and the geometrical, trying google-imaging ""rangoli"" and then ""dot rangoli"" and you'll see what I mean. She even gave us pencil and paper and had us draw the most basic dot Rangoli. I couldn't get my proportions right but I had a lot of fun. 😞

Rangoli is traditionally done by hand, but Mrs. Pradash showed us several gadgets that are available to help women make their Rangoli faster since they may have more responsibilities now that just staying at home. One was a tin cylinder with holes punched in a pattern; you filled the cylinder with sand then rolled it over the ground, leaving a line pattern. Another was a container with four holes that you filled with sand to help you draw parallel lines. She even showed us Rangoli stickers, for the truly busy.

After the lecture we hopped back on the bus and came back here to the hotel. I didn't eat my wrap from lunch, so that is going to be my dinner. Not only does that mean I get to earn a bit of money off my per diem, it means I get to just stay in my room and veg out tonight. I'm pretty excited. What's even better is that as I was writing this post I had a couple times where the electricity in my room went out. I think it was a black out--apparently they are common here, along with brown outs and grey outs--since my internet bugged out at that time, but the best thing is that my A/C is working now! Yay! And I see that my post is just as long as my previous ones, so I guess I muscled through this one just fine. 😊 Until next time!

errrrr
Bonjour mes amis,

I'm going to attempt to fit about a week's worth of adventure into one entry (Wednesday 7/11-Thursday 7/19). Since work has started I've been a bit burnt out... My schedule has been irregular because of a long Friday night and several early work mornings. Here's my attempt at relaying nine days worth of events:

Let me start with some advice I received from my boss before I left: to state the obvious, being gay in India is not like being gay in NYC (duh). I was told, essentially, to leave out some key details of my personal life so as not to let the proverbial cat out of the bag. This advice was given from the heart; my boss wanted to ensure that my work would be judged on its merits and not by what my teammates perceived my character to be because of my sexual orientation. I took this advice very seriously; I want this exercise to be as smooth as possible.

Now, as you may or may not know, for the first eighteen years of my life, it was regular practice for me to leave out key details of my personal life to keep that rambunctious cat in that tiny, shrinking and ever-less efficacious bag. But after being out for six years, and building a life based on being out, this advice was more easily received than executed. My first night out with my team (which kept me at a house party until 4:30 am) was filled with a ton of awkward advice from my colleagues... Apparently, my hair, glasses, and socks all point to homo in the eyes of twenty-something Indians (and probably most twenty-somethings around the world). So, after a few drinks, a few were comfortable enough to spill the beans: for sure, American style is different than Indian style; but for God's sake, I'd better be more careful, else folks might think I'm actually gay! But, not to worry, they can tell me how to avoid that. The key to success in this endeavor, I was told, was to never, under any circumstances, wear pink socks (really?). That, mes amis, is the dead giveaway (insert traumatized emoticon here). So... what did I do in response you ask? I evaded their questions on girls, graciously acknowledged their advice, and wore pink socks on Monday. Yee-haw!

Ok, so that was Friday. I'm going to skip over Saturday and Sunday for the most part. Highlights: I slept until 6pm Saturday evening (which ruined my schedule) did a very NY lounge with other folks in my program, Amy, Hannah, and Jennifer (these are not their real names; they asked for pseudonyms in the blog), and did brunch with the same group on Sunday.



Do you feel rested after the weekend recap? I hope so, for more, yes more, drama is on its way.

Let me continue with my journey for passport photos, and my SP rickshaw driver who went rogue on my ass. At the suggestion of a friend, I went to a shop a few blocks away for photos I would need for FRRO registration (see: Papers Please). Getting a rickshaw there was relatively easy, and the driver was a very pleasant man. An old lady even helped him with directions, unsolicited! I tried to pay him to wait for me outside the shop, but he was too busy (doing what, not sure). So I tipped him for his troubles and we went out separate ways. Feeling confident from that interaction I pressed on to get my photos. I accomplished as much without a hitch (other than looking awkward in my photo). Ay, but the hitch was yet to come. On my return trip, feeling that the universe was on my side from the tip I gave my last driver, I was confident that getting home would be as easy. Silly me.

After fighting with my first two rickshaw drivers because they were trying to fleece me, I settled on the third, who was charging just as ridiculous a rate (30 rps ); if they were going to steal from me, at least they were all stealing at the market rate. Most rickshaw drivers don't speak English, have probably never passed a driving test, and certainly don't know where they are going. This poses a bit of a logistical issue for someone not familiar with the city. Long story short, the motherfucker dropped me off about three blocks away from my hotel and did it with attitude. If I were in any Western city, navigating those three blocks may not have been a challenge... But getting around in a 12th Century city with 18th Century infrastructure and 20th Century automobiles and 10 people per square foot is a bit of a task. Thank God I had emailed myself a map cut out of a 10 block radius around my hotel. By the time I found a road sign and mapped myself a route, what should have been a three minute walk turned into a twenty minute adventure. I wasn't so much scared while I was walking around, half aimlessly, half intentionally; I was more so frustrated. It's tough when you lose at a game that you still don't know the rules of.

To wrap up: that same day my expat security briefing was scheduled with the head of security for Asia. His main points: taking rickshaws is dangerous and dumb (everyone ignores this advice; if only I had gotten it before Sarah Palin dropped me off on the wrong block), tens of thousands of people die every year on Bangalore's roads due to automobile related accidents, and if I am not careful, I will wind up getting hit by a car, laughed at by locals, washed into a storm drain by a monsoon, and left to die. Apparently this man has even more of a flare for dramatics than yours truly, but that is his job.

If that last paragraph made you anxious, rest easy; I practice all the safety precautions, and the firm has a strong presence in the city. If anything goes wrong, they'll have my airlifted, or whatever. I'll be fine!

Until next time,

TR

July 23rd 2012

Today was another solid day in my Bangalore trip. It started out quite early, around 4:30am or so, because my body still hasn't quite adjusted and decided that it had had enough sleep, thank you very much. I actually wasn't tired because my brain had gotten into the habit of sinking straight into deep REM the instant I fell asleep (thanks to excessive sleep dep.) so even though I only slept for less than 5 hours I was awake. Around 4:40 or so the islamic prayer came over the outside loudspeakers--a man's voice in a wailing, ululating cry that echoed a bit eerily around outside. Not that I really heard it over the howling dogs. Yes, that's right. People who have been here for a couple days inform me that every morning around that time the prayer comes on and the dogs howl with the singing. Right now I find it hilarious. In a couple days, I will probably hate it. In a couple weeks I may be able to sleep through it!

Breakfast was served on the fourth-floor Kebab restaurant, buffet-style. There was a large variety of food and, of course, I tried to eat as much of it as I could. I had a pinwheel-shaped baked good, a slice of white bread studded with candied fruits, some sort of cold noodles, ""french toast"" (more like flatbread with a thin coating of egg), vada with sauce (savory fritter with chives shaped like a donut), idly (pronounced ""id-lie"" it's this kind of salty sponge-like cake-thing made of rice and lentils) with coconut chutney, a brown-style omelette with no cheese and some chives and tomatos in the egg, a boiled egg, and, last but not least, I tried my first cup of tea. I'm not sure what kind it is specifically, I asked our Indian friends and they just said it's tea, but it's served with milk and adding two lumps of sugar made it delicious. It almost tastes like they added cocoa to it, but I don't think they did.

After breakfast we piled into the bus to travel to the Institute of Science's campus. Day 2 and I'm already getting used to the driving methods here. It's rather strange, but the rules make a lot of sense to me. It reminds me of swarming ants and large flocks of birds. On the surface it looks like chaos, but when you get down to it there's no collisions between people. It's just like cooperative control and rigid formations. Then again we were in a large bus and people had to navigate around us. Things were still sketchy when viewed from the back of an auto-rickshaw (details below).

The schedule today dictates what almost every day is going to be like for us for the next week and a half: two lectures in the morning, with a break for tea, then lunch, then two lectures in the afternoon, with a break for tea, then a bus back to the hotel where we scrounge our own dinner. The teas and lunch were served in a small courtyard right next to the lecture room. A small courtyard that was also inhabited by...monkeys. Patrick and I had had a conversation earlier in the trip about how we'd both heard we weren't supposed to touch dogs, cats, or monkeys since there is a large rabies epidemic here. We'd laughed at the last. I mean, really, what were the chances we'd be anywhere near monkeys? Turns out, pretty high. These monkeys looked similar to Jack the monkey from Pirates of the Carribean, except they were a bit bigger on average, about the size of cats, and were all grey. The alpha male was the biggest of all, maybe about the size of a medium-small dog. All of them had tufts of hair that made them look like they were wearing toupees.

The lectures today were really good, all topics that I am familiar with and like. The first was an overview of structural dynamics, then wireless sensing and digital signals processing, then experimental modal analysis and finally system identification. I really wanted to pay attention in the last lecture, as he was discussing the theory behind wavelets and some system ID techniques I didn't know, but jet lag hit me hard and it was all I could do to keep from literally passing out. At one point I fell asleep and did a head-bob, with my eyes wide open and staring at the screen. It did not help that my bag had been delivered and all I wanted to do was shower, brush my teeth, and change my clothes.

That's right, my bag was delivered today! Some of the program guys have been really awesome in keeping in touch with the baggage people, so they delivered the bag to me at the lecture hall and I got to sign for it and regain posession of my bag right then and there. Unfortunately the bag did not come through unscathed. There's a zippered panel on the bottom side that hides some backpack straps, and somehow that zipper was torn completely off the bag. The plastic handle on the bottom side is also broken. But the program guys are so awesome, they've told me to bring the bag tomorrow and they'll get the zipper fixed. I think the handle's out of commission, though, but I don't use that one so it's okay. But this is a good lesson for travelers to India: be prepared for damage to your baggage, and possibly the contents within. Especially bags like mine, which have several straps and buckles hanging off it.

My best adventure for the day commenced after returning to the hotel, showering, and changing into some new clothes (FINALLY). The title? AUTO-RICKSHAW DINNER ADVENTURE! A group from the American contingent (Reggie, Samantha (Sam), Fae, Patrick, Chungzhao, myself, and Jim) and Nick (the Swede attending a university in Japan) decided to go out to dinner to a restaurant called Oye! Amritsar based on Sam's Lonely Planet book. Of course, to get there we would need to be driven, and what better way to get around the streets of Bangalore than in the wonderfully comfortable, uber-safe backseat of an auto-rickshaw? So we split up into smaller groups (I rode with Nick and Sam, all the blonds in one rickshaw!) and all found ourselves some rickshaws. Jim, Sam, and Fae had all taken an auto-rickshaw around yesterday so they knew how to go about it properly. Here's what I've learned based on our experience:


• They are wicked fun and exhilirating to ride in.
• Stop panicking. The driver knows what he's doing and you'll be fine. Probably. Even if he pulls a u-turn into and through a line of oncoming, full-speed traffic. We kinda thought we were gonna die on that one.
• Write down where you want to go, show it to them, and ask them if they can take you there. I'm not positive, but it seems the drivers are honest enough to tell you if they don't know where it is or if they can't even get you close. If there's another driver near they may flag him down for you. Be aware that if they don't know exactly where it is they may just drop you near and you'll have to hoof it and possibly ask for directions along the way.
• MAKE HIM TURN ON THE METER. Once you've ascertained that he can get you where/near where you want to go, tell him to turn on the meter. If he hems and haws, say ""meter or nothing."" If he still refuses to turn on the meter, find a different driver. If you don't do this, and don't agree on a price beforehand he will rob you blind. If you agree on a price beforehand he may just up the price midway because he can. This happened to Jim, Fae and Sam, and Jim threw a fit but they still paid. In my personal opinion, if this happens to you, just pretend to grumble but have the bills for the original agreed fare in your hands. Then when he drops you off, hand over the bills and walk away. He tried to cheat you, might as well cheat a bit back. But really, best way is to just turn on the meter.
• Enjoy the experience. There's nothing like it.
• Sometimes you can get away with paying a few Rs less than the agreed price, but only if it's 2 Rs, none of you have 2 Rs and another customer comes along and the driver needs to go. Then he'll curl his hand into a fist, face down, then sweep his fingers down and towards you and say ""take it and go"" like he's disgusted with you. But you keep your rupees!


Our driver dropped us off on some corner and pointed in some direction and said something unintelligible. We wandered down the street in the direction he had pointed, asked for some directions and eventually found the others in our group who had been dropped off closer to the restaurant. Unfortunately, it had closed down between the publication of the book and tonight. So instead we dropped into a restaurant we had seen while walking down the street, one who's name I had recognized as also being in the Lonely Planet book--the Coconut Grove.

The place was cool, dark-wood and lamp ambiance with northern Indian-style food. When I ordered the ""chettinad button mushroom"" (chettinad is a region of india) the waiter graciously warned me that it was spicy. I then added a side of naan, and at the waiter's and Fae's suggestion (Fae is Iranian and so has experience eating similar cuisine) added in a side of curd (basically yogurt) to tame the capsaicin. Everyone got a ""plate,"" a 14"" metal circle with 2"" sides as the rim, with some sort of large leaf inside. Our dishes were then brought to the side of the plate, and you spooned stuff onto the plate and ate it from there.

The button mushroom was, indeed, spicy, but not unbearably so. It was a very thick gravy, laden with spices, with hunks of mushrooms floating around to make you feel all happy inside. The naan helped a little (mostly it was just tasty), Sam gave me some of her rice which helped too and made it even tastier, and the yogurt helped a lot. I'm very glad Fae and the waiter told me to get it or my stomach would have been extremely unhappy with me. The naan was a style I haven't seen yet--this time it was similar to a tortilla that has had lots of slits put it in it so it looks kind of like something a goth might wear, except it wasn't black. I finished off my meal with a ""mango waltz""--mango and vanilla ice cream with pieces of mango.

The ride back was relatively uneventful, but I really liked our driver this time. He made no fuss about turning on the meter, had mostly intelligible English, and asked us about what we were doing in Bangalore, how we liked it, etc. I even forgave him for trying to wheedle extra money out of us when we got to the hotel. I then finished unpacking, assembled Tweaker, hung out with Fae and Sam for awhile, then started blogging. It is now WAY past my bedtime, so I'm signing off!

July 22nd 2012
Published: July 22nd 2012


The weather when we arrived in Bangalore was beautiful, perfectly cool and perfectly humid. We had some drivers to chauffeur us from the airport to our hotel in Ganga Nagar. THANK GOODNESS. I'll explain why in a bit. The vehicle of choice was a van similar in style to a VW minibus, but with a bit more headroom and squishy seats that could seat 10 people comfortably. We six participants piled in the back to peer out the curtained windows, our guides hopped in the front and we were off on our road adventure.

And what an adventure it was. Anyone who has traveled to India knows: the traffic there operates on completely different rules than it does in the states. The white lines mean basically nothing. You drive in a mostly-straight line, use your horn often to let people know where you are, and stay on the left side of the road, but beyond that there are few rules to follow. Well, don't hit other cars/motorcycles, I guess. Oh, and the cows. Don't hit the cows. Because since they are sacred they wander the roads.

So for most of our 40-minute drive to Ganganagar I was staring as the variety of motorbikes, cars (some colorful and outlandish, some normal) that were often only literally inches from my nose. There were many buses, almost always full to the brim. One bus had a boy who was hanging out an open door as it drove along; when we stopped temporarily he hopped out and jogged around before jumping back onto the moving bus. Some men pee when they need to go and can find a wall. Almost no one wore shorts or anything above the knee. Most women wore saris or tunic and pants, but there were a few that wore jeans and t-shirts. Only once did I see a pair of shoulders, and those on a young boy working construction. Stray dogs roam the streets, and there are people everywhere. All the time. On the roads, by the roads, near the roads, walking, biking, chatting, laughing, sitting, anything, but there are people and there are a lot.

I like our hotel, though it is not very luxurious by American standards. I can hear the prayers over the speakers outside, which I like. I lucked out and got a room to myself on the second floor with some nice natural lighting and a comfy bed. To get the lights to work and the A/C to turn on, you have to stick your room key in a slot by the door. I didn't know this and when I first got here I went downstairs and told them my lights didn't work. They were so gracious, after asking me if I had put my key in the slot (duh) they actually sent someone up to show me how to do it. So now I know: some hotels have key-slots to activate the room's electricity. My largest snafu today came when my room phone rang (which is, incidentally, in the bathroom. Not sure why.) and I answered it to hear a man say, ""housekeeping."" ""Okay."" I said, then waited. Did they have a message for me? After a period of awkward silence it became apparent that they wanted something from me. Unfortunately I didn't know what they wanted. So we ended up having an awkward conversation where I almost hung up, or was silent, and so did he, and then I did hang up and went outside my room to talk to them since they were right there. I told them I didn't understand what they had wanted. In my defense, how could I? They hadn't actually asked me for anything. Well, we ended up not really communicating and he and his buddy smiled that awkward smile Indian people give you when you're not communicating well or you've done something wrong and they feel uncomfortable. Turns out I think they were seing if I had anything to launder, so next time I guess I should say ""I don't need anything, thanks.""

In the afternoon Reggie, Patrick and I walked around our street a bit to get a bite. We visited a KFC and a Domino's, and the boys chose Domino's (I wasn't eating). It was on the second story, which meant I was able to watch the busy street, and dogs and cows, while we waited. Afterwards I made them visit an alleyway I had scoped out as a possible unicycling location. That's going to be difficult, unicyclig here, because there aren't parking lots like I'm used to. I need large, relatively flat ground, where I won't get run over by speeding autorickshaws, and I might not get that here. Anyway, turns out the alleyway led to a pretty cool graveyard back behind the houses. Maybe I won't practice there.

Dinner is what has really made today fantastic. The dinner tonight was a reception with all of the Asia-Pacific School in Smart Structures students, which includes people from universities in Japan, China, Korea, U.S. and India. We started with a toast of Kingfisher beer, then everyone had to introduce themselves individually during this time. Of course, with 50 participants this took a large amount of time. This was happening on the top floor of our hotel, on a terrace which had some 6' walls that were stone on bottom half, glass up top, that looked over the city, and in particular down onto the roof terrace of the next building owner. I was leaned up against this wall, my back to the building, but at some point during the talktalk I turned around and was an Indian girl on the roof, watching this large group of foreigners right next door. She was wearing the tunic and leggings that you see in place of saris on some women, and a veil, all brightly colored, so I spotted her right off, grinned, and waved. She smiled and waved back and I turned back around to pay attention. Later on I peeked again to see if she was still there and saw that she had a friend with her now, and when they saw me look at them they collapsed into giggles and lash-fluttering. And that's when it hit me.

They were flirting with me. With my hair braided back, my male-styled tank and my guy's button-up t-shirt on top, they thought I was some blond foreigner flirting with them. I almost collapsed into giggles right then, it was so ridiculous. I did turn back to the room and tried not to attract their attention anymore but the damage was done. I have flirted with Indian girls. What's worse, I think they were only around 14 or so. I was definitely embarassed, when I realized what was going on, but the humor of the situation was not beyond me. When we broke from the terrace to sit down to eat I pulled Reggie and Patrick over to wave at them too, just for fun.

Dinner was one of the most amazing meals of my life. We sat and had plates in front of us, and waiters kepts coming around and offering bits of this, bits of that, whatever they had. Anytime they offered me something I just smiled and said ""yes, please"" regardless of what it was. I had potatoes, chicken, prawns, baby corn, tofu, fruit, veggies, and more, all cooked in an Indian kebab-style. I was getting a little full from the delicious food when I listened to someone talking next to me and realized that these were only the appetizers. There was a buffet next door with even more delicious food. I had veggie rice, egg-fried rice, dal (a tasty mush made of lentils), some lamb -in-mystery-sauce, some chicken-in-mystery-sauce. I piled the sauce-foods on the rice-foods on my plate and took it back to my seat. Then waiters brought around dosa and naan, two types of flatbreads. Dosa has a consistency that reminds me of steamed buns and naan is like pita, but not really.

I'm happy of how I ate tonight because I think I ate this food in a proper indian manner. The left hand stayed strictly in my lap and did not come anywhere near my food. I used my right hand to tear of bits of the naan or dosa, then laid those bits over the sauce-and-rice-and-meat and pinched the edges together to get a nice packet of flatbread-and-delicious. As I ate I conversed a lot with some Indian professors near me and I tried to learn more about Indian culture, what to expect, what to eat, how to eat, and much more.

The meal was concluded with the waiters handing around two bits of leaves wrapped up like a packet on a toothpick. I, unfortunately, thought it was more food and popped one into my mouth before finishing my ice cream. This matters because it was paan, an after-meal item meant to help digestion. The flavor is really strange. There's no way I can describe it, though I can describe the consistency. It's like chewing a leaf. Well, that's because it is a leaf. Kind of a thicker one, though, like a palm frond. What was really strange, besides the taste, was that I felt it doing something to my stomach. Kind of like when I eat mint and I can feel it in my stomach. The taste was so overpowering at first I found it a bit nauseating. The other kids that tried it definitely did not enjoy it either; it was hilarious to watch unwitting students pop one into their mouth and then make a really strange face. I tried to eat the first one fast so I could finish my ice cream, but didn't really enjoy it. I tried the second one, despite the first one being less-than-stellar, more out of trying to outdo the people around me than anything else. That's when I realized it's not meant to be chewed and eaten, paan is meant to be chewed and sucked on. It's not the leaves that are useful, it's the juices. And sure enough, the juices mae my stomach feel nice, though not if I had too much at once. Fun learning experience of the day.

After that we chatted with some of the students from other countries, and then I headed off to my room to write these first two entries. I figured I better stay up and do this now--if I keep having so many new experiences every day I can't afford to fall behind on writing them down!

July 22nd 2012
Published: July 22nd 2012


Whew! So much has happened already on this trip to Bangalore (or Bengaluru if you prefer) that I've decided to write a blog about it. This way my mom can keep careful track of me, my friends can see what hijinks I get up to, and maybe other people can benefit from the experiences I had traveling from North Carolina, USA to Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

My flight schedule was: 2-hour flight from NC to JFK (Friay afternoon), 7-hour flight to BRU (arrive Saturday morning), 8-hour flight to Delhi (arrive Saturday night), then (next Sunday morning) a 2-hour flight to Bangalore. Since I did not book my own tickets--they are courtesy of my Smart Structures program--I didn't even notice that I was overnighting in Delhi for about 7 hours. Luckily I was traveling with two other participants all the way from JFK so we exchanged emails about how we would deal with that layover. Not that the layover went as planned, but I'll get there. ;D

The flights were mostly uneventful, as was the airport in Brussels. I was interested in comparing my flight to Brussels, (operated by American) and my flight from Brussels (operated by Jet Airways). The second flight was definitely more comfortable, but it also just felt more luxurious. The AA flight had two movies, but the screens were in the center of the aisle so I, being tall and sitting in the window seat, could not see a lot of the screens. The food was okay, but mostly it just felt cramped and I'm glad I slept for some of that flight to get it over with.

In comparison, my second flight was GLORIOUS. There were screens in the backs of the seats with Hollywood movies, Bollywood movies, games, music, the whole shebang. The quality of the food on both flights was about the same, your usual airplane meal and snack, but I was delighted to be fed. I haven't been fed on a plane since I was five or so. I watched most of the Bollywood movie Robot, of which I had seen a few hilarious clips before this trip, and would have finished it except I accidentally exited the movie and reentering started you from the beginning with no good fast-forward option. So instead I watched ""Always Kabhi Kabhi"" (""Always Sometimes"") which is similar to High School Musical in style.

Things really took a turn for the adventurous in Delhi. There we were supposed to get off the plane, pass through immigration, get our bags, pass through customs, then check back in through a domestic transfer point to get back into the secured domestic area where we could get to our transit hotel, an hourly hotel within the airport. Unfortunately, we managed to get through immigration without a fuss, passing under some cool statues of huge hands in Buddhist or Hindu signs, but it was getting our bags that gave us trouble. Apparently the baggage handling system in Brussels broke down, and our plane was forced to leave with a large number of bags missing. This translated to my first true glance into Indian culture.

You see, it seems that one does not queue up in India. One MOBS. When people realized bags were missing, everyone flocked to the Baggage Enquiries desk, manned by a couple truly unlucky people that day. People were angry, voicing frustrated complaints in tones of voices that would probably have someone intervening in America with calming comments. The paperwork process to report our bags was roundabout and time-consuming: once you got a paper from the desk, you filled it out, gave it back to them while they filled out another form that they gave back to you to take down to a guy 50 feet to the left so he could stamp it and you could bring it back to the desk. This meant that this angry mob was stuck in front of that desk for hours. I hung out at the back. I wasn't going anywhere. Why get entangled? I was ridiculously amused, though, especially after they ran out of forms, went to get more, and were passing them out from the front of the mob. You've seen footage of the stock market, a huge group of agitated people waving papers in the air? Yeah, it was like that. I saw two guys wich a stack of papers almost go into a tug-of-war game and rip the whole stack. So, so amusing. And so different from anything I'd see back home.

After about two hours of hanging near the back of the mob and chatting with friendly Indian people who told me foods to eat, where to visit, Patrick and I (Yao did not check any bags so he had already gone to the hotel) decided we wouldn't bother to go to the hotel, we'd just crash the terminal. So we ""went through"" customs--it was deserted and we had no bags to be checked anyway--and into a really nice terminal. I partook in a sponge-bath in one of the bathrooms because I felt pretty gross and needed to wake up. There were ladies cleaning in the bathroom, and when I asked them if I could dunk my head they smiled and nodded. But when I tried to wipe down the sink after I was done they shooed me out and looked a bit put out. One of the Indian professors I spoke with tonight said that Indian people take hospitality very seriously, and I think that me trying to clean up after myself might have been insulting their hospitality. Or taking their job. Either way, I think they weren't super sad to see me go.

In the terminal I bought a tikka sandwich (it's like chicken salad with curry and onions) that was packaged exactly the same as they sell tuna sandwiches from gas stations in the states, and some water. Things are cheap here: the sandwich and water cost less than 200 Rs (rupees) which is around $3, and I probably got really overcharged for both. A bit later Patrick and I relocated to our gate, and I bought 2 samosas and a bottle of mango juice for around the same price. The mango juice was super-sweet, just as I expected. It tasted like someone pureed some mangos, then extricated all the water they possibly could. I think there were over 100g of sugar in that drink, but it was de-ri-cious. The samosas were also tasty, and the guy at the coffee shop even heated them up in the microave, or as they say ""made it hot."" I tried to practice eating properly, with only my right hand, but I think my technique is still a bit foreign because I was biting chunks out of the samosas and I saw a guy tearing hunks off and dipping them in the provided ketchup. I'll have to try that next time.

After that, it was simply a matter of waiting before we boarded our last flight to Bangalore. Three other APSS participants were due to fly with us on that flight, and they only barely made the connection due to baggage/customs/etc. I don't remember much of the flight--I hadn't slept much, or well, in the last 36 hours so I sank into REM awhile into the flight and only woke up when we touched down. And then I was in Bangalore.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Mysore
July 14th 2012
Published: August 1st 2012


Mysore has always been one of the major tourist attractions in South India. My previous visit to Mysore was about 20 years ago, when I was in college. I still keep a lot of great memories of that college trip to Mysore and we remember some of the words from the tourist guide in the palace.

After we moved from USA to Bangalore, we wanted to visit all of the major tourist attractions around Bangalore and Mysore was an obvious choice. Many people from Bangalore visit Mysore and return on the same day. However, considering there are several places to see in Mysore, it may not be a fun trip if you rush from place to place with a tight schedule in hand. Two days is ideal to see most attractions in Mysore.

We wanted to make it a real fun trip and so we decided to spend 2 nights and 2 full days in Mysore.
Brindavan Garden, Mysore


We started after lunch from Bangalore. The drive was very comfortable in the highway. We were estimating to reach Brindavan Garden by around 4:30 but got lost the way in Mysore town and so it was about 6'O clock when we entered the garden. It was very crowded and we could not enjoy the garden since it was already dark. We took a small boat trip within the garden, watched the musical fountain and exited the place at about 7:30pm.
Our stay in Hotels



We did not have a hotel reservation in Mysore. That is becoming a practice for us these days. Most of the weekend trip we made were without a hotel reservation. Sometimes we landed in to trouble but most of the times we were able to find good hotels at relatively low rates when we walk in and ask for room rates. We returned to Mysore town from Brindavan and I started driving around looking for hotel. I stopped in front of a 3-Star hotel but they did not have any room available. Once I got in to the car after enquiring availability in the hotel, someone came in a scooter and knocked on the car. I drove away quickly since I didn't know his intentions. But he kept following us and started shouting and waving his hands. Finally I stopped the car in a crowded area and asked what he wants. Then he explained that he can help us get a hotel room at low rates in the available vacant rooms. After negotiating the rates, he took us to a hotel called ""Adhi Manor"" where he arranged an A/c room for us at a rent about 40%!o(MISSING)f their published rates.

Hotel Adhi Manor: The hotel was pathetic. Very poor quality rooms, lot of bugs around and not even the reception looked good. The bed was very old. Based on our request, they moved us to another room but that was no different. Next morning, the first thing I did was to find another hotel for the rest of our stay in Mysore.

Hotel Palace Plaza: After visiting couple of hotels, I found Hotel Palace Plaza, which turned out to be an excellent place for stay in Mysore. Rent was bit high compared to the low rates we got in the previous hotel but the stay was very comfortable. Due to the bad experience previous night, we did not had much expectations, but we all loved the new place. They have a restaurant called ""Dynasty"", which served very tasty food for us, looked very clean and have very friendly staff. I have written a bit more on the best restaurants in Mysore.
Mysore Zoo - the best attraction in Mysore



After a tasty breakfast at Dynasty, we visited Mysore Zoo. We spent about 3 hours in the zoo but the kids were very tired after walking all the way within the zoo. We somehow wanted to get out of the place, but even though tired, kids wanted to see all animals. The zoo was pretty crowded but since it is a huge area, the crowd did not make it uncomfortable. After seeing hundreds of animals, we exited the zoo and drove back to the hotel for a short break.

Keeping the taste of breakfast in mind, we returned the Dynasty restaurant in Hotel Mysore Palace for lunch and ordered some Chinese food. They served the hot food in the room. Not sure if it was because we were all hungry and tired, but we felt it was one of the best food we had recently!

Horse Safari

After lunch, we took a small nap and then came out of the room. We saw many horse safaris near the temple. We negotiated with couple of people and finally came down the rate from Rs 500 to Rs 250 for a 20 minute ride. (Later, we met other people who offer the same ride for Rs 75). During the 20 minute ride, they offered us to take to a great market place in Mysore were we can shop as long as we want and he will wait outside for us. And he said this was a courtesy to the visitors to Mysore, but it was cheating. He took us to a textile showroom were we ended up spending lot of money (our fault) and later realized the horse safari people took us there to get commission for the items we purchased.

After the safari and shopping, we returned to the hotel, took a shower, changed the dress and then started looking around for places for dinner. Even though we loved the food at the restaurant in the hotel, we decided to try something else for dinner. We had heard about the theme restaurant at Hotel Pai Vista, which was walking distance from our hotel. The restaurant looked very interesting. It was made with the theme of a jungle/forest. The waiters were dressed like hunters and they had lot artificial animals or stuffed animals everywhere in the restaurant. Food was bit expensive but was tasty. Kids enjoyed watching the animals and messing with the hunters!
Mysore Palace - the historical monument in Mysore



Mysore Palace is the giant palace of the Kings, which attractions millions of domestic and foreign visitors every year. Photography is not allowed inside the palace but you can take pictures outside the buildings. It will take about 1 to 2 hours to see and enjoy the palace. You can rent automated voice guide system which will give detailed history of each important buildings and rooms in the palace.
Shopping in Mysore



Mysore is a great place for shopping silk items and Sandal products. However, be aware of lot of fraud referrals. Taxi driver, auto rickshaw driver, travel guides - almost anyone you meet would refer you to some of the ""best market"" that is offering some ""special deals"" ""only on that day""! We fell into that trap multiple times and ended up wasting lot of money in various shops. For example, a tourist guide who offered to take us to many attractions like Sandalwood factory at a very nominal fee of Rs 40. We drove all the way with him just to see a small shop, which claimed is the factory. We were expecting a huge factory where they cut big trees and make various things from Sandalwood, but disappointed to see a small shop which wasn't worth the drive at all. Moreover, the guide had said the factory is open only on Tuesdays for visitors but we learnt from the shop that it is open for all any day.

Getting here, going there, etc


desk/work area
I've made it here... in one piece. Thank the deity (also known more commonly as Ina).



I had a couple of ideas last night for names of my first entry. They all came to me on my cab ride from the airport to my apartment. The country (this area at least) feels similar to the Western Caribbean, with blocky, cement dominated architecture, similar food and sporadic packs of wild dogs (they're not dangerous... from what I hear). There are many things here that are direct imports from the West: one block we drove down had a series of signs for a McDonald's placed every few steps... McDonald's, 149 steps ahead! McDonald's, 113 steps ahead! McDonald's 86 steps ahead! McDonald's, on your right! But my favorite: a sign for Hot in Cleveland, Betty White's new show (the inspiration for this post's title), which I've actually rarely seen advertised in the U.S. I guess in today's world, no matter how far you travel on this rock, you're never that far from home.

Getting here took quite a toll: Qatar Airways figured out my plot to have my own row and bumped me to what they promised was a much
kitchen/dining nook
Don't worry, I won't be eating the fruit
better location on the plane. They sat me next to a father and daughter who were nice enough, but we were in an emergency exit row so even though I had extra leg room, there was nowhere in front of me to stow my backpack that I filled with goodies for the trip, so I had to put it overhead. I tried sleeping the full twelve hours to Doha, Qatar (my layover), but was interrupted by people kicking me on their way to and from the bathrooms and soda carts knocking into my left elbow. Since our plane landed 20 minutes late, I made it to my connecting flight with only 15 minutes to spare. Luckily, security in Doha was efficient (you get to keep your shoes on your feet!). I left on a Sunday night, got here on a Tuesday morning at 3 am, and slept until 6 pm, which means I haven't seen the sun in a very long time (don't ask me to do that math).

My apartment (pics posted) is as nice as expected; I've got a kitchenette, a large living room, a dining nook, desk for work, large bedroom with king-sized bed, and a
living room
spa inspired bathroom all to myself!

Traveling within Bangalore in interesting, to say the least. Unfortunately, leaving the hotel by foot is not recommended, and there isn't much around the hotel other than furniture stores and crumbling bodegas (I'm sure they have a name for them here, but I've yet to learn it), so I will be spending quite a bit of time in my apartment. For trips other than to and from work I will have to find myself a driver since renting a car is impractical and driving in the city is pretty dangerous: red lights mean nothing, lines in the road are mere suggestions, sidewalks don't exist, and the car horn is a well developed but little understood language by foreigners. Thank god wages here are low and the exchange rate is favorable; a personal driver it is!

Work starts tomorrow at 1pm local time. At this point, I am content with my accommodations and am optimistic about this trip. I will have a better feel for how things will go the next six months in the coming days as I assess what work will entail and get a sense of what Bangalore has to
my shower
offer. More to come!

Until next time,

xoxo,

View of the beautiful hills from Divine Euphoria
I just came back from a trip to Divine Euphoria, one of the most attractive weekend destination near Bangalore. Whenever we travel to any vacation places or picnic spots around Bangalore, I take down a lot of notes hoping to blog about it, but I hardly get time time once I get back home. Even though we have visited most of the popular weekend destinations around Bangalore and have taken hundreds of photos, I have published only a few so far. I am hoping to write about them all in the coming few months, once our kids start going to school after the vacation.

Divine Euphoria is our favorite weekend destination and picnic location around Bangalore. Yesterday was our third visit to this amazing farmland picnic place, after I purchased a small plot there to build our own farmhouse. Before I go too far, let me give some background about this place and how we found this place.

After spending a good part of our life abroad, we decided to come back to our home country and spend the rest of our life here enjoying what we really love. Buying some farmland having lot of animals and lot of
Birds in the farmland
fun was one of the entertainment plans. I started searching for some kind of ""managed farmland"" where someone else will take care of all the work and we just need to spend our time with plants and pets. I posted the requirement in some forums and someone pointed us to Divine Euphoria. When we read more about them, it was like our dream coming destination.
Divine Euphoria FarmLand project near Bangalore


You can look at their website and get more information. Here is a high level overview of this farm land project:


• Divine Euphoria is a Farm Land style vacation destination near Bangalore, India
• It is located on the Sangam Road, after Kanakapura, about 65 km from Bangalore
• You can buy small plots there and build your own farmhouse
• You cannot build any concrete/cement buildings. You cannot build a house to live for practical reasons (unless you love to live in a typical Indian village with no access to schools, hospitals, colleges, offices etc)
• Legally, you can build only farm house to take care of the farm, but practically, it can be a vacation home in the style of a farm house. There are many styles of
The boat house being built in Divine Euphoria
farm houses already built by many people which include wooden cottage, mud house, tent house etc.
• Divine Euphoria is a resort-cum-farm land. There are lot of common facilities like library, swimming pool, club house, indoor games, outdoor games, pets, animals, walking trails and so on.
• They have preserved a farmland atmosphere, even though it has all facilities of a resort. You will see an ideal farmland there with lot of animals, fishing ponds, lakes, birds etc. The place is sourrounded by Hills on all sides. You can see a distant view of a Dam built for irrigation purposes. They have a restaurant and most modern amenities you see in luxury villages.

Our recent visit to the farmland near Bangalore


We started from our home in Sarjapur Road, in Bangalore at about 8:45 in the morning. Since it was a short day trip, we decided to go by a taxi instead of driving myself. It took about 1 hour 30 minutes to reach the farmland. The drive through the villages and hilli areas was fabulous. One thing to note is, once you leave Kanakapura town, you will not see any shops, not even a country tea shop. So, if
Hanuman statue at the famland
Divine Euphoria is a farm land project near Bangalore
you are planning to visit the Divine Euphoria farmland, but some snacks, drinks and anything else you need from Bangalore itself or from Kanakapura. We spend about 6 hours in the farmland watching the birds and animals. Spend some time in the Yoga center which was on top of some high elevations and in the bottom of a big hill. You cannot find any better place to do some yoga and meditation. The swimming pool, boat house, library and boat house are not operational yet but we spend some time looking at the constructions and also listening to their marketing talk about the ambitious future plans! I think if they implement atleast 50% of their plans, Divine Euphoria will become the best picnic destination around Bangalore.

We met one lady from Punjab or Mumbai who was living there in a tent cottage. She seem to be a frequent visitor with her children and grand children. This time she was with her son and was planting lot of fruit trees in her farm plot. She owns a pretty big plot there and has planted a lot of trees and vegetables. I wonder if she would be able to pick the

Here is a ready to use tent house in Divine Euphoria. This tent house was already occupied by a lady visitor from Mumbai. She purchased a farmhouse plot at Divine Euphoria after reading the reviews about the project. She is from Mumbai and comes all the way to this place for vacations. When I met her, she said it was her 5th visit to the place.
fruits/vegetables unless she visit often. When I asked her about it, she simply smiled and said her intention is not to make money out of vegetables. That was very true. I don't think even we bought the plot there to plant vegetables and harvest. Instead, people are there to have some quite and relaxing time with the nature and nurture the trees and plants.
Divine Euphoria Reviews


Like to have some time with the mother nature, away from the crowd and pollution of cities like Bangalore? You will not see any better place than Divine Euphoria. Even though there are many other farmlands near Bangalore, I don't see anything else even comparable to Divine. Whether you want to buy your own plot and build a farm house or buy an already built cottage or just rent a cottage for overnight stay or just have some day trip picnic, you can confidentally choose this place.

All good things come with some not so good experience as well. Here are some drawbacks I can think of about this place:


• No internet connection. If you are a busy worker and like to continue your online work while your family
Wooden cottage at Divine Euphoria
This is another cottage which look very beautiful. This is ready to occupy and serves the weekend visitors from Bangalore to this farmland often.
enjoy the vacation, you do not have any choices here (unless you have your own mobile internet or data card)
• No hospitals in the vicinity if you have an emegency. No doctor on call. Medical help may be too far.
• No restaurants nearby. You will have to either cook yourself or depend on their restaurant, which is not yet completed.
• Slow progress of the project. They launched the project more than a year ago, but it is not even near completion. Day picnics and night stays are offered only for the potential customers and people who have contacts with them. Not yet open for public. Very less visitors currently.
• Private properties are mixed with common amenities. You will have no idea which cottage is occupied by private parties and which are common properties which everybody can walk in to.
• Too large area sorrounded by hills. Small kids may get lost within the property because of similar looking plots and roads.
• No internal transportation. You may have to drive or walk pretty long distance from one amenity to other. They said they will provide battery operated carts like Golf cart, but I don't see anything coming up yet.


I
Mud house at Divine Euphoria
This mud house is under construction. I think this is a model cottage, which visitors can rent for overnight stay at the farmland. I think visitors from Bangalore and other metro cities who live in concrete apartments would love to spend a few nights in a mud house.
have given my feedbacks to the developers few times and they seem to be listening to all suggestions. None of my suggestions are implemented so far, but they promised they will look in to all these. I have written more detailed review of Divine Euphoria Farmland project at IndiaTravelBlog.
How to reach Divine Euphoria


The farmland is located about 65 km from Bangalore city. If you are coming from Sarjapur Road or Martaalli area, take the Hosur Rd and then take NICE road. Exit at Kanakapura Road. You will reach Kanakapura within an hour. After Kanakapura junction, take the left turn towards Sangam road, which leads to the Cauvery river and the famouse fishing camps. After about 11 km, you will see a small sign board on the leftside to Divine Euphoria. The destination is about 1 km from the statehighway to Sangam.

Avoid travelling in the night to the place since it will be hard to get guidance in case you get lost. There are not many houses around and you will hardly see any people after sunset.

Of all the wonderful places and palaces I have seen in India there is one thing that has truly impacted my enjoyment of exploring here, and that is that in this country, to all men I must be invisible. At first I thought our guide's only looking at and speaking to my young roommate was an older man thing, where he was infatuated with a young woman and flattered by her attention. This was bothersome, and I mentioned it to him, but he denied it vigorously, and tried, after that, to look at me occasionally to make his point, and when he did, I felt acknowledged, a powerful thing. He is a lovely man, extremely generous and very kind, but although he is a professional guide and is 69 years old, he has a blind spot as to his looking at and speaking only to my roommate, Meghan, and not to me. He definitely should know better. For the past two weeks I have been an afterthought, an ""Oh, yes, you are there too"" sort of startling remembrance, but it happens too infrequently. ""Meghan, is that alright with you?"" ""Meghan, do you want tea?"" ""Meghan, we'll meet at 5PM."" ""Meghan, tomorrow morning yoga at 7:30AM. Okay?"" ""Meghan, do you need a break?"" ""Meghan, how long is your flight home?"" Never have I been included in any of these comments or questions, and after two weeks of being basically ignored in our very small group, it hurts.

Yesterday we went to the Keoladeo Ghana Bird Sanctuary, one of the national parks in India. It is absolutely stunning. We saw not only many species of birds, but jackals, antelope, a python sleeping in a tree; it is a peaceful and beautiful place. Part of our experience there was riding bicycles through the sanctuary, as it is so large bicycling makes it much easier to go further into the park. Somehow I got a semi-broken bike; it made alarming and loud noises with each revolution, and felt like something was dragging, slowing the bike down. I have both an off-road bike and a racing bike at home, so I know what a bicycle should sound and feel like, and this one was not in good repair. But the sanctuary guide and my roommate set off ahead, so I had to use this one or lose them. I could see the guide talking and pointing out many things to my roommate, and when I caught up I had to ask him what he had said, what I had missed seeing. This was irritating, as here was yet another guide who was pretending he had only one person on his tour, the young one. I was again the leftover.

Usually my ego is strong enough to weather passing insults, but with the stress of trying to keep up on a basically broken bike, and again seeing that I was nothing in this guide's eyes, I almost lost it. I kept telling myself, you are bicycling through a bird sanctuary in India! Think how remarkable that is! And asking for divine help in being gracious and not yelling at them or telling them how rude and insensitive they were being. ""The mind creates the abyss, the heart crosses it."" So said Sri Nisargadatta, and I tried mightily to destroy the abyss. On the long ride back (about 12 kilometers total) they rode very far ahead; at times I wasn't sure which road they had taken. Once they waited for me to catch up, but went on talking just to each other, and then they both pulled very far ahead of me again. I didn't see them until we were back at the beginning of the park; they were still chatting and waiting for our driver to take us back to our hotel when I finally arrived. I was so very hurt at their insensitivity, magnified, I'm sure, by the stress of trying to ride a malfunctioning bike so many miles. I did tell them it would have been nice to have had company, but both seemed surprised. ""Who is she? What's she doing here? Is she a part of our group?""

No one, I think, wants to get older, to see physical changes that inevitably come with aging, but considering the alternative, most of us continue to press on, to do the best we can with what we've got. But why don't people understand that ALL human beings continue to have feelings and need respect their whole lives long? Is there a switch we should find when we turn 50 to turn off our feelings, or simply accept less than what is given to others who are younger? Are we no longer human beings, worthy of love, compassion, consideration, or attention? I remember learning at a very young age that older people have feelings. This sounds strange, but I must have been 5 years old at the time, and I was still small enough that my father would sometimes pick me up when he came home from work. He was carrying me around the kitchen (which was very exciting, as I could see what was on top of the hutch, the refrigerator, mysterious and appealing places when you are very small and curious), and then for some reason I looked at his arm holding me. He had blond hairs growing on his arm, and I pulled one, trying to get it to come out. He uttered a cry of discomfort and quickly set me down. I was sad because I was no longer being carried, and absolutely surprised that anything could hurt my Daddy. But I also learned that day that even older people have feelings. He told me, ""That hurts! Don't ever hurt people."" I guess (at the tender age of 5 years old) I had never thought about grown-ups or older people having feelings, but from that day on my eyes were opened to the fact that other people felt things too, and not just my own little self. It was a good lesson in learning to become unselfish, to becoming thoughtful and considerate of others.

When we reach our 40s, 50s, 60s, and some readers I know are already in their 70s, we still need respect, consideration, kindness, and love. We are still the same human beings we've been all our lives, it's just that when we look in the mirror now we wonder who that person is. I don't feel inside what I see in the mirror; put up a reflection of me at 20 and that's what I feel like, that's how I still see myself in my mind's eye (and in my dreams). It's always a surprise to see photographs of myself, since that's not who I think I am.

This story is not about jealousy, but my reaction to unkindness, thoughtlessness, basically rude behavior and hurtful actions, all --not directed, since I seem to be invisible here-- just lumped right there where I am, except they don't see me. And that hurts. What have I become, as an older woman, a ghost? Am I no longer worthy of attention or conversation?

We all crave, or at least need, attention; otherwise we are nobody to others. And that's what has caused my unhappiness these past two weeks in India: I have been treated like nobody, even though I am sitting or standing right there beside whoever is talking; to them it must be that I am simply not there. (The exception to this is when we visit places where children and vendors try to sell things. Then I am certainly noticed!) I know our guide does think of me, as he includes me in his gift buying, his presentation materials, his ordering foods I especially enjoy, but when he speaks to us, he only looks at and speaks to or asks questions of Meghan. Am I being oversensitive? As a female I do not know if older men are treated this way in India, but I wonder if they experience the same feelings of marginalization. (I think not.)

Several years ago I saw the movie ""Michael""; all I remember about the story is that he was an angel. One of the characters in the movie asked him how he knew so much about people, and his surprising, stunningly simple answer was, ""I pay attention."" So should we all. In the meantime, I will continue to look at our guide when he speaks only to Meghan, and hope that he remembers there are two of us present. It wouldn't matter so much if there were more people in the group, as then I'd have someone else to talk with, to be with, but with only two of us it is a difficult situation for the one left out. Such a simple oversight has blighted the whole experience of this otherwise amazingly wonderful tour.

What is Buddha Poornima


The Vaisakha Poornima (full moon day of the first Lunar month) is known as Buddha Poornima Goutama Buddha the founder of Buddhism had taken birth on this day. It is believed that Buddha also got enlightened on the same Vaishakha poornima and also passed away on the same day of Vaisakha Poornima.

Where is Pyramid Valley


From Bangalore City, drive towards Kanakpura on National Highway 209. After a few kms you will cross NICE ring road. Then after about 18 kms you will find a sign board to take a left turn for Buddha Pyramid.

I had given more details on the route and other info on pyramid valley in my previous article. Please refer the details of pyramid valley in the following links. http://freejournal.heliohost.org/freejournal/?/articles/2012/03/25/maitreya-buddha-pyramid-bangalore.html



Registration for Participation


Buddha Poornima is celebrated every year in Pyramid valley. Brahmarshi Patriji conducts his music meditation through his mesmerizing flute performance. This year (2012) the Buddha poornima was celebrated during 4th-6th May 2012.

The participation to the celebration was based on Registration. The registration charges were Rs 450/- per person for all three days, which included daily 3 times food and shared accommodation inside the pyramid valley.

1st day of Buddha Poornima Celebration


We reached there in 4th May morning, the first day of celebration. We got of participants’ badges from the reception. We saw a queue for the breakfast and got into the queue. That time there were about a thousand people, but many more were just flowing in.

Our accommodation was inside the Pyramid. Generally the pyramid is meant for meditation only. But only during Buddha poornima celebration, a large number of participants are accommodated inside the pyramid, because of shortage of general accommodation.

Maitreya-Buddha Pyramid is world’s largest meditational pyramid. The size of the pyramid is 160ft. x 160ft. Height 102 ft (equivalent to 10 floor building). To know more about Buddha Pyramid, please read my previous article in journalsite:

http://journalsite.tk/journalsite/articles/viewarticle.asp?articleid=213

During daytime there were some spiritual classes. Some experienced people shared their experiences on spiritual journey. Below is a picture of the classroom.



During lunch time I noticed a crowd was moving near lunch area. When I went near the crowd I saw the crowd was around Brahmarshi Patriji. People were shaking their hands with Patriji and conveying their wishes. I also had the privilege of shaking hands with Patriji (picture below).



The evening started with an inaugural function. That was the first of the three-day celebration. The celebration was conducted at the amphitheatre inside the pyramid valley. There was a huge gathering of about five thousand people.



There were three eminent guests who delivered their valuable speeches. Patriji was a perfect anchor on the stage, coordinating the guests and participants, sometimes interpreting English speeches into Telugu and sometimes stimulating the crowd with humorous comments. After the spiritual lectures, music and cultural programs continued on the stage while people slowly moved for dinner at their convenience.

2nd day of Buddha Poornima Celebration


The second day morning started with a music meditation at 5 AM. We were woken up at 4.30 to attend the meditation. Brahmarshi Partriji was playing flute with three others artists on other instruments. All the participants were sitting on meditation (picture below), some on chairs and some on the lawn.



Meditating on the flute music was a beautiful experience. Besides Patriji’s performance on flute was also extraordinary. As getting up at 4.30 AM was difficult for many, some participants were taking their nice sleep in the name of meditation. After music meditation Patriji spoke on Buddha poornima and spirituality. Overall it was a fantastic experience.

We had to make queues for breakfast and bathrooms. Some preferred to go to toilet first and some preferred to have breakfast first. When I saw a big crowd near toilets I decided to have breakfast first fearing that the food might finish if I make late.



After breakfast I thought to explore the valley. When I walked behind about half km, I discovered a beautiful Shani temple. There was a remarkably big anthill near the Shani temple (picture above). After visiting Shani temple I came back to the program.



During daytime there were spiritual classes (picture above). Besides, there was also a dance performance by Pyramid Spiritual Science Academy, Bangalore. In the afternoon some of us we went to Tapasthali, about half km on hillside inside the pyramid valley.



There is a beautiful statue of lord Shiva in Tapasthali. Many people were doing meditation near the shiva statue. From Tapasthali we could see the Pyramid nicely. The views of the hills and the valley were beautiful. I could also see the shani temple from distance which I visited in the morning.

The evening program started at 5 PM in amphitheatre. There were two guests who delivered their speech. Patriji also mesmerized the audience with his beautiful songs and speeches. There was lot of music and cultural program afterwards while the dinner was going on simultaneously.

3rd day of Buddha Poornima Celebration


The 3rd day morning again we were woken up at 4.30 to attend the music meditation at 5 AM. Patriji was on flute with three other artists, who were on tabla, violin and mandolin (picture below). All the people were enjoying the flute and doing meditation at the same time



The third day was the last day of the celebration as well as the full moon day or birthday of Lord Buddha. After the music meditation, Patriji spoke on Buddha, Meditation, Pyramid Meditation, Pyramid Masters and on other spiritual concepts. He spoke about the concept of “Maitri”, “Karuna”, “Mudita” and “Upeksha” the four methods of dealing with others.

After the morning program, we had to stand on long queues for food. The food area was near the amphitheatre (the program area) which was about half a km away from the toilet area. Although it was very irritating to walk half a km for going to toilet, soon I realized the benefits, as it was a good compulsory exercise to digest the food and stay active.



The lunch queue was longer than the previous days (probably there were more participants on the last day). There were about six food counters (three starting counters and three repeat counters), but there were endless queues near each food counter. Some wise foodies like me were taking the food plate and standing immediately in the queue near repeat counter, finishing the food plate while standing in the queue.



Before evening program, we saw Patriji walking near the Pyramid surrounded by a large number of followers (picture above). People were shaking hands with him. Some people were having quick interactions. Patriji was also wishing people in different styles.

The evening program started as usual at 5 PM. Patriji gave his valuable speech to the audience. Patriji is not only a spiritual leader he is many in one. He was coordinating all the programs on the stage as the main anchor; he was interpreting speeches in between Hindi, English and Telugu, honoring the guests with shawls and gifts and doing many other activities on the stage. His songs (prayers) and speeches were very inspiring.



The evening program continued with cultural programs, songs, music and dances by various artists. There was also a group meditation till late night. It was the night of the celebration, the full moon day, the auspicious birthday of Lord Buddha.

At the end


My experience went fine with all the events of the three-day celebration. The participants were mostly from Andhra Pradesh, followed by Bangalore, followed by other places. I was quite impressed to see such a big crowd coming from different parts of the country. In my guess there were more than five thousand participants.

Personally I liked Patriji’s flute performance and spiritual speeches. He says he is against all doctors and healers of any kind. He advises to live without fear of death and be ready to accept death happily at anytime. Some of his speeches are to be understood not just by words but in right context with appropriate spiritual maturity .

How to reach Sangam


Sangama is about 95 kms from bangalore, the place of confluence of two rivers – Arkavathi and Kaveri (Cauvery). Mekedatu is about 5 kms on the other side of the river. We had visited the place last year and liked much. Incidentally we visited the place again this year. However, the visit was still interesting.

From Bangalore you have to go to Kanakapura and then take the road going to Sangama/ Mekedatu. I had gone there last year and given the route details in my previous article. Please refer http://freejournal.heliohost.org/freejournal/?/articles/2012/03/27/sangam-and-mekedatu.html
Visiting Sangam again after a Year


Last year when we visited Sangam, we visited Chunchi falls and could not get time for visiting Muthathi. This year we had no plans for Sangam again, but the plan was for Muttathi and Bheemeswhari. But on the day of visit, we thought why not to cover Sangam again. Driving 45 kms on highway is simpler than driving anywhere within Bangalore city. The decision was not bad. The road was very good. We soon reached there in Sangam.



The road to Sangam is always fascinating with large number of mayflower trees on both sides of the way – as if ready to greet all the visitors.

Interestingly it was the same summer season as our last visit. Hence, the scenery was not much different. As before, there was not much of water in the river. As it was not a holiday, there were less number of people. We soon got into the water for bathing.



After getting into the water, we marked that the water was dirty and there were various types of insects in the water. I was scared for a moment and was about to get out of water. But next moment I saw others bathing very happily and became fearless. Enjoyed water for a long time.


Comparing with last Year


Last year we had gone Sangam in April, the water was about 2 to 3 feet in average. This time it was May, hence the water was even less at many places. Crossing the river was much simpler.

Bathing although was difficult with less water you could always walk to a place where there was slightly more water.

Last time it was a Sunday, so there were about 500 visitors. This time it was a regular day, the number of visitors were about 100.

Because of less people, the bus to Mekedatu was waiting indefinitely to be filled up with passengers.

Some more constructions near the entrance, other things were almost the same.


The Sangameshwar Temple


After having bath in Sangam, we visited Sangameshwar Temple, which is just near that place. It is a small temple, but neat and clean. There are lot of monkeys around, they took our bag, opened up everything to see if there was any thing of their interest. Luckily left the bag there at a distance.


The word of caution


The river baths, whether in Sangama or in Muthathi or other places, are considered to be risky. Many people loose their lives every year in Sangam and similar places. Besides there are Crocodiles in some seasons. One has to be careful about those too.
Other places nearby


While going to Sangam and Mekedatu, you can combine visiting other places such as Chunchi falls, TK falls, Pyramid Valley, Muthathi, Bheemeshwari etc. However, from my experience, combining too many things does not give you adequate time to see the places. I would suggest not combining more than two places to visit in a day.

You must read my previous article on Sangam in order to make this experience complete http://freejournal.heliohost.org/freejournal/?/articles/2012/03/27/sangam-and-mekedatu.html as I have deliberately not mentioned many things in order to avoid repetition.

Chilligeri Estate
So far I was pretty happy that my tour was going as per my plan. However I was rather confused to opt from the 4 spots which were not in my schedule. Irpu Falls, Kabini WLS, Nagarhole NP and Shivanasamudram waterfalls. I had previous appointments to attend in Kochi so I would be heading for Kerala, this was the thought. I finally voted for Irpu Falls as the place was not known to the tourists. After saying ‘virtual’ good bye to rest of the three places I went to bed as I had to wake up early next day.



I woke up at 6am and hit the road in next 15 minutes. I had to take care of my personal hygiene. I walked in to the bus stand in Mysore and from my research I knew that I had to take a bus to Gonnikopal. There are several routes to reach Irpu. One can follow the Hunsuru-Gonikoppal route to Kutta, Mysore-Nagarhole route to Kutta and finally Mysore-Kabini route to Kutta. But as red from the magazines, I decided to follow the Gonnikopal route because of maximum availability of public transports. I took a bus which was on the
Road through Chilligeri Estate
way to Virajpet and as said earlier and again, buses in Karnataka are the best when it comes to schedule and accessibility. Within 5 minutes I was cursing down the Mysore-Madikeri road where I had my footsteps left on my previous tour to Bylakuppe (separate blog). This road wasn’t new to me but still it was pretty enjoyable early in the morning. The bus took more than an hour and half to reach Hunsuru and driving further 10km, took a diversion to the left and hit the Mysore-Virajpet road. First a few miles it was through the villages of Karnataka and later it hit the forest area. This was early in May and chance of a shower was bleak, so the lush green outfields were ‘green’ but not shining. Once the bus entered the forest area I picked myself up from the seat hoping if something could get caught in my eyes. As expected, in next 15 minutes I noticed a wild elephant on the right and the locals not seemed to show any interest as they were quite ‘used to’ with this kind of wild animals. The bus quit the forest roads and started climbing up the hills. The
Flowers at Chilligeri Estate
road here was through the coffee and pepper estates. Most of the passengers were either working in one of those estates. I was really enjoying the scenic ‘pleasures’ and was thinking about my next journey from Gonnikopal to Kutta which was around 36 kms. Around 10:30 am I reached Gonnikopal. It seemed to me a small town with very basic facilities available. Then I didn’t know the challenges were in ahead of me.



I knew that I was in Coorg, so the first thing I decided to have was a ‘cup of coffee’. I walked in to a small restaurant, opposite to the bus stand and helped myself with a cup of coffee. It was as fresh as the beans were handpicked from the nearby estates. This part of Karnataka is enriched with coffee and pepper plantation and most of the homestays or resorts are either ‘an old estate’ or a part of it converted to a homely accommodation for tourists. I spent some time noticing the local crowd and their styles. The first thing I noticed was the typical style of wearing a ‘saree’ which eventually looked like a ‘nighty’ at the first shot. When asked
Flowers at Chilligeri Estate
the hotel guy, he said that this was called ‘Kodava Sarees’, with no difference than the regular sarees we see but the style of draping made the difference. After spending a few ‘gazing moments’ at the ‘Coorgi beauties’ (as people may not know, the girls from Coorg are known for their unfathomed charm) I walked back in to the bus stand.



Oh my god ! I may have sounded like ‘Janice from famous Tv series Friends’. Where the hell the busses were going to ? I asked a fellow about the buses towards Kutta and he ‘scanned’ me from my head to toe and said.



‘Kutta????? No sir, it’s Kutta’



I understood the difference, It should be Kutta not Kutta (means dog in hindi), though the spelling is the same. ‘Narrow escape’ was the first call to me however I moved towards ‘a point’ where the bus to Kutta was waiting for me. All I could see people from different ages,sizes,heights were present in that bus. Forget about getting my butt to rest, I didn’t find a place to climb up. ‘Quit’ was the call from my heart and I followed
Flowers at Chilligeri Estate
that religiously. After 15 minutes another bus came and before I could even see the ‘face’ of it, it was all filled up with all proportions.



‘Shit, what the hell’, I whispered.



I quit again and this ‘Quit Bus’ revolt concurred for another one hour or so. It was 2:00pm then and I knew that I had to travel another 36 kms, had to find a place and then had to proceed towards Irpu Falls. I could see my ‘Plan of Titanic’ was sinking in front of me and like Edward John Smith, I was giving blunt looks towards the sky for a ‘hope’. Noticing my struggle, one generous fellow walked in and said something in Kannada. With my ‘great’ understanding, this was it.



‘Where are you going?’, the guy asked



‘Kutta’, I replied with the correct pronunciation.



‘Take the bus over there’, he pointed the same which I just ‘quit’ some 10 minutes ago.



‘Too crowded, no place to stand even’, I expressed my frustration.



‘Yes, there’s a festival in Kutta, today and hence everyone is heading up
Flowers
there’, he smiled and said.



‘How would I go then?’, I almost cried with my lost soul.



‘There would be a bus from Kerala, which would be an express bus to Kutta, try for that’, he had shown a ray of light to me.



‘And how long I have to wait for that’, I asked with my sincere ‘inquisitiveness’.



‘5-10 minutes, oh ! here it is’, he said and ran.



I took the last part of the conversation and chased him as he was my ‘pace setter’. I saw one ‘very’ colorful bus just entered the stand and it seemed a lot of people were waiting to get un board from it. I used my pair of elbows to ‘win’ a seat and finally I managed. I was pretty happy with my success and it was a sigh of relief. The bus didn’t wait too long and surprisingly with ‘not much’ people, it hit the road. I later came to know that being an ‘express’ bus and so the high price of the tickets (may be 10 bucks more than the standard ones), local folks
Flowers
try to avoid this bus. ‘Whatever’, I focused on the ‘road’.



The drive from Gonnikoppal to Kutta was perhaps one of the ‘most scenic’ bus journeys I’ve ever had. Long winding roads though lush green coffee plantations that you can feel the freshness and aroma. Since I ‘prized’ myself with a window seat, I could sense the ‘splash’ of cold breeze. So refreshing that in 5 minutes, I forgot my ‘Quit Bus’ revolt and was really enjoying the scenes. The entire journey seemed to be the same through ‘estates’ and finally around 3:30pm the ‘Green Beauty’ (Eventually, it was the name of the bus) dropped me in Kutta. It was a small ‘modern village’ with a very few shops, That’s what I could describe Kutta at a first glance. I knew I had to search a place for the day. I rather decided to walk in to a nearby shop. I bought a pack of cigarette and stroke a ‘business conversation’. This is what I do mostly. In a new place, I usually find the most ‘knowledgeable’ shop, buy something and then ‘band up’ a ‘casual conversation’ to get the details about the place.


Irpu Falls

‘Sir, any place to stay here’, I started with my as usual ‘smile’.



‘Only one lodge here to the right. Try your luck’, he replied.



I was bit shocked that why to try my luck. ‘Were there a lot of tourists arrived before me?’, Asking those questions to myself, I ‘crawled’ towards the board which was ‘Kutta Lodge’. The place was empty, not even a stray cat or dog was there to greet me.



‘Hello, anybody here?’, I knocked at the reception desk.



And after a couple of more ‘hard knocks’, one old lady showed up.



‘What you want?’ was the question from her, in a rough ‘note’.



‘Rooms to stay tonight’, I asked



‘Nothing’, she shut both the doors up.



I walked back to the same shop and asked for ‘reason’.



‘Sir, today being the festival, most of the guys was either ‘drunk high’ or went to the temple. You would hardly find any one’, he replied with a smile. I didn’t know whether it was a ‘note of proud’ or a
Flowers
witty one.



I stood there ‘all blacked out’ for another 15-20 minutes. Suddenly I saw one guy with a ‘three wheeler’ just crossed past me. I ran to him and asked for his advice to find me a place to stay tonight. That guy seemed was ‘in shape’ and fortunately could speak Tamil. I literally dragged myself in before he could reply ‘yes,no or maybe’. He couldn’t give me any fruitful answer so I had to open my ‘Book of Notes’. Found a few and immediately started calling them. The cellphone network seemed pretty good here and after a few more tries, I managed to get hold of ‘The Chilligeri Estate’. It was a lady.



‘Maa’m, I came all the way from Chennai, any place to stay in your estate?’, I cried for help.



‘How many guys you are?’, was the question from the other end.



‘Just me, alone’, was my quick reply.



‘Okay, Rs. 1000 a day including all meals, come’, Was the deal offered to me.



‘Sure, how far?’, I asked



‘Get a taxi, drive through the
Inside Bhramhagiri WLS
Gonnikopal road for about 4 kms, find our ‘sign’, take left’, She finished all these words in 10 seconds maybe.



I had to stare at my ‘auto guy’, he seemed to have heard of this place before, but ‘what did she mean by taxi, I didn’t see any taxi here’, was the big question for me. The auto guy said that there was no taxi. All these ‘autos’ are referred as a taxis here. Incredible India ! he asked for Rs.50 to drop me to the estate. I agreed without any hesitation. We drove back through the same road I followed earlier and reached the estate within 15 minutes.



Wow ! Just Wow ! What a place to stay. Located in a remote valley with amazing Bramhagiri hills at the backdrop, amidst plenty of colorful flowers and coffee plantations, I really fell in love at the first sight. I was offered to have lunch and I decided to skip as I was ‘too late’ for The Irpu Falls which was some 6kms away from this place. Meanwhile I clinched a small ‘friendship’ with the auto guy,Pramod and without any minutes lost, I asked him
Inside Bhramhagiri WLS
to drop me to the base of Irpu Falls. I knew that there wouldn’t be any public transport available to reach Irpu Falls which would eventually be located inside the Bramhagiri Wild Life Sanctuary. Pramod offered me a nice option that he would drop me to the falls and once I was done with my ‘photos’ I would give him a call to pick me up from there. I liked this offer and we started again. In next 15 minutes or so I was at the entry point of Bramhagiri Sanctuary.



It’s inside the Sanctuary so one has to walk about a mile from the entry point to reach Irpu falls. No vehicles are allowed rather there are no roads to reach the base of the falls. Pramod dropped me there and warned me repeatedly to wind up before 6pm, as the presence of wild elephants was ‘high’ and that was for two reasons. One, all the water bodies up in the hill had dried up and Two, Elephants couldn’t resist themselves from tasting ‘Ripe Jackfruit’ so they prefer to come down to the estates. It was around 5pm and I knew I may run out of
Inside Bhramhagiri WLS
light to take photos. With his warnings framed on my mind, I entered the Bramhagiri Wild Life Sanctuary. It was a walk through thick woods following a narrow stream which was the continuation of the water from Irpu Falls. I noticed a couple of ‘sign boards’ which had it mentioned that the ‘Largest Breed of King Cobra’ was actually spotted in this region. I don’t know why but I am not too friendly with this animal so I got ‘spine chilling’ sensation. After a mile’s walk, I reached Irpu.



If you have seen Hebbe in Chickmagalur, Irpu is not that mighty roaring falls, nor even gorging from ‘high heights’ like Hebbe. But the surroundings with mighty Bramhagiri and the wilderness gave this place a ‘heavenly felling’. I didn’t find a lot of people there except some guys from a nearby college. They were spending their time enjoying the streams of Irpu. I looked for a place where I could place myself for some ‘silky water’ shots. I missed my tripod again and felt like ‘kicking my butt’. The watch was moving as fast as it could, and with the available ‘natural accessories’, I managed to place myself
Irpu Falls
on a ‘large stone’ and took a few photos. Though Irpu was a small waterfall compared to the ‘mightiest’ I have seen in India, I was in love with this place. It was so serene one could expect ever. However, with a huge ‘unwill’ , I decided to walk back to the ‘gate’ , meanwhile I called Pramod to be there in next 15 minutes. When I reached at the gate, Pramod was there already and we returned to the estate around 6:30 pm.



I saw that the owner ‘lady’ was trying to say something. So to bring them to the comfort level, I asked if anything that I could have helped. She said that they had to attend the festival at the temple so would it be okay, if I could stay here all alone in this estate till 9pm. Without any hesitation I asked them to go, and once they left I was hovering around the estate. What a beautiful place it was and if you were there with your ‘sweetheart’, I bet you couldn’t have expected more romantic place than this. Plenty of birds,singing the ‘music of nature’. I was not completely alone, I
Sunset from Chilligeri Estate
had company of a ‘little cute’ Lhasa Apso ‘Jimmy’. Being one of the greatest dog lovers on earth, I was enjoying every bit of his company. I tried a few sunset shots and finally around 7:30 pm it was completely dark. I was feeling a bit of scary and thrilled as well. I was recalling the words of Pramod regarding the jackfruit and elephant story. As I could see some Jackfruit trees around ‘showcasing’ some mighty ones hang. The climate was so cozy as if ‘mother nature’ had her A/C’s on. There was a completion which may be the best part of this trip, I had not seen so many stars and fire flies at the same place. Millions or Billions was the question unasked. After a few hours hovering at the estate, around 9:45 pm, they arrived. Then I realized the ‘burning stay of hunger’ in my stomach. I recalled that I didn’t have anything since morning except a couple of cups of coffee. The dinner was served within 15 minutes. Though I was asked about my options still I asked to make it as ‘Coorg’ as possible. It was one of the best I have ever had. Coorg Rotis made with Rice Flour, with a series of veg: preparations with a glass of homemade wine. Marvelous ! Proper justification to the Coorgi hospitality. I was too exhausted after having such a wonderful diner and I was seeing everything ‘blank’. I didn’t know how much I slept but woke up early at 6:30 am. As instructed, Pramod was there to pick me up. And expressing my heartfelt gratitude I said ‘good bye’ to Chilligeri estate for one last time. I knew that I would be back soon for my ‘sweetheart’. I definitely would like to get lost deep inside the forest with her. Missed you !

When last I wrote we were waiting to get picked up by Sagar to head up north to his new wife's hometown to have another reception there.

We were sort of used to the way timelines work in India by this point, so although we had been told we would be picked up at noon, we had a feeling that might not be the case. We opted to have a drink in our favourite ""Aqua Bar"" to wait it out. Eventually Sagar showed up with his family in what can only be described as a party bus! It was like a comfy 15 passenger travel van/bus with sweet blue/green lighting and a great sound system. The van was to take us (myself, Josh, Jeff, Vanessa, and Brodie) and Sagar, his parents, his aunt, and Deepa. It's a good think that it was a comfy ride, because the journey was actually a lot longer than we expected. It must have been at least 400km north and it took many hours.

On the way, Sagar showed me some of the pictures of the wedding photographer on his computer and explained some of the parts that were confusing to us during the actual ceremony. The rituals and symbolism was endless - I couldn't possibly rewrite it all. But many of the traditions were really sweet, like the ritual of seven steps to show devotion to husband and vice versa. He also explained to me the five things that married women wear: a red forhead spot, a nose peircing, flowers in her hair, a necklace, and a toe ring. Apprantly the numbers 5 and 11 are considered lucky in India. You do things like burn five sticks of incense, or give five or eleven types of fruit in a basket as a gift.

A bit over half way, we stopped for dinner in a small town. Sagar ordered us a giant spread of food, but shortly afterwards Deepa informed him that her mother was making a bunch of food for us in Havari, so we shouldn't eat a full dinner. Whoops! So we cancelled our order and switched to ""snacks,"" but the snack was pretty much still a full meal for me. I was somewhat dreading getting to Havari because I forsaw a whole bunch of food being placed in front of a very full me. Sure enough, that's what happened...

Deepa's house was pretty amazing. It was about three floors high with an open concept design and a big winding staircase up through it. It also had a nice landscaped courtyard which actually had lawn. When we came back the next day we discovered it's multiple beautiful rooftop terraces and - our favourite element - an indoor swing!! There is a specific Indian festival that uses the swing, but it can be played on at other times of the year.

Shortly after we arrived we sat down for food. There were only 6 spots set at the table and there were tons of us, so it was a bit awkward to figure out who was supposed to sit at the table. At the end I sat at the table while a few others sat on a nearby bench, but I knew I would regret that decision because it would prevent me from escaping from food consumption. They constantly put more and more food on my plate and I felt so badly having to refuse, but I just couldn't do it. Some people have stomachs which seem to be able to expand to accomodate whatever is necessary - I am not htat way. I just can't eat if I'm not hungry, no matter how much pressure I feel. I hate it because food is so often a social thing and I frequently find myself feeling rude for having to decline food while others are just trying to be good hosts. This night was no different. The food was delicious, but the quantity was so much! Once we finished the bus took us to the small nearby hotel we would be staying the night in. The rest stayed behind because Deepa's family is quite orthodox and normally the men eat first and then the women, so half the group still had to eat. Whoops... should I not have eaten or not have sitten at the table? Sagar said it was fine. Ah well.

Considering we were in such a small town the ""VIP Suites"" which we were housed in were actually pretty nice. I wasn't sure what kind of accomodation they would have for us. Certainly no internet there, though! No toilet paper either, but luckily I'm always prepared =) The best part of where we were staying was the rooftop courtyard. I thought it would have been nice to sleep out there under the stars, but there were a whole number of guys who seemed to work for the hotel that slept out there, instead! I thought maybe they just didn't have anywhere else to sleep, but Sagar said they were there in case we needed anything in the middle of the night. Yikes! I am not used to the amount of ""attending to"" that we get in India. People are always serving food onto our plates instead of just leaving a serving dish on the table, or bringing our bags around, or just kind of hovering.

We were told to meet Sagar's parents at the reception for breakfast at 9am, but when we tried to find them they weren't there, and we weren't sure where we should be going. This didn't really surprise us, again, due to loose timelines here, so we just went back up to the rooftop and we all took some time to read in the shade. At one point, some guys silently brought over some little dixie cups of something hot (tea? coffee? there is so much milk and sugar we couldn't tell), which was pretty good. Around an hour later a nice man came to get us and told us to come down to the basement for breakfast. It turns out that we WERE supposed to have gone down at 9am, but we just didn't know what to do. So once we never turned up various phonecalls were made and this gentleman took us under his wing. Thanks goodness, because would have been lost. We sat in a row along a long silver table and were served some pretty tasty curries on palm leaves. After that, we were directed to the bus, which took us back to Deepa's house. It seemed that people were a bit surprised to see us there, but we were just following directions! This whole day was rather confusing.

We hung out with Deepa and got to know her better. She showed us the rest of her house, including the network of solar panels on the roof which are used to heat water for the house. She said that their set up was an older model, but they didn't want to upgrade because the monkeys would destroy the pipes! Sure enough, a metal tank up there was full of dents from them. I had no idea monkeys could do so much damage! We also enjoyed watching the wild pigs off the roof, frolicking in the garbage. Deepa had to go change into her wedding clothes for the next, and final, reception, so we amused ourselves on the indoor swing. The reception was supposed to start at noon but I think it was probably around 1pm when the bride and groom headed over in a cute red car decorated with flowers and signs.

This reception seemed a bit less formal and the atmosphere seemed a bit more fun than the other events. There were probably around 200 people in attendance, but Deepa seemed to know most of the people there and both she and Sagar appeared to have a good time. Vanessa and I weren't really dressed up when it started because we had just been shuttled around all morning without sense of what was happening when, but after sitting amongst everyone in their faciest saris we eventually became self-conscious and went upstairs to change into nicer clothes (the reception was in the hotel where we were staying). I took the opportunity to get one last use out of my pink Indian outfit that the Dugani's had bought for me. I love it!

These receptions have two parts: greeting the bride and groom on stage, blessing them, then getting a picture taken, and EATING. After we had done our bit on stage we were ready to eat. The giant lunch was in the basement area where we had had breakfast. Man, what a production!! The whole things was a finally organized, if slightly chaotic appearing, enterprise. Everyone was seated along rows of long tables. A long roll of paper tablecloth was laid out, and then the procession of servers began. They would slap down palm leaves and bottles of water (then people would wash their palm leaves with the water, we noted for our turn). Then various servers with buckets and ladles would whizz by dowling out curries and chutneys and breads and a bunch of things which were totally unknown to me. This would continue until no one could eat any more. Then the diners would stand up and leave, the table cloth-paper would be rolled up with all the palm leaves, the table would be wiped down, and the process would start again for the next seating. It was pretty impressive! It was a bit hard to get a spot, mind you, but fortunately, again, a few people took us under their wing and secured us a seating. After we sat down there was a loooong wait before anything happened, and we weren't really sure what was going on. Turns out they had ran out of paper roll, so everything had to be held up until some new paper could be acquired. It was worth the waiting, though. Mmmmm such good food! Probably my best meal in India. (Sagar told us later that the hotel guys were super happy that we enjoyed the meal).

Oh! And I forgot about the roti bread man! There was a guy set up in the corner with a giant hot plate in front of him. He must have been dying from heat, but he was great at what he does. Basically, he would scoop up batter from a giant bat and pour it onto the grill in perfectly sized circle pancakes. Dip, pour, dip, pour, dip, pour. He had real rhythm to it, working with his right hand and keeping his left hand on his hip, with kind of a pelvic thrust each time he poured. Then he would grab the spatula and flip flip flip! Some extra spices and greens of some kind were sprinkled on, then they would all get flopped into a giant bowl, ready to eat. Yum!

We were supposed to be on the road back to Bangalore by 3pm (the day before we were told noon...) but we knew that wasn't going to happen so we just went up to the rooftop and read until someone came to get us. Around 5pm, it was finally time to hit the road. We stopped off at Deepa's house to say final goodbyes. It was so touching to see the way the two families had bonded already. There was lots of love between them, that much was obvious. Deepa was staying in Havari for a few more weeks because she has to write her final engineering exams, then she will come to Bangalore to live with Sagar's family. From now on, she ""belongs"" to Sagar's family (but only in the sense that she's like their daughter, it's not a repressive thing). We were supposed to stop at a cousin's for tea, but mercifully we skipped that as it was getting late and we had a long, long drive back to Bangalore.

I think it was around 1am when we reached our hotel. For a lot of that journey I was glad I was in the back and couldn't see out the front very well. Ignorance is bliss when it comes to road travel for me in most developing countries, and this journey was certainly no exception. Rickshaw travel in the city is nuts, but at least you don't travel very quickly. Highway speeds with rickshaw-style weaving is a whole other ballgame. We did get a reminder of the dangers of the road, though. We passed an accident scene where a big SUV-type vehicle had hit and killed a bull. The bull was dead, but the vehicle was in pretty bad shape, too. I guess it's like hitting a moose back in Canada.

I think I'll end this entry here, and start another one for the post-wedding happenings.

The day after the final reception, everyone was ready for a little R&R. It had been a wild few days! Sagar really wanted to plan a special day for us, especially since it was the last day for the boys in India, so he took us to a resort just outside the city limits.

It was Sagar himself who picked us up from our hotel, and we managed to squeeze 6 of us in to his tiny compact surprisingly comfortably. I'm so impressed that Sagar can drive here - I think that's why he's such a calm guy in Toronto. If you can drive here, surely nothing can phase you! He took us to his family home where we transfered into a much larger car which could accomodate all of us, and which came with a driver. I realize now that an advantage of having a driver is not just the not-having-to-drive part, but also that you don't have to find parking really. They can just drop you off and swing back around when you need them. As you can imagine, parking is often at a premium in such a dense city.

The resort was gorgeous. It was like a huge, tropical, gated community with a mix of privately owned vacation condos and hotel suites, with resort amenities like a fitness club, spa, and big pool. We were especially taken by the pool because it has been so hot here and our hotel in Bangalore doesn't have one. After a buffet lunch (at which I pretty much couldn't eat anything, my stomach had finally quit), we took a walk around the beautiful grounds. I have to admit I felt someone like an exploitive British colonialist here, but I pushed the thoughts aside and just tried to soak in the serenity of the place. There were so many beautiful lush bushes, flowers, and birds - wonderful! Finally, it was pool time! While Sagar napped (well deservedly) on the pool deck, the rest of us changed into bathing suits and started playing. There was a big waterfall that you could sit under, and some polo balls we found provided endless entertainment. All in all, it was a really nice afternoon.

OK, I realize by this point you're probably thinking that I haven't exactly been slumming it during this trip, and you are partially right. But what can you do when your hosts are this kind?

After we had changed and dried off, we loaded back in the car to head back into town. We were going to a tourist area called MG road (Mahatma Gandhi, of course) to pick up some souvenirs. Also, Vanessa really needed to get a SIM card for her cell phone because she is staying here for a while after we leave, and we needed Sagar's help because we have had NO success in getting this thing. When she finally found a place that actually sold them, they told her they needed a copy of her passport! So she and Sagar set off to do that, while Josh, Brodie, Jeff, and I poked in nearby shops. In one shop, a really nice sales guy helped us out and I acutally bought quite a bit from him because he wasn't push at all. I mean, he was encouraging the upsell, for sure, but he was reasonable and calm about it. Earlier I had gone into a textiles place and instantly people were literally yelling at me and shoving products in my face. I hate that. I just ran away. No sale for them! Eventually Vanessa and Sagar returned with photocopy and 15 passport photos in hand (don't ask), and she got her SIM card. She was told it would be activated by the next night, but when she left me the next evening it still wasn't working... I hope it gets activated eventually.

Finally, it was time for the great day and the group travel to come to an end. The car dropped me and Vanessa off at the hotel (she would be sleeping in my room that night) and the boys picked up their luggage. They were all going back to Sagar's house for about an hour, then Sagar would drive them to the airport. Their trip is far from over - they were flying straight to Cambodia, and they are still going to Japan after that! It was crazy to say goodbye and realize I would really only see them for a couple weeks around convocation, then I will be moving to Calgary and we will be living apart for at least the next five years. For the past year I've been living in the same apartment building with them all, and it's been great.

When I got up to my room with Vanessa, I took the opportunity to catch up on emails. Ooooh boy was there a lot of them. I had a bunch of high priority, time sensitive Scout documents to review and a number of issues for school to deal with. It seemed that we still didn't have a speaker for convocation, which was supposed to be my job and I was really stressed about it. It had been a long few days and I was literally falling asleep at my computer by the time I shut it down. V and I decided not to set alarms for the next morning...

The next day, Tuesday, it was just Vanessa and I on our own. Our group had gotten so small! We had planned to hire a car to go to Bandipur National Park to do a wildlife safari this day after failing to make it happen on Friday, but during some late night browsing Vanessa had discovered the park was closed on Tuesday! Argggghhhh!! We had spent so much time figuring this out, too. At least we made the discovery before we got all the way there. So we spent a good portion of the morning trying to figure out a plan B. Honestly, getting around this city is really, really difficult. Every time we come up with an idea we have to work out how close it is, if we could possibly rickshaw there, will traffic be OK. Then there is the problem of figuring out where things are. See, we had wanted to check out a temple or two. There were a few good ones listed, but when we tried to look up their location it wasn't clear at all. Google maps would list multple locations for all of them. Others were too far out of the city.

Forget it.

In the end, we decided to go to the botanical gardens. It turned out to be a great choice! Sagar had said they had fallen into a bit of disrepair and I think that was true for a number of the areas, but overall the area was a green oasis in the middle of the city. We really enjoyed walking around. I particularly enjoyed looking at the different birds living there, which were similar to Canadian birds but not quite the same. A kind of bird Twighlight Zone. Like, there were sort of cormorants, but different. And harks, finches, and ravens that just weren't the same. There were some bird interpretive posters around but I couldn't match up any of the birds that I was seeing to those. There were lots of families in the gardens, which was nice to see. We made the mistake of engaging (only briefly, but that was enough) with some little hooligans over by a GIANT tree that we wanted to take a picture in. The followed us for like 15 minutes yelling for money. We hadn't experienced anything like that during our time here. We really didn't know how we were going to get rid of them because they clearly had nothing else to do then pester us (which they thought was hilarious), but we found an unlikely saviour in the form of a dog. There were dogs lying all over the gardens (including a very cute beagle!) but when we got to the edge of a lake, this one dog just started snarling and barking and lunging at the kids, who jumped behind benches for safety and forgot about us. I imagine they had not been good to that dog in the past, because I didn't see them do anything to him then. We made our escape, but kept one eye open for the little pack the rest of the time.

Unfortunately, we picked the hottest day of our whole trip for this outdoor excursion. Honestly, it was difficult to breathe it was so hot and humid. We ended up only being in the gardens for an hour but it seemed waaay longer than that, and we were completely wiped afterward. We had planned to walk around the area afterward and see what we could find, but after less than 5 minutes of heat stroke, crazy traffic, and a sidewalk-free neighbourhood, we gave up and flagged the first rickshaw we could find to take us to the sanctuary of an airconditioned mall. Hey, it was really, really hot, OK? Don't judge! We were just so exhausted we couldn't imagine doing anything else, so we went back to the movie theatre we had gone to earlier with Anjali. We considered watching a Bollywood movie, but in the end we went for an English one, that new Tim Burton one called Dark Shadows. The best part, though? The seats!!! The entire theatre was filled with lazy-boy style airchairs that fully reclined. They were so plush and cozy. Vanessa and I were in heaven. It may not have been a very cultural experience, but it was definitely the right choice for us at the time. The movie was better than I expected it to be, too.

When we exited the theatre we were hit with an unpleasant surprise: there was pretty much a monsoon happening outside. Like, serious torrential downpour. The kind where you are instantly drenched just from stepping out from undercover. Everyone was hoarding around the mall foyer because no one wanted to go out in it. I had actually been carrying around either a raincoat or an umbrella for most of the trip, but this particular day I had left them at the hotel. We waited around 20 minutes but there was no sign of it letting up, so figured we had better face the fact that we were going to get wet. We ran out into the rain and pretty much got into the first rickshaw we saw. We paid more than we should have but we didn't care - it was worth it to get home.

What followed was the most harrowing ride of the trip, which is saying something. The roads were all flooded, and our driver was young and wild. He also didn't have a windshield wiper (note to self: next time it's raining make sure you get in a rickshaw with a wiper). He kept taking one way roads the wrong way and driving through puddles and rivers that were so deep they would come up into the rickshaw. At one point we almost stalled out and I was SO worried we were going to get stuck but, miraculously, we made it. Phew. Now, we were wet and freezing. Quite a change from our heat exhaustion of earlier in the day!

Vanessa had another hurdle to pass at this point. She was supposed to go to an aunt's for supper and then go to her friend's apartment, where she will be staying for the rest of time. As I have said many times, though, travel is hard for us here and now she would have her big suitcase with her. She also didn't think a rickshaw driver would know how to find her aunt's address. It's hard to phone a cab becasue we don't have cell numbers which they require, and it is a constant struggle and negotiation with the hotel to make local calls here. EVENTUALLY she secured a cab to take her, and after a half hour's wait it arrived. I hear it screwed her over in terms of price, though, and then it supposedly ""didn't have change,"" either. Sigh. I'm not looking forward to getting to the airport tonight.

Vanessa left just in time, as I was hit with a rather unpleasant bout of traveller's diarrhea shortly after. Not a great night. But it in terms of timing I couldn't have asked for anything better. I was planning to take it easy today anyway. I got some drugs from the pharmacy this afternoon so I should be in better shape for my 24 hours or travel back to Canada tonight (I hope!). I changed from a window to an aisle seat, though, just in case =)

And that pretty much wraps up my India trip! I felt like this blog was a lot less fun and descriptive than my previous world tour ones. I think I was busier on this trip so it was harder to fit it in. Oh well. I think my pictures tell a better story of the journey. I'll put them up when I get home.

Bye until the next adventure!

***Note: I wrote this days ago (Saturday morning) but haven't had internet access since, so I couldn't upload it. Now it's Monday night and I haven't written anything else! I also don't have a fast enough connection to upload any pictures. Sorry! Hopefully tomorrow night I can summarize the past few days events. In the meantime, here is a tome to finish off last week.***



The internet seems to have cut out (good bye 100 rupees) so I’ll write this entry in Word and hopefully I can upload it later.



I think last night when I stopped writing I had finished the part about the engagement party. The next morning we all woke up, ate the delicious hotel breakfast, and then got dressed up for the wedding. Sagar’s family had bought us all amazing Indian clothing to wear for the occasion, which was amazing of them to do. Quite frankly, we looked awesome! The boys looked especially great in their outfits. By the way, I’m travelling with some in-law whisperers here. You know those kind of guys that can work a family reunion and have all the relatives gushing over them? Yep, that’s these boys. They are really great with everyone.



I should mention that this was a south Indian wedding, which is a bit different than the north Indian weddings which I think are a little bit more well known. I’m told north Indian weddings have the groom ride in on a horse and there is lots of dancing, etc. This one had a lot of blessings and rituals, but a bit less spectacle, I would say. So when we arrived at the wedding Sagar and Deepa were both up a the front of a giant room under a lavishly decorated tent awning. We had already missed a few things, like them playing a game where they fish in a vat of milk for their wedding rings. The tent was decorated with reams and reams of strands of fresh flowers. I’m not completely sure what was going on, but they were kneeling down and being dressed up a bit. Sagar had on a decadent turban and an additional headdress of jewels was being tied on. Eventually the couple left and then just Sagar returned. He went through a long time of blessings with a priest (?) where he had to touch various things, have various garlands put on, have candles waved around him, etc. We couldn’t see everything because often the camera people were in the way, but we had a decent view. The atmosphere was pretty casual. We were free to talk and wander around as we pleased.



Then Deepa came in and did the same thing. Next there was a big white sheet put up between the two and I think they were blessing each other (?). The sheet was dropped and much more blessing and rituals took place. Eventually the key part occurred: they exchanged golden necklaces and voila! They were married Then we all got to throw coloured rice at them. I liked that part. (I may not have the order of all of this quite correct). Next a big receiving line was formed and we all went up on stage without shoes to sprinkle rice on their heads and wish the couple good luck.



From there, it was time for lunch! (food has not been an issue on this trip!) Another big Indian buffet. After lunch we went back in to the wedding room for a bit because we were told the couple was going to do a fire ceremony of some kind, which sounded neat. However time waned on and we weren’t sure when it was going to happen, so we decided to make our exit. We were going to head to a mall to watch a Bollywood movie – the true Indian experience! First, of course, we did a photo shoot of us in our awesome clothing. I look like a giant in all the “girls only” pictures, however, because Anjali and Vanessa are both super small. In fact Vanessa is the shortest person in our entire class. When the boys are in, things balance out.

OK, so, we went back to our rooms to change out of our fancy Indian clothes and into western clothes to hit the mall. This time we weren’t going to mess around with cabs – we just walked up to the road and grabbed some rickshaws. Much easier! I’ll try to take a video of rickshawing later. It’s a bit of an adventure and not for the faint of heart, but it’s actually my favourite way to travel here. You get a nice cool breeze and if anything seems like it’s not quite right, you can just get out. Plus, no one is able to go very fast in the bad traffic so I feel like if we got hit we wouldn’t get TOO hurt (my mom just had a heart attack when reading that).



Once in the mall we went up to the top level (there were like five or six – it’s a huge mall!) and bought tickets for a showing. Anjali picked a good one out for us which had both action/adventure for the boys, and choreographed dance numbers for me. Perfect! We had a bit of time before the movie started so we split up to explore the mall. Jeff, Brodie and I happened upon “Play Salon” which had an unsecured wireless connection, so we loitered outside of there for a while with our smartphones. I think this mall is fairly new, and I got the impression that Bangalore doesn’t have a lot of buildings with escalators in them. At every escalator (and there are many with so many floors) there were at least two security guards stationed, armed with whistles. You got whistled at for EVERYTHING. Not facing forward, being too close to the person in front of you, being under a certain age without a parent, standing too close to the entrance or exit, or even walking up/down the escalator. At first I thought it was a bit ridiculous, but actually I can see why they need it. Having grown up with escalators I take them for granted, but I can see how they would be tricky to navigate if you weren’t used to it. I saw many people have trouble stepping on the correct moving step when boarding, and lots of time people would step off at the top and just stop right there. I even saw two kids fall, seemingly from a steady standing position. Still, though, it was annoying for us Canadian “rebels” to constantly get whistled at because we were riding backwards to talk to each other or walking down the escalator to speed up the ride. Come on, people, we have advanced escalator skills!



When it was time for the movie we met up outside the theatre entrance. There were separate entrances for guys and girls. There we were given the third degree and our bags were checked. There were bag checks and metal detectors going in to the mall, too (although they were useless because they constantly beeped and no one cared) but these checks were not for security. They were looking for cameras. I think movie pirating is a big problem here. My camera snuck through undetected, but Vanessa got caught. They made her take out her battery and check it, plus fill out all kinds of paperwork. Finally, once we were all in, the others grabbed some snacks and we headed in to the theatre. They have assigned seating at these movies, which would have been good since our group was so large, but actually this movie wasn’t very full. Anj told us that usually when the theatre is really full there is a lot of cat calling and heckling at the screen, but there wasn’t much of that during our movie. It was a much more relaxed atmosphere though with much giggling and whispering than would be acceptable at home. This was a good thing because the movie was in Hindi, so Anjali, poor thing, spent the whole film whispering translation to us. Granted, the plot wasn’t that elaborate so we could follow along fairly well on our own, but it was nice to have a guide. It was surprisingly violent! Also there were some make out scenes and a sex scene. Apparently ten years ago there wasn’t even kissing allowed in Bollywood movies, but times have clearly changed. I actually liked it a lot. The cinematography was surprisingly good – much better than the old ones you see on YouTube. It really is a huge industry here. The films are long, too. There was even an intermission in the middle!



Once the movie was finished it was time to grab rickshaws and get back to the hotel to get ready for the reception. It turns out the reception was at a different hotel, which meant that we had to negotiate transportation again. We didn’t want to take rickshaws because we would be wearing nice clothes, so we asked the hotel to call us a cab. Long story short, we ended up having to get two expensive cars at 300 ruppees each for a trip which was seriously just down the road. We were cutting it close, though, and we just needed to get there. When the cars showed up we got in and confirmed the price. Then the drivers starting saying “ohhh LE Meridian? I thought you were talking about a different hotel” then he demanded 500 rupees! At this point, Anjali lost it. We had been getting screwed by various drivers all day and she had had enough. She started yelling at the driver things like, “no! That is unacceptable! It’s just around the corner! 300 rupees was the deal! I’ve had enough of these games!” etc etc. It was actually kind of funny, especially since Anjali couldn’t speak Hindi well enough to get the words out when she was mad, so the whole tirade was in English. And if you know Anjali, you know she is really mild mannered in general so to hear her raise her voice at all was quite a change, but probably didn’t seem that intense to a bystander. Anyhow, we all calmed down, we arrived, we paid our 300 rupees and disembarked.



The hotel where the reception was held was absolutely gorgeous. I’m sure it was one of the nicest in Bangalore. Sagar was waiting in the lobby when we arrived and it was great to get a chance to chat with him. It was the first time I had been able to talk to him since he picked me up from the airport. After some more photos we thought we should leave him to his hosting duties, so we headed down to the reception. This event had even more people than the wedding, and a huge ballroom was full of chairs. We managed to score a round table at the side though, which made a nice home base. Sagar’s dad is an influential cardiologist here so there were many powerful people in attendance, including various ministers and industry leaders. This event was a lot about photos (again!) but we also did another receiving line to wish the couple our blessing. The line seemed to never end! I don’t know how many people were there, but it was a lot. There was also a ton of food. The buffet items stretched the entire wall length. We had been hoping for dancing, but the crowd was waning and still nothing had happened. There was a good band playing a mix of Indian music and western covers, but everyone seemed content to listen. We were just contemplating leaving when all of a sudden, one of Sagar’s young cousins starting busting a move (she was a great dancer!). Next thing we knew, Sagar’s DAD was breaking it down! I don’t think anyone expected that. Then even Sagar was heading over and beckoning us to follow. Now, this was exciting. I have known Sagar for four years and I have never seen him dance ONCE. Before long, everyone who was left had congregated in front of the band and a huge spontaneous dance party broke out. Sagar and Deepa looked great dancing together, and they both seemed really happy, which was nice to see. It was super fun, and our group learned some excellent new Indian dance moves. I think Jeff was the best – he fit right in!



Finally, after yet more pictures, the night came to a close. Sagar arranged for some cars to take us back to our hotel. Oh, and Sagar’s brother-in-law presented us with some Indian sweets to “take on our journey.” So nice!



We had Friday free of wedding-related activities, so we were hoping to head out of the city for a day trip. We had made friends with one of Sagar’s wedding guests the day before, and she had offered to help us book a car to take us to a National Park just outside of town since we had such difficulty arranging transportation. Everything was all set up, and for a great price. We work up, had breakfast, and got suited up for our safari adventure. The car was supposed to arrive at 9:30 for a 10am departure. Nothing at 9:30. Nothing at 10am. Nothing at 10:30… We weren’t entirely sure what to do. We didn’t have a number for the company, and we foolishly hadn’t even gotten the number of our friend. So we asked the hotel to call Sagar to ask him to call his friend to find out what the deal was. We weren’t sure who exactly the hotel spoke to, but the end result was that the person was going to try to sort things out and call us back. Thirty minutes later, still no call back! I won’t go through everything, but basically the plan changed around 15 times and it was a constant game of telephone tag and miscommunication, with Sagar’s family and his friend doing their absolute best to help us. In the end, a few hours later, we found out the car company had all of their cars booked. This was fine, as we were ready to give up anyway. By this point we were exhausted and decided to have a drink in the bar to chill out. The bar was actually pretty awesome – a hidden gem we hadn’t noticed before. It was called “Aqua bar” and it had this sweet underwater theme, complete with a wall made of saltwater fish tanks.



Finally, we were ready to leave the hotel lobby. We grabbed rickshaws to the Bangalore Palace which had been recommended to us. It turned out it was going to cost 400 rupees to go inside, including an audio guide, and not everyone was in to that. But we had come all the way there so we decided to bite the bullet and go for it. I’m really glad we did! The palace was giant and really neat. The audio guide was excellent, as well. Basically, it was a castle inspired by English architecture, used to house the local rulers during British Colonial times. There were all kinds of cool artifacts, including stools made of elephant feet and an ingenious bench which was actually a scale to weigh jockeys on. There were many old photos of palace life and exotic hunts. Quite a different time. Unfortunately it cost more than admission to be allowed to take photos, so I don’t have any pictures to share.



After the palace we wanted to head generally back to the mall from the day before, because Vanessa needed to buy a cell phone and SIM card for use during her time here. We opted to walk in order to see more of the area. It was a bit of a journey but with the help of an iPhone map that Jeff had downloaded earlier and some persistent navigation skills by Vanessa, we made it!



I have to say, the people in Bangalore are generally really great. We never get hassled here like I often do in other developing countries. No one is pulling at our arms and trying to sell us stuff, or yelling at us asking where we’re from. They’ll maybe stare a bit and we’ll exchange smiles and hellos, but that’s it. And they always are helpful when we need to ask directions. It ‘s really quite nice.



Finally, we made it to the mall and all split up to acquire food and drink. We were exhausted! Vanessa attempted to buy her cell phone but was told to come back at 5pm because the man who sells SIM cards would be back then . When we came back, we were told he would be back the next day. What?? How do you sell cell phones without SIM cards? Despite the whole area being full of cell phone shops, none had SIM cards for her. Oh well.



Next we took rickshaws to a McDonalds near our hotel. I always love to try the local cultural McDonalds specialty when I’m in a new country, and it turns out the rest of the group is the same. This McDonalds had all kinds of exotic things to try! I went for the McTikki Ackaloo (I think that’s what it was called). It was kind of like a falafel patty with peas in it, normal burger toppings, and a spicy Chiptole-type sauce. It was great! Although on first bite I forgot I wasn’t eating and normal burger and was surprised when a pea popped in to my mouth.



After MickeyDee’s we walked back to our hotel and chilled out for a few hours before heading out on the town. We wanted to check out a bar up on the 13th floor of a hotel. It was pricey, but it was a fun atmosphere and the view was great. Interestingly, the curfew for bars here is 11:30, and by 11:00 pretty much everyone had left and the lights were coming on. Time to leave! We were a bit nervous about whether we would be able to get a rickshaw back but luckily some were waiting outside. We had to pay a bit more than we probably should have, but I didn’t mind at all. We had just dropped a ton of money at that bar and it was raining and cold, so I thought that rickshaw driver totally deserved the fare.



The boys and Vanessa stayed up a bit more to finish of the “wine” from the other day, but I went back to my room to update the travelblog.



That pretty much brings us to today! Today should be really fun. We’re checking out of our hotel to head north to town where Deepa is from. I think Sagar needs to spend a night in their home as part of the ceremony, and there will be another reception there. It will be great to see a smaller town. Right now we’re just waiting for a car to come get us… we’ll see if it shows up! =)



OK, I’ve been a hermit all morning so I should probably go hang out with the others. I wonder if they’re in the Aqua bar….

How to go Muthathi from banglaore


Muthathi is about 100 kms from Bangalore via kanakapura. You have to go to Kanakapura first (60+ kms), then from kanakapura to Sathanur (18 kms) on National highway 209, from Sathanur take a left turn to Muthathi (18 kms). Bheemeswari is 5 kms from Muthathi on Halagur Road.



If you are coming from Mysore in Mallavalli road, you have to come to Halagur, from Halagur take a right turn to Bheemeshwari (20 kms), from Bheemeshwari further 5 kms to Muthathi.

Busses are frequent upto Kanakapura, but less frequent from Sathanur to Muthathi. Although one may go by bus, it is better to go by own vehicle, because there are 2-3 picnic spots 2 –3 kms before Muthathi, where you can halt. Besides if you have own vehicle you can halt at hanuman temples on the way and go to bheemeswari (5kms).
What is there to see near Muthathi


Muthathi is surrounded by hills from all sides. While going from Sathanur the road goes down steep with sharp bends from the hills 5 kms before Muthathi and again climbs up steep with hairpin bends after 7 kms on the other side (after 2 kms from Bheemeshwari) towards Halagur.

You will see nice hills view when you are on the hills 5 kms before Muthathi. The trees and environment will look like any hill station. This picture is taken on Sathanur-Muthathi road, 5 kms before Muthathi.



After this hills view, the road will go down sharp to the valley. Thereafter you will find a temple of lord Hanuman, called as Padadhara Anjaneya swami temple. This temple seems to be very popular as most passers by halt at this temple to have darshan of the lord.



After hanuman temple you will find river Kavery on the left and 2 to 3 picnic spots on the river side before reaching Muthathi. If it is a holiday or picnic hour you can see people gathering in the picnic spot. Otherwise you can recognize these picnic spots by seeing pathway going down towards river and paper plates or other such picnic materials thrown here and there.



All these picnic spots before Mthathi and Muthati itself are Kaveray river spots. These are the pictures during summer in May when there is very less water in the river. The granite bed of the river gives very attractive view.



There is another hanuman temple in Muthathi, known as Muthetharaya temple. This temple has some mythological importance. When Devi Sita was taking bath at this place, her nose stud fell down in the river. Hanuman came to the place, found the stud and returned to Sita devi. That’s why Hanuman got the name Muthetharaya here.

It was early May when we went Muthathi this time. Because of summer season, tThere was very less water in the river. We could see the beautiful black granite stones on the river bed and walk over them.

The cows and bull s in Muthathi are very beautiful having extremely long horns (more than 2 feet), pointed and sharp, looking very attractive.



While in Muthathi we saw a crowd carrying some god on their shoulders for visharjan (dipping in water). The god was sitting on a tiger and the crowd was screaming as “Govinda..Govinda..”. They kept the palki near the river and did pooja and visharjan thereafter.



After spending some time in Muthathi we went towards Bheemeshwari. Bheemeshwari is 5 kms from Muthathi. There is also another Hanuman temple called “Rama Anjaneya swami temple” (picture below) on the way and a river spot in front of the temple.



The river Kavery in front of the temple is extremely beautiful (picture below). The temple is on the right side of the road and river is on the left side (while coming from Muthathi). The place is cool and nice to take bath.



After Ramanjaneya temple you have go further for Bheemeshwari. In Bheemeshwari, you will find a temple called BheemaLingeswar Temple (below).



On the other side you will find Bheemeswari Adventure and Nature Camp and Kavery Fishing Camp. They charge 1300/- per person for day trip and much more for night halts. You have to book before hand for the nature and fishing camps.


Food and halting


There is no food (no habitation) in Bheemeswari. Although there is no good hotel in Muthathi, you can find a couple of places to take food. Besides you can get chips and cold drinks here. Sathanur is a bigger place having more places to eat, although none of them is of good standard. Kanakapura gives you many good places to eat.

We took south Indian meals at sathanur which was simple but ok. On the way back we took Masala Dosa on a better looking hotel in Kanakpura, although the taste was just OK.

There is no accommodation available in Muthathi or nearby. However, accommodation is available at Bheemeswari Jungle lodges which is expensive and not worth for people who can return back on the same day.
Summary


Thus we halted at and covered several points around muthathi which include the following.

- hills view 5 kms before muthathi

- Padadhara anjaneya swami temple

- 2 picnic spots before Muthathi

- Muthathi kavery view, the main point

- Ramanjaneya swami temple on Muthathi Bheemeswari road - the kavery view there too

- Bheema Lingeswar temple in Bheemeswari

- Bheemeswari nature camp and Kavery fishing camp (from outside only)

- Hills view 2 kms after Bheemeshwari towards halagur. The road climbs steep on the hills with hairpin bends and gives a beautiful view of the valley (picture below).


Caution and warning


Muthathi like many other Kavery water spots look very calm and quiet. But there are strong water currents in many places and crocodiles too. Although it is very attractive to bath or swim in the river, it is very dangerous to get into the water. Many people loose their lives every year in kavery baths.
Other places around


There are few other places which can be covered on the same day along with Muthathi.

- Sangama, the confluence of river Arkavati and Kavery (40+ kms from Muthathi, 95 kms from Bangalore)

- Mekedatu (45 kms from Muthathi, 100 Kms from Bangalore)

- Chunhi Falls (35 kms from Muthathi, 85 kms from Bangalore)

- Pyramid Valley (55 kms from Muthathi, 50 Kms from Bangalore)

May 11th 2012

Yikes! Days have passed since I arrived in India and this is my first blog update. That means I'll inevitably forget tons of fun tidbits as I try to cram in all the craziness of the start of this adventure. Also, it's late at night and I might just run out of steam... let's see how far I can get.

First, a little background on this trip. Basically, I'm on a break between the end of medical school and the start of residency. Most everyone I know in my class has taken the opportunity to travel to some part of the world, so I thought I would follow suit. As luck would have it, my good friend from my class, Sagar, was scheduled to get married in Bangalore, India, during this time and the dates worked out perfectly for me to make the trek. A bunch of other close friends from school are here, too. Josh, Jeff, Brodie, and Vanessa are here for pretty much my whole trip, and Anjali and Kamini met up with us for the engagement/wedding (more on that later). So overall, it's a great crew for a great adventure!

Bangalore used to be known as the Garden City of India, but now it is more famous for its tech industry. It's considered the Silicon Valley of the region and is also home to a lot of call centers. Literacy levels are really high and the English language is prevelant.

Just by chance, Vanessa and I booked ourselves on the same flights from Toronto to Bangalore. The trip was pretty smooth and generally uneventful. We stumbled upon Mike and Matt, also from our class, in the departures lounge at YYZ, though, because the poor guys had been delayed over 12 hours trying to get to London. Luckily we didn't have anything like that on our trip! The big hiccup for me was the lack of internet access in Frankfurt during our stopover. Honestly, what major airports don't have internet access these days? I had a bunch of emails I needed to send and reply to which I didn't get to before I left (it was a WHIRLWIND week prior to departure, with writing my medicince licensing exam, a marathon weekend of Scouts Board meetings, conducting interviews for a hiring committee, and then signing lease papers and sending money for my new place in Calgary). I have an even longer stop over there on the way back. Wasted time frustrates me.

We arrived in Bangalore at 00:30. We were pretty sure that someone was going to meet us at the airport, but we didn't know exactly who or where or... much (this would be a recurring theme). But once we landed I texted Brodie and he said they were waiting for us, and sure enough, after exiting the airport we had Jeff, Josh, Brodie, and Sagar all there to welcome us with big hugs! What troopers - it was like 1:30am by the time we left and the trip back to the hotel took about 45 minutes. We had two cars: one was driven by a hired driver but Sagar drove the other one himself. If you could see the roads here you would know how impressive that is! At least traffic is way reduced at night time. The other car actually got lost, but we all made it to our hotel eventually. I had slept great on the plane from Frankfurt, but I had not trouble sleeping well in my hotel bed once I settled in, too. I think I have two years of sleep deprivation to correct (before I get started on the next five years of sleep deficit!).

The next morning (or, I suppose, later that same morning) we woke and had an excellent breakfast at the hotel. They have a huge breakfast buffet every morning which is included with our stay. It's a neat mix of Indian foods and sort of western breakfast foods, but everything has a bit of a twist. Overall, though, it's good and we really fill up to start our day. My one complaint is that the coffee certainly leaves something to be desired... ah well.

Our next challenge was to get Anjali from the airport. She was arriving at 12:30 in the afternoon on a domestic flight from Dehli where she has been staying with family for the last two weeks. That turned out to be a bit of a challenge. Sagar had arranged for another car to pick Vanessa and I up from the hotel to go to the airport to grab Anj and bring her back. The problem was, I felt the timeline was pretty tight because the airport is at LEAST 45 minutes away, more with traffic, and the car was supposed to get us at noon, get Anj, come back to the hotel, then we were supposed to go meet Kamini across town for lunch before massage appointments at 3pm. If you are confused, you are still not experiencing the level of chaos that was experienced that afternoon. Basically, Anj had arrived at the airport and still no car had shown up at the hotel to get me and Vanessa. We would discover this would soon be a reoccuring theme. The other issue was that without an Indian mobile (cell phone) we have a terrible time communicating with anyone. So when the car didn't come we had to get the hotel to call Sagar's mobile, which they were hesitant to do for us (only some of the hotel staff are helpful. We have now figured out which ones are the enablers and which ones are to be avoided) to figure out what to do. Much texting was going on through a web-based text service because Anjali had wifi at the Bangalore airport, but we were paying for wifi by the hour at our hotel. So we would text Anjali and attempt to call Sagar multiple times, and it was all very confusing. Eventually Anjali just worked up the courage to take a taxi by herself to the hotel. It worked out find. Oh, meanwhile we were doing the same web-based texting to Kamini, who was wondering what the heck was going on. Kamini's aunt and uncle live in Bangalore so she has been here many times. In fact, her parents were visiting right now, as well.

So, basically, Anjali arrived, ditched her stuff in Vanessa's room, and then we attempted to get to the restaurant where we were supposed to meet Kamini and the other boys (they had headed out on their own for some exploring earlier). We asked the hotel to call us a taxi, and when a car arrived we got it. As we were pulling away we tried to confirm the rate but the driver started quoting crazy prices. He wanted us to pay to hire him for 4 hours, but we only wanted a one-way trip. There was much frustration and fighting and Anjali arguing in broken Hindi (she lived in India from ages 3-5) which eventually culminated in us asking to be brought back to hotel. So, that was transportation fail number 2 for the day. It turns out that was a bit of a miscommunication and now we know the difference between a metered taxi and hiring a driver. The hotel clearly has a vested interest in hiring cars because they constantly push us to get them, even though we don't need or want that. Finally we got a metered cab (again, after craziness but I won't get in to it) and headed off. We texted the driver's mobile number to Kamini before we left the wifi zone of the hotel, and she had someone call him to give directions. It took convicing to get the driver to pick up the phone because he didn't understand what was going on, but eventually he did. Miraculously, we ended up in front of the restaurant, I and Monkey, for a very reasonable 200 rupees. Phew!

By this time, we were really late. It was almost 3:00 and the restaurant was closing at that time, plus we were supposed to be at the spa then. Luckily the boys had only just arrived, themselves, because their rickshaws had no idea where to go. It turns out that Kamini's whole extended family was there and that her uncle knows the owner, so they were lenient and stayed open a bit later for us. The food and service were fantastic! A cold beer was nice after the stress of the day, as well. As an added bonus, when we got up to leave we found out that Kamini's family had taken care of the bill for us - so kind! Even better, they had left us two cars and drivers to get where we needed to go. The boys went shopping while us girls went off to a little local salon that Kamini knows well.

I would never in a million years have known about that place myself because it really was just a business out of someone's house on a small side street, but the ladies there cared about their work and paid a lot of attention to detail for a very reasonable price. I had my first mani/pedi, which was... interesting. The manicure was nice, but I'm really not that into people getting that invested in my feet, I think. I may not get another opportunity to have a manicrue, however, because soon I'll be starting surgical training and you can't have nailpolish on when you scrub in to surgery. Flakes of laquer are not good things to get in a surgical field! I had been hoping for a massage, as well, but I didn't really have time in the end because the other girls were finished up their treatments and I didn't want to hold up the group.

From there we swung by an Indian clothing shop because I wanted to get an Indian outfit for the engagment party that night. Sagar's family had purchased all of us beautiful Indian clothing for the wedding, but I kind of wanted to wear something different for the engagement (Anjali had a bunch of outfits to choose from and Vanessa was borrowing something from Kamini, but I'm about twice the size of them so I was on my own). Kamini said the shop we were going to had really well priced stuff so it would be a quick win. Well, it turns out times had changed since the last time she was there! I went to try on a long shirt and pants which was * nice * but not a dream garmet of mine or anything, and took a look at the pricetag in the changeroom. It said 7000 rupees. I stood there for a while thinking that jet lag or something must be prohibiting my conversion skills. How could this cotton shirt cost 7000 rupees? I must be missing a decimal or something. I came out with the outfit on and asked Kamini how much 7000 rupees was. She was like, ""I don't know... $150 or something. Why?"" ""Because that's how much this costs!!!"" ""WHAT??!?!"" She exclaimined. ""OK, well just take it off and let's get out of here! That's crazy!""

Anjali was shocked, too. She said we could by the same thing for $30 in Toronto. We're not talking silk sari or anything... this was just a cotton long shirt and pants with some embroidary embellisment. We are told that times have changed in the last few years. As Bangalore, and, presumably, India in general, has boomed the divide between upper-middle class and poor has increasingly widened. There has been an increased emphasis on material goods and prices have risen accordingly. Basic silk saris cost hundreds of dollars now.

I decided to wear a western dress from home to the engagment party.

Before heading to the hotel and the party, we swung by Kamini's aunt's house so that she and Vanessa could get dressed in their saris and we could have some tea. They looked gorgeous, but my goodness they were a production to put on! It starts with a small crop top (the blouse) and a long skirt which ties up (the petticoat). These are basically foundation garments. Then a single gigantic piece of cloth is tucked in to the top of the petticoat and wrapped around the wearer multiple times. Finally, it is brought up and around the shoulder, pleated, and pinned up. That probably sounds more simple than it actually is. Kamini's mom had to help and at times there were two people involved in the pleating and pinning. Apparantly they are very hot and heavy, as well.

Finally, we headed back to the hotel so Anjali and I could get dressed. Here, the clothing ordeals continued. I slipped in to my dress no problem, but Anjali had a wardrobe malfunction. She was wearing a long Indian dress/shirt (I should really know the names for these things) which had one of those small zippers running down the side which always gets caught. It continually got stuck and we could NOT get it to go down. The worst part was that it was sticking near the top, so basically one whole side of her outfit was gapping open. Poor Anj was determined to wear that dress, though, because it had long sleeves and here arms were COVERED in terrible mosquito bites from Dehli, some of which had actually blistered! So, we tried and tried to get that zipper down, unsure of what we were missing downstairs because events were already supposed to have started at this point. With Anjali's arm raised over her head, Vanessa, Kamini, and I all worked away, pulling at various parts of armpit fabric and zipper, trying to close the seam. It was actually rather hilarious. Eventually brute force prevailed and the zipper went down, but the upper part split open. Oh well. 80% was closed. Now, though, we needed a pin to secure that part to make sure no other part of the zipper seam pulled open. Kamini and Vanessa had safety pins on their saris, but they were serving important functions and they couldn't be given up. No one else had any pins of any kind. After a search my bag and hotel room, I managed to find one straight pin and a small ""BEAVERS CANADA"" pin with a safety pin style back. Anj was desperate at this point, so the BEAVERS CANADA pin was employed. If someone looked closely, they would have been rather confused with the latest accessories from Canada.

Finally, we were ready to head down to the engagement party and meet up with the boys. I guess I haven't said much about it yet, but this is an arranged marriage that Sagar is entering in to. He met his wife-to-be for the first time in December when he went home to India for a week. They were then going to get engaged through an elaborate ceremony this night and be married the next day. Short, so no time to back out, I guess!

It turns out we hadn't missed much. Apparently Indian wedding ceremonies are fairly fluid events where people kind of come and go throughout. This ceremony was in very full, hot room. There was a traditional band playing in the corner and Sagar and Deepa were on a beautiful stage with flowers all around. There were also big time bright lights with two video cameras and two still photographers - one set for each side of the family. The evening consisted of a lot of blessings and a LOT of photographers. Everyone was dressed beautifully in outfits shimmering with every colour of the rainbow. Sagar's family is extremely nice and made us always feel welcome and taken care of. His sister and her husband are especially great. They had recently done fellowships at McGill so they have a good handle of what our ""norms"" are and take care of us when we look confused. They are both doctors, as is Sagar's father. In fact, there are 17 doctors in their family! We know we have nothing to worry about while we are here. Many guests wanted to speak with us and find out what brought us all the way here from Canada, and they, in turn, explained parts of the ceremony to us.

After eating a delicious Indian buffet dinner we got a chance to give our blessings to the engaged couple. This involved us going barefoot up on the stage and waving a platter with lighted candles and fresh flowers around in a circle. Then we touched the rim of the candle holders with our finger and then touched the finger to the forehead of each Sagar and Deepa.

Eventually we snuck off to our rooms as things were winding down. The boys had attempted to acquire some booze earlier in the day for us. They did well on the beer (""Kingfisher"" beef is ubiquitous here) but we had requested wine, and that was more difficult. When they told their driver they needed wine they were taken down an alley and dropped off in front of an enclosed cage with a small window. They asked for wine and a jug of ""local"" wine was produced. It was kind of sketchy, and fortified. They boys bought three jugs. Haha. So, that night we tried the wine. It was.... terrible. How were we going to drink 3 litres of this stuff! We tried mixing it with some soda water and that made it slightly more bareable. Eventually we discovered it was more tolerable if we stopped thinking of it as wine and more as just miscellanous alcohol. I still wasn't a huge fan, but tonight (2 nights later) the last jug was finished off. I never thought we would do it.

The next day was the wedding in the morning, followed by a reception in the evening. I hope I get to write about it all but time is marching on! I should get a chance for some more writing tomorrow morning because we will probably have a bunch of time waiting for a car to pick us up (we are going up north to Deepa's village for a continuation of the marraige ritual stuff). I should probably stop here for tonight because it's almost 2am and we have a big day tomorrow. I have TONS of pictures. I'll try to get those up tomorrow, too. Goodnight for now!

After having a wonderful first half clicking around at The Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, I returned to my hotel room in Mysore. I still had the rest of the day to explore some more places in and around Mysore. I recalled, some years ago when I was living in Bangalore, I had a friend from Tibet, Kalsang. Once he mentioned about Bylakuppe, one of the largest Tibetan settlement in India and the beautiful monasteries around. My brain clicked and I checked with the Hotel reception immediately.



‘How far is Kushalnagar?’, I asked.



‘Almost 2 hours’ drive from here’, hotel manager replied.



‘Thank you’, I disconnected the intercom.



Within 10 minutes I had my camera ready and I walked down to the City bus stand in Mysore. I love Karnataka not only for its beautiful destinations but also ‘The
Photo 10
Best’ transport connectivity in India. I was asking around about the buses to Kushalnagar. One guy pointed out to platform no. 3. I gradually walked to the platform no. 3 and I saw almost 5 buses were ready to start immediately. To go to Kushalnagar, one has to take a bus to Madikeri.



‘Kushalnagar?’ I asked.



‘Hop in’, conductor nodded.



In next 10 minutes I was enjoying the beautiful and clean city streets of Mysore. And in next 20 minutes I was cruising through Bangalore-Madikeri Road. The first big stop was at Hunsuru, a big sub divisional town in Karnataka. The turf between Mysore to Hunsuru was just a paradise to all the cruisers and my



KSRTC 'Bus man' did live up to my expectation. The bus halted here for about 5 minutes and hit the road again. The road between Hunsuru to Kushalnagar took almost an hour and half and was so scenic that I was enjoying every bit of it. I was travelling with a Monk and his granddaughter. He was telling me the stories of Bylakuppe and the monasteries. The bus was roaring at the
Photo 2
top gears and climate was cozy enough to enjoy every moment of it. I was thinking about my next line of plans. This extension of Coorg is really eye pleasing. Lush green terrains, long winding roads, Aromas like fresh morning glory and drive



Amidst coffee and pepper plantations which was aplenty. Around 4pm the bus dropped me at Kushalnagar bus stand. This place seemed to me like any other district town in Karnataka with all sort of modern amenities available. I was gazing around in search of a vehicle to drive me to Bylakuppe which was merely 2 and half miles away from Kushalnagar. I walked out of the bus stand and found a fellow in mid-forties waiting with his three wheelers.



'Bylakuppe?', I asked



'Golden Temple?', He asked further



'Yes sir',I replied



'30 rupees sir', he said



'Let’s go’, I hoped in.



Upon asking his name, he said, ‘Ayub'. He took a diversion from the freeway and was asking about my whereabouts and reason for visiting this place. I got his 'between the lines' that he was trying
Photo 12
to clinch a deal. I got the point and asked him straight.



'How many temples are here apart from the Golden Temple?'



'Sir, there are 4 more', he replied.



'And how much you are going to squeeze out of my pocket if I would make a visit to all four of them’, I offered him a deal.



'Sir, there is a long trip for 4 monasteries that would cost around Rs.400 and there is a short trip of 4 monasteries which would be lesser, Rs.250',He got me thinking.



I couldn't understand his offer. If there are four monasteries how come there are 'long and short' trips. Is he planning to rip me? I sank deep in my thoughts. He realized his answer was a kind of a riddle to me which I was playing a hard ball to decode. He went further describing the details.



'Sir, apart from The Golden Temple, there are four more monasteries. Sera Je, Sera Mey, Kagyu and a newly built one. If you would like to visit all four except Kagyu which eventually isolated from the others,
Photo 13
would cost you Rs.250. Makes sense?'



I got his point, but to let others understand him in a better way, there are 5 monasteries in this Bylakuppe-Kushal Nagar Sector. Namdroling (Which is known as the Golden Temple to the locals), Sera Jey, Sera Mey, Kagyu and a newly constructed one which neither him nor I was sure about the name. I was thinking what to do as it was almost 4:30pm and I eventually picked up an overcast day which would mean that the sunlight won't be available much longer to make good shots. I asked him to drop Kagyu this time and clinched the 'short deal' with Rs. 250/-. He seemed to be happy enough with that too.



Drive from Kushalnagar to Bylakuppe was through narrow city lanes and didn't take more than 20 minutes to reach The Golden Temple. Unlike my other tours, I found a bit of a crowd here as being a public holiday, people from faraway places decided to take a short diversion to this place enroute Madikeri, Coorg. Other than that I didn't feel anyone has any sort interest in Monasteries or how the monks lead their lives
Photo 5
here. A typical South Indian crowd who really got messed up this place with any other Hindu Temple and was trying a make a fuss here.I love visiting monasteries mostly for the peaceful environment and tidiness which really a 'big miss' in any other Hindu Temple. I walked inside and found a 'Big Hostel' kind of building to me left, indeed that was the place where the monks live. I walked further ahead and found that entire campus was huge and maintained with utmost creativity and serenity. I moved ahead to the main temple after clicking a few more shots. The main Buddha Idol was almost 80 feet tall and was crafted with a lot of colorful impressions. In front of the idol a natural sphere was tried to project and it was done with utmost neutrality that I could see a few birds were enjoying this wonderful place as well. As usual the 'messed up' tourists were trying to create a mess with packs of 'Frito Lays' and 'Gooddays'. I was really getting my 'apples hot' so decided to walk out of this place immediately. I was feeling pity for the monks that their purpose of practicing meditation really
Photo 14
went for the day for these ‘immature’ tourists out there. I tried to pose a few shots with monks and they seemed to very humble people with a smile on their face always. Time was running out for me and I had 3 more to visit. Ayub was waiting for me and he clutched his ""Merc"" faster to Sera Je. Once we drove out of The Golden Temple, I found that the bunch of tourists were not following this route which gave me a slight indication that their ""diversion"" was just for the Golden Temple not for the other monasteries here. From Namdorling to Sera Je may be a mile's drive and yes ! I was the only person to enjoy the serenity. I interacted with a few more monks and tried to learn about their routines and how they feel staying furthest from home. I really liked their answers and yes, with a smile always. After spending sometime in Sera Je and Sera Mei I saw a small Tibetan Restaurant just outside the Sera Mei monastery. I realized that I didn't have a bite of grains to eat since morning. I was more curious to have 'Momo','Fing Sha' and
Photo 15
'Tingmo' after some years. I asked Ayub whether these monks allow other tourists to stay in their hostels then I could give it a try for a night. He said that they usually don't but if I say I was just alone and would like to do some research, they might allow. I got his trick again. I spoke with one of the main administrators of the Sera Mei monastery and almost begged with utmost innocence to spend one night at the hostel. Since I was born I realized that my innocent face was the key to my success. My job, my marriage everything went hassle-free because of my innocence and here I was a 'no exceptional' as well. I asked Ayub bhai to return to Kushal Nagar and to pick me up at the early am next day. Rest of the evening I spent time roaming around the places and sharing my travelling experiences with the monks. Since being requested by the administrator, I am not sharing the routines and the other 'High profile but sensitive' discussions about Tibet and the Tibetans.



I had a wonderful dinner with the monks and it was Momos,Tingmo and Shapta.
Photo 16
I was feeling like being in heaven. One thing for sure, I need to visit this



Place quite often. It's not a 'one time' place to come, see and leave but a place which would give strength to your lungs to breath afresh. I am in love with this place. However, unwillingly I woke up with Ayub bhai's honk, next day around 7am. After expressing my sincere thanks and gratitude to the monks whom I



Befriended with during my stay in Bylakuppe for just more than 16 hours. I am sure that the bunch of tourists seeking their 'Vacation' will not visit this place as it has nothing but the 'music of traquility,peace and harmony' which I may have longed for years. Love you Bylakuppe. God bless all !!!

February 15th 2014

Goofy Romeo
Greetings to you, today is a cold gloomy day in Kathmandu, so I’m gladly wrapped up in a blanket on the couch drinking tea out of a huge mug. Just finished reading Jon Krakauer’s book on fundamental Mormonism, so that was uplifting.



Anyways, lets forget polygamy and revelations from God and talk about camels!



So Pushkar is a two-hour train ride southeast of Jaipur, and is a small lakeside town on the edge of a deserty kind of terrain (this loose definition is important later, stay tuned). Pushkar has a ton of temples, and is home to one of the world’s only Brahmin temples. To get to Pushkar, you take the train to Ajmer, a town which makes you run for the hills, literally, by getting on a local bus (upon which we again got a 30% ladies discount J), and riding it for 30 minutes over the Snake Ridge hills. When you get to Pushkar it seems like a maze of narrow alleyways, and it’s really easy to get yourself turned around. Which happened a few times, if you can imagine.



We got to the Hotel Everest, oddly named since Pushkar
Oh Romeo, so godlike
is nothing like Everest, and I immediately cooed over a gorgeous black lab named Lion, who seemed to be simultaneously adored and despised by his owner. I only adored him. The hotel had a great rooftop terrace and restaurant, so we immediately plunked ourselves up there and chilled out. There isn’t a ton to do in Pushkar, chilling being the main activity, so we gladly decided to take part in that. And went ate food, and shopped, obviously.



The next morning we woke up, chilled some more, and then headed towards the Saraswati Temple, which isn’t that renowned as a temple itself (though Saraswati, who is the Goddess of Learning, Wisdom, and Speech, and she could also be a bit of a bitch, is my personal favorite). What is renowned is that you have to climb a hill for half hour to get to the temple and when you get up there you get great views of the town and surrounding hills and landscape. What the Lonely Planet doesn’t mention is that there are massive black-faced monkeys (which Google tells me are Grey Langurs) lining the path up the hill. Shocking. We scooted up the path a
Romeo’s view
bit faster than 30 minutes due to the monkeys, lets be honest. Up at the top the view was excellent, and despite having the door of the Saraswati Temple slammed in our faces the minute we arrived, seemingly the temple closes at 11:57am, we hung around up top and enjoyed the view. And the heat that was noticeably increasing every minute. Walking down the hill, there was a marked decrease in monkey population, so they were either off keeping cool in the shade, or more likely feasting on the flesh of a hapless tourist.

......

Asia » India » Karnataka » Hampi
April 23rd 2012
Published: April 23rd 2012


Mid river swimming, Dandeli
NORTH KARNATAKA

Mumbai – Dandeli – Sirsi – Yana-Hampi – Pattadakal – Badami – Aihole – Bijapur – Mumbai 20th – 25th March’2012

We left Mumbai by Mangalore Expresses at 10.15 pm scheduled to reach Karwar next day 8.30 am. The idea was to start our North Karnataka tour from Karwar with plans to enjoy about 2-3 hours of para-gliding and other beach activities at Deobagh Resort, Karwar in the morning before proceeding further. However the train reached about 2 hours late forcing us to drop the idea and head straight for Dandeli by road.

Lesson 1 learnt :- Kokan Railway operates on only one track and thus invariably trains run late, so keep enough time margin on hand.

For going to Dandeli from Mumbai, better is to embark at Londa Station which is just about 38 kms from Dandeli. Your Dandeli hotel would invariably arrange for a pickup at a small cost or local taxis are available just outside both Londa or Karwar station for Dandeli.
Day 1



Karwar – Dandeli is about 112 kms but took us more than 4 ½ hours as about 25 kms of road in between is extremely
Crocodiles in Dandeli river
bad, almost non-existent! Even though this is supposed to be a state highway, apparently the forest department is holding back permission for rebuilding of road due to ecological reasons as it passes through forest. But hello- somebody enlighten me, what is bad for ecology and pollution and noise creation and vehicle maintenance? Number of vehicles traveling remaining same (as everybody is forced to take this road, it being a state highway actually), vehicles traveling smoothly in 4th gear or vehicles forced to travel in 1st / 2nd gear for over a distance of 25 kms!

Our booking was at Kali Adventure camp run by Jungle Lodge & Resorts and was for riverside facing tents.

Tip :- When booking, ask for tent number 3,4, 5 as they offer best river view.

The booking is on per person basis, two sharing a tent which actually is a kind of permanent structure with attached bathroom. Gives you fairly an adventurous atmosphere without sacrificing the comforts we city people are accustomed to!

The booking includes all food (breakfast, lunch, dinner) , 2 hours jungle safari (choice between morning 5.30 am and evening 4 pm safaris), coracle (round traditional boat) ride
River Rafting, Dandeli
in river. The food is on buffet basis and quality is Ok. The evening fish curry made from freshly caught Katla fish from the river was excellent with high local spicy tang.

People mainly go to Dandeli for river rafting. A 9 km rafting is provided in the river Kali and the rapids are not very “rapids” means everybody can do it. Apparently they are not even as strong as Kolad near Mumbai (though Dandeli is definitely more scenic), forget the north Indian Himalayan river rapids.

Tip – As the river water flow is controlled by hydroelectric Dam nearby, best season to enjoy would be just after monsoons when river would be naturally gushing through. At other times, specially summer times, you are at the mercy of the dam (no pun intended) people. So the moment you land at your Dandeli hotel, first check for Water flow and immediately book, don’t wait for next day. Who knows next day no water might be released from the dam to the river and thus no river rafting!

Luckily the day we reached, there was a good water flow and thus we had a quick lunch and headed straight for
River Rafting, Dandeli
rafting. The total time involved is about 3 and half hours as the rafting starts from a place called Ganeshguddi, about 20 odd kms away inside forest. Rafting charges are not included in the hotel package and currently the rate is Rs 1300 per person. The hotel arranges for the tour including pick up and drop in a jeep to the rafting point.

The rafting experience begins first with a lecture on safety precautions to be taken in case of emergency (yes, accidents do happen, in front of us about 4 passengers fell off another boat in the 9th rapid, nobody was hurt). One is provided with a helmet and life jacket (so knowing swimming is not a requirement for rafting!). Jeans, heavy clothing are not allowed as when wet, they tend to drag you down if you fall in water. Best is half pants and Tshirt.

The boat navigator is an experienced person (ours was an imported one all the way from Nepal) and guides you well. About 8 – 10 people are in a boat and first thing after reaching mid river is an order to jump into the river! This is mainly to drive away
Dandeli Forest Drive
fear of water from those who don’t know swimming. Your life jacket allows you to stay afloat, so go ahead without fear and jump. Also another staff is always there in a kayak alongside ready to help anybody requiring help.

Swimming in a flowing mid river is definitely a high adrenalin stuff. More so when the your guide quietly informs everyone that there are crocodiles in the river! No joke, we actually saw two , quietly basking on one of the river small islands. Apparently the crocodiles are satisfied with whatever fish they get in the river to bother any human beings sloshing around in the water. No human has ever been bitten / eaten by any crocodile in this river as per the locals.

So after some swimming around in the river, you are pulled back in the boat by the guide (pulling back in the boat is an art by itself, try pulling a guy weighing upwards of 80 kgs, straight out of water in a boat) and now its showtime, the rafting is about to begin.

First the guide asks all the rowers to pool together their paddles and do a high five with
Coracle ride, Dandeli
them and asks them to shout out “Jack Ali”! Faithfully everybody shouts out Jack Ali. Jack Ali? Did I hear it right, was it some kind of national integration programme involving people from different religions? I couldn’t resist and asked him again to speak it out slowly and now he says “Jai Kali”, the river is kali river and by saying it you are paying your respects to the river to protect you. So from where this Jack Ali thing has come? Well, it is just pronounced that way for the benefit of the foreigners!

There are total of 9 rapids in the stretch , the first and last are best, the in betweens are rather tame once you have experienced the very first one. There is an “onboard” professional photographer who frequently gets down on river islands to take your snaps in action. Charges Rs 500 for it, worth it, go for it as you yourself are in no position to take your own photos while rafting.

Its late evening by the time you come back to the resort but a nice surprise awaits you there, campfire accompanied by unlimited hot pakoras and chicken tandoori barbqued right
Sahasralinga river bed
in front of you (part of the package, no extra charge, tho that does spoil your dinner lit bit later on) . Bring your own bottles if you want to enjoy more (offitially not allowed but everybody had brought one and kept hidden in paper bags!). There is a reasonably priced bar but it offers very limited range, even Bacardi was not available.

Day 2

Woken up by staff at 5 for morning for jungle safari drive.

Tip :- If river water flow is not constraint, do rafting in morning and jungle safari in afternoon as morning jungle safari was too foggy when we went. Jungle being absolutely thick, you could hardly see deep inside or get the apparently excellent view of mountain valley side.

Morning air was quite chilly and cold even though it was start of summer, so if you are going in monsoons or winter, be prepared with heavy woolens.

There are apparently about 50 odd black leapords in Dandeli apart from tigers, but as always you need all the luck on your side to spot any of them. We had to be content only with their foot prints but we did
Yana Rock formations
see bison, jackal, deers, snakes and variety of exotic jungle birds.

Back from safari, had a nice breakfast and headed for river in front for a Coracle ride. Coracle, a round traditional boat made from bamboo is supposed to be so sturdy that it can carry 8 people and in villages it is used to carry even motorcycles across .

The boatman takes you around for about half hour ride to a nearby river island where crocodiles come for basking. If you are brave enough, he will help you to actually get down on the island for a photo opportunity (we did).

We had booked only for one day , it was time for us to check out . It might be a good idea to actually stay for two days, one day for pure relaxation. However two things, the resort is not in deep jungle as one expects it to be and second it is bit overpriced for the kind of facility and food offered (Rs 2,950 per person per day for tent accomodation). However the staff is very friendly and helpful. The counter got us extremely reasonable priced excellent taxi for further 5 days trip.

Tip : You can get very cheap rates at Kulgi forest camp (Rs 400 per night) but it is actually nowhere deep in the forest, so unless you have your own vehicle, it may not be right choice plus apparently it requires advance reservation from Forest department which till last moment we couldn’t get (or didn’t know how to get all the way from Mumbai). Also not sure whether rafting and jungle safari can be organized from there, your own vehicles are not allowed inside the jungle.

Checked out around 11 as we had a long planned road journey. The plan was to go to Sirsi, Yana and stay for the night at Jog Falls. Got a good rate from the resort for a Ford Toofan ( a 10 seater) , very spacious and comfortable vehicle, the guy charged us only Rs 7.50 per km, not aircoditioned, (minimum 300 kms a day) plus Rs 100 per night driver allowance, a steal for us when compared with rates for other vehicles. We booked it for next 5 days.

Headed straight for Sirsi, about 80 odd kms from Dandeli. About 15 kms before Sirsi is Sahstralinga. As the name
Entrance to Yana cave
suggests, there are hundreds of big and small shiv lingas carved on boulders in a river bed.

The story goes that few hundred years back, local king Nayakan 1 did not have son, heir to his throne. The court astrologer told him to do shiva puja by constructing 1001 shiv lingas. Hence the river bed is filled with them (sahsra is thousand), though now the big ones have got broken off over the years maybe due to flowing debris in flooded river during monsoon. So if you want to see them, monsoon may not be a good time as they would be submerged in high river water level. Be prepared to wade through the river to see them and huge carved bulls alongside.

It is not known whether all this construction of shiv lingas cured the problem in the king’s linga and he getting his much desired heir. But definitely worth a visit . Right side of the car park, a path goes to a hanging bridge from which you can watch the river flow by below.

From there, we proceeded to Yana, another 60 odd kms.

Tip :-Road to Yana goes through absolutely thick impenetrable
600 steps climb up Angini Mountain
jungle, most of it totally isolate except for one or two villages in between. So plan yourself such a way that you must reach there latest by 3 pm so that you can head out back to civilization by 5 - 6 pm, i.e. before sun goes down.

Yana is nature’s wonder. Huge towering rock structures, apparently carved due to impact of flowing rainwater over them over millions of years. From car parking, you have to walk down for about a km and half in a forest path and suddenly it opens in front of you.

There is a 800 year old shiva temple inside a cave below one of the rock structure. The cave has running water from a stream bringing water deep inside from mountain. Apparently regardless of whether it is summer or heavy monsoon, the water flow remains constant and volume doesn’t ever change.

Around the temple, you can go round through a natural opening in the rock structure. For climbing up , proper staircase have been made but for coming down, its still rough path, So not advisable for elderly people. But for others, definitely worth a visit. Religious people go around taking
Angini mountain top, Hampi
it as a pradikshna (going around) the temple. You are not allowed to wear footwear so be ready to get some painful jabs from stones. But don’t miss it for such flimsy reasons. As I said, it’s a nature wonder. Going up and back down again takes about 20 odd minutes for young fast people though we took almost an hour enjoying the rock structure inside.

Back to civilization but at Sirsi we were informed that going to Jog falls (highest waterfall of India?) would be futile as the water flow is controlled by dam on top and as per the local person, at this time of the year (March) and till monsoon, a cow pees more water than the water flowing in the falls. So we decided to drop Jog falls and head for Hubli for the night stay.

This meant long drive of about 125 kms and we reached Hubli at about 9 pm, dead tired. Nothing to see or do in Hubli, only a night halt against our earlier planned night halt at Jog water falls.
Day 3


Started from Hubli and went to Hampi (110 kms), the glorius capital of Vijaynagara empire, now
Sunset atop Angini Mountain, Hampi
a World Heritage site.

Hampi is in two parts with Tungabhadra river flowing through in between. Modernisation has taken its toll and now the nostalgic coracle boat ride across is replaced by motor boat. While all the main ruins are on the side of Hampi village, the other side, actually an island in the river, offers wonderful staying facilities.

We decided to go across and stay at the island, planned it as a rest day.

Tip : The boat to Hampi island stops at 6 pm and there is nothing available for crossing the river after that, so be planned and careful. There is alternative road 35 kms long to reach the island from Hampi village while the boat crossing hardly takes 10 minutes, so makes sense to park your vehicle on this side and take the boat across if you want to stay on the island or visit the sites on other side. The other side had lines of back packer resorts one after another, all targeted at firang backpacker crowd. We enquired at few places and finally settled at Mowgli Resort. What a good decision that turned out to be. It offers river facing hut
Queen's Summer Palace Hampi
styled rooms , neat and clean, food was great. There are khatiyas (wood and coir beds) and swings in front of each hut and you could just laze through on them whole day. Even the dining area offers a separate floor sitting area under the trees and lined with cushions where you can have old Indian style floor sitting lunch / dinner. And all this is very reasonable priced (Rs 600 for a river facing hut having a double bed and attached bathroom), the room rates were much lower than next door resorts offering same kind of stuff. Though apparently season time (Oct – Feb) rates go upto Rs 2000 per hut.

Tip – Hampi off season is from April – August, actually some of the hotels close down during these months simply because the temperature crosses 45* C and since all the sites are in open, you would be spending whole day out in blazing sun.

Best is to go at March end or Aug-Sept , i.e just before or just after offseason so that you get best of the rates, atmosphere has improved and avoid the season crowd.

Late afternoon we tied up with a
Housing for Royal elephants
rickshaw to go around the island side. The standard rickshaw charges for a 3 hour ride around is Rs 350 – 400 and for a Tata Magic Rs 650 .

Tip – Don’t bother to take this ride, compared to what is offered on main Hampi side , this side has hardly anything worth seeing except for two things, both of which you can actually walk through if you love long walks.

The first thing is for the religious minded, Pampa sarovar, this lake finds its mention in old hindu mythology. Apparently this was where Ram came during his long 14 year old vanvas and met Shabri (the one who offered berries to him). His footprints are still there in the temple there. The name Pampa later became Hampa and then Hampi, the modern name of the place. The lake is full of brilliant white lotus flowers.

The second thing is for both religious as well as normal tourist, Angini mountain. For normal tourist , climb up this mountain is must as top offers a fantastic view of entire Hampi. Absolute must for everyone to watch sunset from there. On top , there is kind of flat
Arches in Queen's palace
top and you can sit on any of the big boulders to watch the sunset. Any day, there would be scores of people up there for it (mainly whites, don’t know why there was no Indian except us). There are about 600 odd steps (properly made) to climb up, takes about 30 - 45 minutes to climb up.

Now for the religious people and the answer to why 600 odd proper steps have been made to reach top. On top is a Hanuman temple, its birth place of Hanuman! This is where his mother Angini met his father Vayu. And from there the name, Angini Parbat.

After watching the sunset and visit to the temple, climb down and back to the resort for a well deserved round of drinks and wonderful dinner, unfortunately the resort has only a beer license!
Day 4


Cross over to main Hampi by boat and have a guide for full day. If you really want to see and understand Hampi, a full day guide is must. Depending on who they think you are, the asking rates differ between Rs 800 and 2000. One fellow asked for Rs 1500 and refused to bargain
Narsimha statue , Hampi
even at the cost of loosing us! Finally we found another (good one ) for Rs 800 (go to tourist information office for it, just opposite main car park).

Hampi was definitely one of the golden days of India, after Chandragupta and Ashoka empires. To see it fully, atleast 2 to 3 days are required but we settled for one and half days. The ruins tell the stories of how rich , culturally / artistically / financially India was in those days.

Vijayanagara empire lasted about 200 odd years from 1450 to 1650 AD and Hampi got built over this time, massive temples, palaces, markets. They had gold and precious stones market 700 meteres long in front of the main temple, the makets attracted business people from Iran, Greece, Arabia, Chinese , not forgetting the Europeans. Each of these nationalities have been carved in their exact details on the temple walls showing some business dealings (like horse buying etc)

Virupaksha temple is main temple, even during those days pin camera concept was there and you can see it inside the main temple where the inverted image of 20 storied high gopuram (temple tower) is seen on a
Ganesha, Hampi
wall, with zero degree correctly marked (point where image inverts). On the roof there are 3 D carvings of various mythological stories. These are painted with paint still retained.

The other main temple constructed was Vithala Temple, a huge complex about 12 kms away, you are taken inside by battery operated vehicle (to avoid pollution damage to sites) run by ladies only (all employed under Rural Employment generation Scheme of governement). This temple was constructed when Vithala Statue was brought over from Pandharpur (about 800 kms away) when Pandharpur was attacked by muslim rulers of Bijapur. Apparently after bringing over the statue, the king found success in whatever he did and as gratitude, built this massive complex. It has a stone chariot whose wheels still run, though now they have been glued to floor as people did nothing but keep revolving this!

Whole temple is built on Vaastu shastra concept and your guide (if he is good and knowing) will explain you those concept and once you see it , you understand why the Vaastu shastra principles are what they are.

The temple has both south Indian and north Indian temple styles signifying the vastness of empire
Stone Chariot ,Hampi Vithala Temple
of vijaynagara empire. It has even a sun temple style konarka , Orissa way.

Main attraction of this temple was sangeet mahal, a 57 pillared structure. Each of these pillar (about 2 storied high) was made from a single stone and carved in such a way, that a musican could actually use his hand to play a particular musical instrument on it. Means when he tapped his fingers on it a particular way, it would emit sound of that particular instrument like tamboora, tabla, pakhawaj etc. Apparently those days , no actually musical instrument was used in the temple, the whole music was generated by these pillars only. Its not allowed now to be shown at Sangeet mahal pillars (whatever remaining there are), but your guide will show (play) the music at a smaller adjoining hall with smaller pillars.

There are carvings which are kind 2 in 1 and 5 in 1 etc, means same carving when you see from different angle seem different. So two in one is like elephant from one angle and bull from other angle. The guide covers different parts of the carving one by one to show the different kind

The other
City Water Tank, Hampi
thing worth seeing in Hampi are ofcourse the 20 - 30 odd high feet two huge gansha statues (much damaged) and narsimha statue (sort of reassembled now), they are really huge and made from one single block, one wonders at the carvers imagination and skill to carve out these gigantic structures.with minutest details. One of the ganesha statues when looked from front is pot bellied ganesha, but from behind looks like a lady sitting with her back, the hair style, curve of waist unmistakable. The explanation apparently is that from back it is supposed to be goddes parvati having her son ganpati sitting on her lap in the front.

The other palace worth seeing is the queens palace which was the palace for queens when their husbands would go out for long drawn battles etc. It has a natural airconditioned palace where water used to get dropped at the top of the third floor and then flowed down all around bringing in the coolness inside. There is an elephant area outside capable of holding 11 royal elephants, one dome for each elephant and each dome has got a different architecture and design.

Unfortunately mid sixteenth century, the king
Pattadakal Temple comlex
fell in love with his court dancer and on her advice, appointed her brother to a high court position. The dancer and her brother were actually spies for muslim rulers of Bijapur and over next few months, collected all the vital military secrets of Hampi.

Based on this knowledge, Hampi was attacked by Bijapur around 1650 AD and over a period of six months, they systematically destroyed everything that was there. To blow up the sangeet mahal, they brought entire Gold market wood in front and piled up the wood in the center of the mahal and lighted it up. The extreme heat generated was the only way the stone structure could be broken. And now only few pillars remain, the main structure gone, all blown up.

Similarly all the other structures of Hampi were destroyed, palaces, 18 – 20 foot tall well carved stautes (Ganesha, Narsimha, Vithalla), all in name of religion as this was deemed against the requirement of muslim religion. About 67 temples were looted and destroyed. Total of 600,000 people were massacred during this period. Only about 30% of original Hampi remains now, but even this 30% shows how grand the city must have
Badami Caves
been before its destruction.

We saw a repetition of this recently when 2000 years old Banyam Buddha in Afganistan was blown up using canons by Taliban. So much hatred, so much destruction towards something which one feels is not as per his religious belief, what a loss of art and creativity. Certainly this is not what any religion really says.

After the destruction, Hampi lay forgotten for next 200 years till late 19th century when one of the British Geographer stumbled on the ruins. Seeing whatever was visible, he got so impressed that he got in touch with Royal Geographical Society , London and asked them to send their best photographer who came over all the way and photographed entire Hampi and sent the photos to London. Based on those photos, British governement declared it as a heritage site and so it is actually thanks to British that Hampi was revived again. The exploration still continues as much of Hampi apparently still is buried in sand. Apparently come monsoon, the villagers go treasure hunting as water flow invariably brings up some or other treasures buried.

Day 5

Afternoon left for Pattadakal, 110 odd kms away. Actually
Badami Cave no. 3
it’s a triangle , three tourist places within 20 odd kms of each other (Pattadakal, Badami and Aihole), Each of these have stone temple structures prior to Hampi days.

Badami was first when independent structures were yet to come and temples were carved out in mountains (5th Century AD). So it has 4 caves, one for Jain , one for shiva , one for Vishnu and one normal. The third cave is the main and biggest one and the carvings are absolutely brilliant, huge statues carved in the mountain side.

Pattadakal was next in line of construction when individual standing temples started getting built. Unfortunatley again, the muslim invasion destroyed most of temples and the stautes inside but a huge bull made of granite still survives showing the carving capability of the carvers during those days who had the capability to carve the hardest known stone to mankind.



Stayed at Badami just opposite bus stand.

Tip : The Karnataka tourism hotel is way out of the place and not worth staying. It seemed like a ghost hotel where everything was locked up. Good food availability in Badami seems to be a big problem. Even
Cave carving , Badami
ordinary sada dosa seemed to be a big problem there from taste point of view.

Day 6

Left for Bijapur (80 kms away), on the way took a halt at Kudala Sangama where two rivers merge and there is a shiva temple middle of the merged river bed! Now they have made a huge round tower (about 5 odd storied high) around the temple. You cross a bridge over the river bed to reach this tower and then climb down inside the tower to reach the temple, as normally there would be river water all around outside it. Wonder in old days, how this temple was built and how they reached it.

Bijapur, the marvel of Islamic architecture, Gol Gumbaj is the main attraction and is the largest free standing dome in the world (tho now the claim for the same is being made by Vipassana pagoda built in 2008 at Gorai , Mumbai) , built in 17th century, it is HUGE and one really has to appreciate the architect who designed it.. Must be more than 15 storied high.

It has got graves of the ruler with his wives and kids and very interestingly his
Durga Temple, Aihole
hindu court dancer aptly named “Rambha”. The dynasty destroyed Hampi and its temples as it was deemed unislamic, then how did the king enjoy hindu classical dance (music and dance are unislamic as per some interpretations) and also so loved the court dancer that she was buried with him? Also the muslim religion forbids building of huge remembrance structures over dead, but we see this rule being totally forgotten by most of our muslim rulers. (both Gol Gumbaj and Ibrahim Rosa at Bijapur are actually mausoleums)

Anyways, gol gumbaj speaks of how advanced the muslim technology was when it came to architecture. You climb up the top through a narrow staircase and reach whispering gallery. Here if you whisper in a wall at one end, the person exactly diagonally opposite with his ear to the wall, will clearly hear it though the distance in between is as big as a football field and is totally empty. Unfortunately the crowd instead of whispering , shouts and howls, thinking the echo is the wonder, not realizing that true wonder is the whisper. It was one of the guards who showed us actually how it works ( a small payment to him
Kudal Sangam Temple
Climbing down the river bed to reach the temple
for the service worked for us).

Bijapur also has Ibhraim Roja, the memorial built for yet another ruler and has his and his family graves, good Islamic carvings and a palace of arches.

There is also a 55 ton canon called Malik a Maidan (ruler of battlefield) on one of the hillocks. It was the largest and heaviest built at that time to defent bijapur and was actually given as part of dowry when the queen got married. British tried to take it to London (just like everything else they could of india’s golden history). Luckily it was so heavy that the crane which was specially brought to lift it up from its place broke and thus the operation had to be abandoned. And thus the canon now lies little bit below from its original place where it fell after the crane broke.

The canon’s roar was supposed to be so loud that there was a specially built underground pit next to it. It was filled with water and the canon firing staff had 12 seconds after lighting the ignition to jump in this pit and stay inside the water. This was to protect their eardrums from
Gol Gumbaj, Bijapur
splitting.

Unfortunately or fortunately the canon was never used in an actual war and rather than Malik a Maidan, it remained Malik e Akhbar (ruler on paper!)

From Bijapur, we went straight to Solapur (80 kms) to catch our night train to Mumbai. The highway is totally congested with truck traffic and takes good enough more than 3 hours against our expectation of 2 hours. So keep enough margin if you are traveling this stretch.

From Solapur , one gets Siddheswar Express starting at 10.45 pm and reaching Mumbai next day morning at 6.30 am

Last but not the least, if you are traveling North Karnataka during the Ugadi (New year, Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra) days (which was March 23 this year), better avoid the internal roads. This day and the next day (for 2 days) is actually celebrated as Rang (colour) panchami there and its exactly like Holi played in rest of country. Every few kilometers your vehicles will be stopped by rowdy gangs of boys carrying oil colour cans and unless you pay up (anything between Rs 10 to Rs 50 depending on crowd size and your bargaining capacity) you and your vehicle will
Ibrahim Roja, Bijapur
be painted by these oil paints which are very difficult to get rid of . And at some places, inspite of us paying , they still put colour on our poor driver and threw the colour on vehicle front glass and side body.

That brought end to our short tour of North Karnataka, a hectic but refreshing tour covering both natural as well as man-made wonders.

Well now Gokarna. It was an interesting place to get to and I met some great people! The overnight 'delux' sleeper bus was supposed to be a special treat really for the journey from hampi to Gokarna. Getting to Hampi on the hard plastic chair of the standard public bus for 10hrs had not been comfortable in any way so i thought it was an investment to get a nights sleep on the trip back to the coast...

What I had not counted on was the 'delux' bus being full of cockroaches! And the part where they dumped all the people not headed to Goa (to Gokarna) in the middle of nowhere by the road at 2am to wait for an uncomfortable minibus to come collect us. Of course of the said minibus, the driver was fast asleep at that hour and failed to turn up... After 2 hours of waiting and making a fuss with a local hotel owner who seemed to know the driver, the hotel owner drove to the minibus driver's house to wake him up. So we were on the road again. With a whole lot of new mozzy bites.

We got to Gokarna and then had the task of making it to the final destination: Om beach. Although it went against every mental calculation I made we actually managed to fit 6 women (and all their rucksacks and daysacks) onto 1 auto-rickshaw for the journey. Sure we were sitting on top of eachother and the girl sitting with the driver had to get out and push it to make it start going but eventually te tuk tuk moved! And it made it all the way (at about 5 miles an hour!). We got there about an hour before sunrise and we sat on Om beach watching it go up before finding a place to stay. Had an early morning swim too, was brilliant.

Then spent two whole days on Om beach, which is pretty deserted, just enjoying the company of the girls we met on the bus, playing cards, drinking beer and all-round chilling out. Was great.

On the second day we did have a bit of a scare. Swimming in the sea, me and a Brazilian woman I met, Carolina, were discussing our childhood fear of sharks after watching Jaws (ok for me this fear is still quite real!). We were the only people in the water and suddenly we notice we are being frantically waved back to shore by this policeman. PANIC set in- we both grabbed eachother expecting to see a shark fin circling us! Actually the truth was worse, when we (suprisingly shortly!) got to shore he told us we should get out of the water because there might be a tsunami! Apparently there had been some bad earthquakes in Indonesia and the whole coast was preparing for a possible tsunami. Crazy. We slept so so well after that...!

Modified tools for the drive
Cheri's driving ""gloves"" (thank you united 1st class for those free socks)
We set out for Hampi from Bangalore on Day 3, but had to split the journey into 2 days due to significant traffic in Bangalore (yes, much worse than in Bombay and Delhi) and some rickshaw trouble that we wanted to resolve before moving ahead.

Our hotel was in the ""outskirts"" of Bangalore, but we still took about 2 hours to get away from the city traffic. Once outside, we ran into some car issues that took away the rest of the day. Thankfully, we got a rickshaw mechanic that fixed up our ride to as good as new, and we covered the distance to Hampi on Day 4.

It was interesting to see the changing landscape through the drive, starting with closer to tropical in Bangalore, dry desert-like landscape as we passed through the heart of Karnataka, to the boulders in Hampi. We plan to drive around Hampi tomorrow to see some of the ruins, and then head to Hyderabad.

Well happy easter readers! Hope you all had a good time :-) here there was not a chocolate egg in sight, far too hot. Besides the indians in Hampi were celebrating an entirely different festival; one which involved thousands of people milling about, throwing bananas and coconut milk around, supposedly in the direction of one of the temples.

The last couple of days I have been wondering between the ruins of this once-great Hindu city, and taking in the wonders that this festival involved, sweets and coloured pigments everywhere, decorated cows and floating platforms on the water. Besides that I have been taking in the fantastic landscape that encases the ruined city; huge boldor-filled vistas over a beautiful river. It reminds me of the pictures of some of the places in America, maybe arizona or something. Very interesting landscape. Extremely hot though! First thing in the morn and late afternoon are the only times ok for being out walking in it. Got up at 5 this morning and did a hike out and up this (quite small) mountain to a temple at the top, and watched the sunrise from there. Beautiful. Really incredible.

The bad news is...think I have lost irrevicably a load of my photos!! Tried to get them all up on facebook the other week but didnt have time to upload them all. The ones that were NOT uploaded, as well as those that were, are now missing from the camera and so I presume they are lost somewhere on the computer I was using at the time. I'm not fussed about some of the photos but I will miss my Taj Mahal ones!! I might be able to get them back...If I manage to meet up with Natalie in Kerela! Oh well. will have to see how we go. Have met a British girl, Louisa, here in Hampi and we are moving on back towards the coast, to Karnataka together probably tomorrow night, probs re-update the blog there!

Road to Bangalore
Trucks loved to get really close
Today was our first full day on the road. We started at 7am and headed off to Bangalore. The morning part of the drive was filled with beautiful scenery surrounding a relatively flat road. While the afternoon drive retained the beautiful scenery, it also contained singificant mountain passes which while not be signifcant for a 4-wheeler, were stressfull for our veg-mobile and its drivers. There were times during the drive where we were not sure if our Rickshaw would be able to get over the passes, let alone reach Bangalore by end of day. However, we (and the rickshaw) prevailed and got into Bangalore early enough to visit a mechanic and pamper our wheels with a tune up for a job well done!

Deviramman Temple
'Dada,i'm on my way to the bus stand'

I woke up with this call from Gaurav,my cousin. On the Previous day, I checked in to a small Hotel in Bangalore and when called up Gaurav and asked him to accompany me for my dream tour to Malnad region, like an offer to play for Mancehester United, he said,'see you tomorrow at the bus stand'.

It was a busy monday morning, around 7am,me and Gaurav walked in to the 'Majestic' bus stand in Bangalore. Our first destination was Hassan, a district town,around 200kms away from Bangalore. Buses from Bangalore to Hassan ply in every 10-15 minutes and depending upon the comfort level and your pocket size, one can opt any. We took a KSRTC 'Volvo' which was about to start for Mangalore. When asked whether this bus would go to Hassan, The driver, with a big smile, said,'hop in'. I was pretty happy that not only Gaurav had joined me but we got a dream start as expected. Distance between Bangalore to Hassan is about 198kms. The condition of the road was just amazing except in a few places where patch work was going on. The KSRTC 'Airavat' hit the
View of Bababudangiri Hills from Deviramman Temple
road with all the gears pulled and we were enjoying every bit of the journey. Slowly we crossed the Bangalore city limit, and the bus took to switch from the busy city streets to National Highway no. 75. To cover 198 kms, 'Airavat' took 4 hours and around 11:30 am we reached Hassan. Hassan is a district town with all the mondern facilities available. The newly constructed 'City Bus Stand' was really a gem on the crown. I was really envying the tidyness of this 'City Bus stand' and was trying to compare the same with the 'bus stands' in any distrcit town in Bengal. Even Gaurav was so happy, he took a couple of snaps for his 'Facebook' album. Since we had breakfast on the way, we decided to continue till Chickmagalur which would be some 50kms from Hassan. We switched buses and hoped in to a standard KSRTC bus which was absolutely waiting just for us.

'Dada, look at this bus, so well maintained, not like our CSTC buses', Gaurav broke his silence after a long spell.

'Yes, the main reason are the passengers who travel', I replied.

'Wish we could have such good buses
Somewhere on the way
in our West Bengal',Gaurav said.

I did notice a small line of frustration on his face. Gaurav went on describing each and every minute details about this bus. I knew that he was a 'freak' about automobiles and he 'marked' his mark with dignity. Hassan to Chickmagalur was around 50kms and this bus took almost an hour and half to cover the distance. In between, the bus stopped in Belur which is also famous for it's heritage. I told Gaurav that we would be covering Belur on a seperate tour, not at this time. I noticed he didn't object my decision. One best thing about Gaurav is,it doesn't matter what I do, he supports and thinks it is the best.Around 1:30pm we reached Chikmagalur.Even in the first week of April,we found that Chickmagalur got a 'cozy' climate which was enjoyable indeed. We walked out from the small 'City bus stand' and went on searching for a hotel. After browsing a few, we found 'Hotel Soundarya Residency' fit within our budget and seemed a decent family hotel. After completing the check in formalities and the moment we entered 'room 205' the first reaction came from Gaurav,'Awwwwwhhhh'. It took a couple
Close up view of Bababudangiri Hills
of seconds for me to find out whether it was a frustration or a 'jump for joy'. Indeed, he saw it, a breathtaking view of the Malnad hills was visible from the room itself. It did pull up the 'adrenaline' rush and I was thinking what was holding for us for tomorrow's trip when we would climb up that hill. We decided to spend the evening hovering
around Chikmagalur and made a trip to Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary(which would be published as a seperate blog). I spoke with Mr.Yogi the car owner and cleared my intention about what we could expect the best out of the Malnad region. Finally we settled with Rs.1700/- for a day's tour which would cover almost all the possible places to explore.Mr.Yogi understood clearly that we were not there like 'any other tourists'.

Next day early at 6am one Indica honked in front of our hotel and we were ready to hit the road. When asked the name, the driver replied,'Ravi'. He seemed to be a middle aged family guy,later we thanked him numerously for driving us to one of the most beautiful but still less explored waterfalls which was not planned earlier.

The
Malnad wakes up
first place we stopped was a tea shop on the Chickmagalur-Kemmangudi road. After a long time I rediscovered the taste of 'Masala Buns' which was special in the coastal Karnataka region. After driving for another 30 minutes or so we stopped at 'The Deviramma Temple'. The place so serene as if the clock forgot to move ahead with time. Gaurav was enjoying so far as his silence said so. The temple was closed as it was around 7am. I was clicking around and was in love with this place literally. But we had a long road to hit, so unwillingly we both jumped in to the car and Mr.Ravi pulled the gear. This Chickmagalur-
Kemmangudi road was mainly laid out for the coffee estates which surrond the entire Malnad region. It was said that the first coffee plantation in India was started in this region first and later in The Nilgiris. Facts apart, we were enjoying the aroma of early morning brezze and Mr.Ravi was getting excited too.Mr.Sun was up meanwhile and we had to stop in between to greet him warmly.

Next stop was at Kalathi falls.I was pretty excited as I saw the photos earlier and was
Kemmangudi 'Z' point
planning to frame my creativity too.This falls is unique of it's type. There's a small temple at the base of this falls and the stream of water flows through temple.if you would like to make a visit to the temple, you perhaps need to walk through knee deep water. We reached Kalathi falls after 30-35 minutes drive but,'oh ! my god' was my first interaction. I did expect the stream of water would be less as it was an early summer,but I was more surprised rather frustrated to see a bunch of people taking bath,washing clothes,creating all sort of mess possible. I didn't take chance to click a single snap as it could have been a waste of time. Even Gaurav was frustrated too. I decided to go back to the car and continue for our next destination.

Next destination was The Hebbe falls. I was pretty anxious and frustrated after the Kalathi falls experience,but decided to make a visit to Hebbe still. Mr.Ravi told us previously that we needed to hire a Jeep from Kemmangudi to drive further 15kms to reach Hebbe. And accordingly, we settled for a jeep
or Rs 800/- and hoped in. Initially we thought
Wild Stream on the way to Hebbe Falls
the money was too high for a 15km drive, but later we had to change our views. The jeep left the tar road started climbing through the hills. The road was horrible,'No road' could have been a better word to say. Somehow we managed to grab a 'grip'. The driver,Chandu was trying his best to give us maximum confort but he couldn't do any better. We were riding on a road where 'dust and boulders' were laid out.Somehow after driving for an hour we reached a small place.Chandu suggested that we had to walk about a mile from here to reach The Hebbe falls. he also warned us to cross three wild streams through. Gaurav was fiercely excited as it seemed an adventurous walk indeed. We started walking and then we got the first stream to cross. The feeling was amazing, the water was freezingly cold.The track seemed utterly confusing but as suggested by Chandu, we maintained to walk down the stream. After crossing two more we got the first glimpse of 'The Mighty Hebbe Falls'.

'Dada, thank you, if I wouldn't have joined you,I could have missed one of the best sights of my life',that was Gaurav's expression.
Dhapa Dhapa Falls


I saw a few pics of Hebbe earlier but trust me none of them could do justice to this place. It was mesmerizing. Within a few seconds I started missing my sweetheart. I really don't have words to describe the beauty of this place.May Kalathi Falls have led us to frustration but this place have compensated more
with it's stature. It was depp inside thik lush green forests,amongst which from a roaring height mighty Hebbe Falls gorging down to a 200 mts stairs. I had an intention to take bath as there was aboslutely no one except us, but due to time constraints I had to give up the 'will' and started clicking around. Gaurav
was trying his best to take the best shots with his 'Nokia N8' cell phone. After spending an hour at the base of Hebbe, we strolled back thorugh the same way and following which took a ride through the 'boulder roads' back to Kemmangudi. My jeans was all dirty and I had to continue with the same pair for the rest of the day. But Hebbe took us to such a height that we forgot everything and were trying 'record' as many shots as
Hebbe Falls
we could. We kept playing our 'Hebbe pics' and promised Chandu and 'Hebbe' both that we would come back during upcoming monsoon.Somehow we two speechless souls sank deep into the thoughts of Hebbe. It was around 2pm, we had to stop for lunch,not for us buy atleast for Mr.Ravi. As we had your 'soul' filled with the beauty of Hebbe that we could have continued for the rest of the day. We stopped in a place at Attigundi for lunch and managed with steaming 'Chapathis and Chicken Masala'. Next destination was 'Dutta Peeth' at Bababudangiri Hill. But the beauty of Hebbe took us to 'sweeping feet' that we reamined much of 'silent pranks'.

The road from Kemmangudi to Bababudan giri as mixed bag of 'Bounty and Bumpy'. Around 3:00pm we
reached Bababudangiri and drove further to Manikyadhara view point. There was a narrow stream but due to insufficiency of water,it turned out to be a blunt one for us. But yes, the breathtaking view of the Chikmagalur Valley from Manikyadhara view point was 'woth' a visit to this place. We took a few clicks and then proceeded to our next destination.

After crossing a few wild streams and
Malnad Hills
somewhere in between the serenity, Mr.Ravi stopped the vehicle and gave us a big smile. We didn't understand the lines between.

'Anything happened?',I asked with curiosity.

'Any technical issues',Gaurav joined me as well.

'Sir, pack your cameras, trek down a mile and come back, it's a surprise gift from me',Ravi replied to all our questions with his smile.

I got his intention clear as I am always trustworhy to this local folks about something out of the box.

'Let's see',I asked Gaurav to get down and join me.

'Sir, this is a private place so make sure you go and come as early as possible',Mr.Ravi turned his FM on after stating this.

I was forming the 'cloud of questions' for me, what this place could hold for us.

'Dada, It seems some waterfalls',Gaurav broke the silence.

I was hearing a noise of a wild stream and was trying to judge the source of that noise.Hesitantly we started following that noise and after climbing further down about a mile the surprise was unfold. Mother nature carved this place with utmost secrecy and excellence. You guessed it right,It was a waterfall and
just
Rocky Malnad Hills
stunning. We have seen Hebbe earlier today but this place was no less than Hebbe. Stream of 'white satin' flowing down on a canvas of carving 'dark granite'. I was stunned and so was Gaurav. Again wherever we go serenity follows us. We were just the two 'souls' to enjoy the beauty of this 'mother
Nature's' marvel. When everything goes right something turns 'the table'. My Canon 60D blinked an unhappy warning of 'low battery'. Still we had the Mullayangiri left in our list. Left with no option,I switched my camera off and sat at one corner trying to feel the rhythm of nature. Gaurav was trying to
venture the neraby surroundings with a 'frame' to reach the 'higher ground'. Don't know what happened,I woke up from my dream as the time was clicking away.

After saying 'adieu' to this 'un named falls', we climbed back the same stroll and reached where mr.Ravi was waiting with his car.

Next stop was at Mullayangiri hills, we had plans to experience one of the most scenic sunset amongst the Malnad Hills. We reached Mullayangiri hills and climbed around 300 steps. Mullayangiri is the highest peak between The Himalayas and The
View from Manikyadhara view point
Nilgiris. There we met with Anand and Mansi,a wonderful couple who
drove all the way from Pune to this place to enjoy the beauty of Malnad hills. The sunset was worth a watch. Finally we climbed down the same stairs and drove back to Chikmagalur.

Another day was over from 'a few days' left in life.Indeed,We had the best of the Malnad hills.I am thanking Gaurav not only for joining me but being my 'cady' in this tour.

A snapshot of Chikmagalur :

How to get there :

By train : Nearest rail stations are Hassan and Kadur, from which Chickmagalur is 50 and 40kms respectively.A taxi would cost Rs. 1000-1200 from either of these places.

By road : Distance from Chickmagalur to Bangalore via Hassan-Tumkur is 245 kms. From Mysore 178 kms. The road condition is just amazing.



By Air : Bangalore - 245 kms and Mangalore - 151 km.

Where to stay; Chikmagalur has staying options aplenty. Starting from star category hotels to the budget family ones. We stayed at Hotel Soundarya Resinency.

Room rates are 900/- AC Double, 500/- Deluxe Double Non A/C.

Being a district
Sunset from Mullayangiri
town Chikmagalur has all the bank ATMs,Hospitals,Supermarkets. So you never run out of options.

Notes:

Chikmagalur to Kemmangudi can be reached via two routes

1) Chikmagalur-Deviramma Temple-Kalathi Falls-Kemmangudi

2) Chikmagalur-Bababudangiri-Attigundi-Bhadra WLS-Kemmangudi

Best would be to follow route 1 to reach Kemmangudi and then follow route 2 while returning. Infact that's what we did.

Hope this blog finds you in a happy note and if you have questions any, please let me know.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Ramanagaram
March 25th 2012
Published: March 25th 2012


Ramdevar beta is popularly known as Ramgad as pictorised in the famous Bollywood film Sholay. The place is a paradise for trekking, rock climbing and photo shooting. There are two temples on the top of the hill, viz, Rama temple and Rameshwar temple.
How to reach


Ramanagara, is about 50 kms from Bangalore, on Bangalore-Mysore highway. While coming from Mysore, it is about 90 kms from Mysore. While coming from Mysore, you have to cross Srirangapatna, Mandya and Channapatna to reach Ramanagara. Ramangara is famous for silk market and is know as the silk town.

One may go upto Ramanagar town by bus and then take an auto to Ramadevar beta. There is no facility to stay there overnight. So one has to plan the return trip on the same day.


Other places nearby



Sri Revana Siddeshwara Betta is also located in Ramanagara District about 70 Kms Away From Bangalore City. While visiting Ramadevar beta, one may plan to visit Revena Siddeshwar beta on the same day.

There is another place called Kengal hanumantharaaya temple which is also near to ramanagara City. Besides Janapadaloka and Kanwa resorvoir are nearby places which may be combined on a single trip.

There are about seven hills in 10Km radius of Ramanagara, viz, Yatirajagiri, Sidilakallu Betta Shivaramagiri, Krishnagiri, Somagiri, Revanna Siddeshwara Betta and Jala Siddeshwara Betta, Randevara Betta. All these sites offer abundant opportunities for trekking, camping and exploring the wilderness of nature.
What is there on Ramadevar Beta



There are quite a few granite hills around Ramanagaram, which are great attractions for adventure enthusiasts. Ramadevar beta is the same place known as Ramagad in the famous Bollywood film Sholay. The famous Gabbar Sing was sitting on this hill with Samba and Kaalia.



While entering in to the area, you will find a nice Arch welcoming you to the hills. There are plenty of places to climb and explore on both the sides of the road. Before reaching Ramadevar beta, you will see a Lotus Pond on the left. The pond is full of beautiful lotus. You may find children selling lotus there.



After seeing lotus pond and trekking nearby hill you may like to proceed further towards Ramadevar hill. The vehicle can go up to this place, the foot of ramadevar hill. You have to park your vehicle here and take the stairs to climb to the top of the hill.



From this entrance to the hill, you have to start climbing. You have to climb a total of around 300 steps. The route is in the middle of the forest and is quite exciting. While climbing the hill after 250 steps you will come across a Hanuman temple on the way.



Climbing is very exciting as because the stairs are very neat and clean amongst the dense forests and hills all around. This trekking is less risky and can be taken up by women, children provided you have enough strength to go up.



After climbing for about half an hour to one hour you will find Ramadevara temple on the top of the hill. The hill is famous because of this temple. The temple is more than 1000 years old as people say. Some people believe that Lord Rama had visited this place. From near the temple you can have a good view of the hills and places around.



Near Ramadevara beta, there is a natural pond on the hilltop, called Rama Tirtha. It is interesting to see water at such a height. However, the place is fenced and people are not allowed to go down to water for safety.

There is another temple called Rameshwar Temple about 30 meters away from Ramadevar Temple. You have to climb up a little to reach that temple. The pond Rama Tirtha is in between these two temples.



Near the temples on the top, there is a small tower. You can have a nice view of the hills from this place. The hills are 60 to 100 feet in height and very steep. Many professional rock climbers climb on these cliffs with equipments and proper safety measures. Many adventure groups come here for face climbing, boulder climbing, chimney climbing, hill climbing, rock climbing etc.



Ramadevara beta has something for everyone of every age group. All the shooting points of Sholay are still there. You can see beautiful rocks and nature around. The religious people can visit the temples. Besides this is an awesome place for shooting pictures.
Some more information



You should have sufficient time to move around the hills. The real pleasure is to climb and see. If you are lack of time, you cannot enjoy much.

Ramadevar beta and Siddheswhar beta are different, about 20 kms apart from each other. Some bloggers confuse between them and mix up the photos of Ramadevar beta with Siddheshwar beta.

Some bloggers mention Ramadevar beta as Randevar beta, both are same.

There are two temples on Ramadevar beta, one Rama temple and other Rameshwar temple. Besides there is a hanuman temple on the way while climbing.

How to reach


From Bangalore City, drive towards south till you reach Kanakapura road (you may take busy shortcut routes or long ring roads depending upon your location in Bangalore.). Now move on Kanakpura Road – the National Highway 209 – towards Kanakpura. After a few kms you will cross NICE ring road. Then after about 18 kms you will find a sign board to take a left turn for Buddha Pyramid.



Note: if you miss the road to pyramid valley then you will reach Horahalli, about 4 kms ahead. In that case you have to return back again.

From Kanakpura road diversion the road is rather easy. You just have to continue for about 2 kms on Kebbedoddi Village / Pyraimid Valley road. The road is good and motorable.
About the Pyramid Valley


Maitreya-Buddha Pyramid is world’s largest meditational pyramid. The size of the pyramid is 160ft. x 160ft. Height 102 ft (equivalent to 10 floor building). The pyramid was built in 2006. The capacity of the pyramid is to accommodate 5000 people for meditation.



There is accommodation available for halting in nights, ranging from dormitories to VIP suites. The valley is spread over 26 acres of land.

The energy in this Mega-Pyramid is amplified by over 640 natural Himalayan crystals fitted inside the hall. (Source: Pyramid Valley Brochure).

This Pyramid Valley has been selected as one of the 7 wonders of Bangalore , survey conducted by Bangalore Mirror (published by the Times of India group).





The Maitreya Pyramid is open 18 hours a day from morning till night. Buddha Poornima is the most auspicious day celebrated here. There is large gathering on the day with Aakhanda Dhyana (continuous meditation).
Some impressive facts


We were impressed to see the free services provided by the pyramid management. While in many other places you have to pay for everything, pyramid valley provides many facilities for free.

They give brochures and leaflets when you enter the valley as a token of greetings.

There is no vehicle parking fee in side the pyramid campus.

There is no money collection near the shoe stand.

There is no money collection for using toilets.

Free food is provided twice a day, at 1 PM and 8 PM, through annadana program.

Free meditation classes on Sundays and many more weekly and monthly spiritual development programs.
What to see in pyramid valley


The Maitreya Buddha pyramid is the main attraction of pyramid valley.

Apart from that there is meditation teaching place, an ampitheatre, a research center, a holistic health center, tree of life, bookstore, tapasthal, lake, gardens and statues.


Meditation inside pyramid


It is believed that Meditations done inside a Pyramid is three times more powerful. Many people experience great relaxations after meditating in pyramid. All are welcome (rather encouraged) to do meditation inside the pyramid. We also did meditation for half an hour inside the pyramid.

At the center of the pyramid there is an erected spot called King Chamber. This is about 34 ft tall and can accommodate about 30 people to sit and meditate. But it is said that the meditation done on this pedestal structure is even more powerful. However, this place is slightly hotter than the floor level because of its height. After meditating on kings chamber for some time we preferred to meditate on the floor which was much more spacious.



(Kings chamber inside pyramid. Photo courtesy: http://www.pyramidvalley.org)

The entrance halls at the base of the pyramid has many statues of Buddha and scripts of Buddha’s teaching. There are portraits of Brahmarshi Partriji who founded the pyramid valley. Photography is not allowed in this area and inside pyramid. Children below 6 years are not allowed inside the pyramid as they might create noise inside.

There are many more activities inside pyramid related to meditation and spiritual development. Some programs are weekly and some monthly. For details please refer to their site www.pyramidvalleyorg.
Food inside pyramid


You are not allowed to carry your food to do picnic in Pyramid valley. However, you get free food twice a day there.



Besides there is a cafeteria where you can buy foods of your choice. We took some idli, bada, fried rice etc. inside the cafetaria. It was good.



The cafeteria is open since 6.30 in the morning till 7.30 in the evening.
Overall Experience


The overall experience of Pyramid valley was excellent. The area is quite large and is enough to keep you busy walking and exploring various small items. You can walk near the lakes and gardens and enjoys statues here and there. The place is a must see for everybody staying in Bangalore and nearby.

How to go there:
You can follow any route to catch Bangalore Kanakapura main road – which is the National Highway 209. Go straight on the highway towards Kanakapura. After a few Kms you will cross NICE ring road. Go further on the highway. You will find “Art of Living” head quarter after 15 kms. Go further about 3 Kms, you will find a place called Kagalpura. Take a left turn from Kagalpura.
After taking the turn, go straight for about 1.5 kms till you find a hospital (?) / rehabilitation center where you have to take a left turn again. Better ask the locals otherwise you are very likely to miss this road as there is no proper landmark to explain. However, if you miss this road and go straight you will still reach the other side of TK falls through CRPF camp. But this road is longer and extremely rough for driving.



After turning left you have to drive 3 kms more to reach the fall, In some places you can see the river on the right side of the road. I had a fear that the road could be bad as many bloggers mention their experience. But luckily the road condition was good till we reached the fall.

What to see:

There is a temple called “Muneswar Temple” at the entrance to the fall. A small temple under a big tree. The place is peaceful.



Then you have to trek further in to the forest and rocks. Trekking is interesting but tiring too. One should better carry some food and drinking water for emergency. While going down to the water we came across a beautiful spot. A stone painted as forest god and some traditional art – jhoti- near it.



The rocks inside water look very attractive. They are interesting to climb. However, many of them are steep, smooth and slippery. One has to be very careful while climbing.



It was extremely hot and climbing too much was very tiring. We finished three bottles of water that we carried. Although there was no water in the fall, the place was still enjoyable. It can be said to be a good picnic spot.



We spent about 2 hours in the place and then proceeded for Pyramid Valley, which is on the same Kanakapura road about 15 kms from TK falls.

January 28th 2014
Published: February 6th 2014


Koyawara hospital
Location of the Seva Mandir maternal and child health clinic
I am doing a 1 month internship with the NGO Seva Mandir in Udaipur. Elise is doing a 6 month internship. Elise learnt of Seva Mandir as she researched her plan for a career in international development.

My work at Seva Mandir is in the health section, as compared with the education, empowerment, natural resources, governance sections. The philosophy of volunteering here is that the work you do both meets of the needs of the volunteer and those of the organisation. My project will be to write a report on a pilot project of a new maternal and child health clinic associated with a village hospital. This is a new model of care for the area, building upon an existing system of traditional birthing attendants and maternal and child assistants (Bal Sakhis). Neither of these groups of women have health training, and the former are illiterate. The hospital is at Kojawara in the Udaipur district. This is about 85km south of the city of Udaipur.

Elise and I will work together on this project. We will draw the data from the clinic registers, and do the analysis on the distribution of symptoms, diseases, treatments and outcomes. Also, there will
A much welcomed child
This woman had had multiple miscarriages over 7 years. She came to the clinic, received treatment and her daughter was born 3 years ago
be some case studies of women and children who have used the service, and also an overview of the village (sanitation, water supply, health related facilities). Elise will also work in this project. The report will be used for advocacy and funding for continuation of the clinic and hopefully expansion to other areas.

The jeep goes to the clinic 3 days a week, and we will go out as required. Travelling there, the country side is fairly barren, rugged country with many hills and valleys. The hospital is out through the outskirt slum areas of Udaipur, onto the main 4 lane toll road, and then onto smaller and smaller roads. Kojawara is a small village and the hospital about 1km from the village. The hospital is a set of about 4 single level, small interconnected buildings. The doctor resigned mid last year, so actually the only health care happening there is the Seva Mandir clinic.

The jeep takes the clinic doctor from Udaipur out each day, and translators as required. Right on 11 the women and children started to arrive. Most came with their Bal Sakhis as support, and of course all walked there. The women appeared happy,
Women and children at the clinic
and welcomed us with smiles. They were very colourfully dressed. Many were pregnant, although with a saree it is hard to tell if a woman is pregnant till the latter months. The clinic finishes at 4.

Since Oct 2012, when the project started, the clinic has seen about 4000 women and children. For the women the health issues relate to prenatal and antenatal care, gynaecological problems, with a small amount of general primary health care. For the children, the issues are respiratory, skin, ear infections, as well as malaria, anaemia and malnutrition. There is some capacity to refer the more serious cases to other health facilities.

The clinic patients some from about 100 villages in the area, with about 40% from Kojawara. The patients walk to the clinic.

When we are not at the hospital, we work in the Seva Mandir offices at Udaipur. Elise is also working on an income generation project for women (making and selling laundry detergent), and on a project to enhance school attendance in a specific village. One of the charms of working at the office is the chai wallah, who constantly does the office rounds selling chai at 8c/glass.

Mysore
Le palais en tenue de nuit
20 mars 2012, Mysore et Ooty

Après un train de nuit de 12heures qui s’est, comme toujours, bien déroulé, nous sommes arrivés à Mysore, une ville de taille moyenne au centre du Karnataka. Bien qu’on ait choisit cette ville prime à bord pour transiter vers les montagnes, nous y sommes restés 4 jours. Nous avons visité un magnifique palais différent de ce que nous avions vu jusqu’ici, celui-ci mêlant une architecture européenne de style baroque au style indien. J’étais bien désolée que les photographies à l’intérieur soient interdites, mais on a pu se reprendre sur l’extérieur qui s’illumine les soirs de fin de semaine, des ampoules parcourant tous les contours du palais et de ses arches d’entrée. Magnifique!

Mysore a aussi un marché central qui vaut le détour pour ses étales colorés de fruits, légumes, fleurs, soieries et menus objets en bois de santal (spécialité de la région). C’était jusqu’ici notre plus belle expérience dans un marché en Inde et on en a profité pour voir comment sont fabriqués les bâtons d’encens, acheter des fruits et des fleurs, et, bien évidemment, prendre des photos! Une seule chose à ne pas faire… Nous soupçonnons les fleurs que j’ai laissé dans
Mysore
la chambre être à l’origine d’une infestation de mini-mouches. N’évoquant pas cette raison, nous avons demandé d’être changé de chambre à 11h pm parce que la centaine de mouches qui volait au-dessus de notre lit pouvait même traverser notre filet!

Les autres journées, on a monté 1000 marches (plus pour s’entraîner que pour atteindre un sommet où se trouvent un temple), on est allé se promener dans la ville puis au zoo (qui parfois peut nous sembler plus civilisé) et on a visité le Rail Museum (qui ressemblait plus à un parc pour enfants qu’autre chose). En fait, c’est mon chum ingénieur qui a rendu la visite intéressante en m’expliquant le fonctionnement des vieilles locomotives à vapeur! Et le reste du temps je l’ai passé au lit, prise de manifestations intestinales incontrôlables et de douleurs musculaires qui semblaient être sur chaque parcelle de mon corps. Même mon cuir chevelu était douloureux!

La dernière journée, à la centrale d’autobus, j’ai engloutit le jus d’une noix de coco pour me réhydrater, suite au conseil d’une indienne qui m’a vu passer au pas de course 2 fois de suite en 15 minutes, armée de mon rouleau de papier de toilettes. Paraîtrait-il
Mysore-marche
que ce jus légèrement salé est naturellement bourré d’électrolytes. Hey ben, qui l’aurait cru ! Non seulement je vais me coucher moins niaiseuse, mais mieux réhydratée. Yeah!

J’ai tout de même dû avoir recours aux grands moyens pour poursuivre notre route. C’est donc bien bouchée d’immodium que j’ai pu aisément profiter de mon 5 heures de bus climatisé dans les Nilgiris Hills. On a traversé des plantations de thé à flancs de montagnes, puis un parc national, où l’on a aperçu des éléphants sauvages! Ils étaient tout simplement magnifiques, d’un beau gris charcoal avec de longues défenses couleur, vous aurez deviné : ivoire! Et comme ce parc de 320km2 compte 600 têtes de leur espèce, il n’est pas surprenant de croiser des pancartes de traverses d’éléphants sur la route! Malheureusement, dû aux risques élevés de feux forêt en saison sèche, on ne peut pas y faire de trekking. Ce n’est pas grave; on a un plan B qui promet…. à suivre!

On est donc maintenant à Ooty, une petite ville en montagnes. Après Hampi et Mysore où la température atteignait 30° le jour, on se réjouit du 20° de Ooty et des soirées suffisamment fraîches pour porter une

Les fleurs sont surtout vendus en guirlande et servent souvent d'offrandes dans els temples. Les femmes se les accrochent aussi dans les cheveux; non-merci pour moi!
petite laine!

Est-ce que je vous ai dit que depuis notre arrivée nous avons que des journées ensoleillées, sans nuage ni une seule goutte de pluie ?!

Sur ce, bonne journée!

L’indiennerie du jour : à un quai d’embarquement, plutôt que d’attendre son tour pour monter dans un autobus, un homme a monté et poussé son petit garçon dans une fenêtre pour se réserver une place!

Hi there,

It doesn't seem like five minutes ago I was writing about Nepal and now it's time to give you the latest on our trip round India! Since Lewys' has already written his blog and told some of the funnier anecdotes I'll do my best to make this interesting...



India, where do I start? Even as I'm writing I know how impossible it's going to be to describe our first two weeks in this amazing country. I had read about it, I had seen pictures and I'd spoken to people who have visited, but nothing can prepare you for actually being here.



Delhi hits you like a ton of bricks. We thought Kathmandu was crazy but nothing compared to the mayhem that is Delhi. The city is just huge and and there are more people that you could possibly imagine - think rush hour in London, only with a lot more people, more noise, more filth, more traffic and more cows. Now imagine that as you walk down the street, dodging piles of rubbish, speeding motorbikes and wandering cattle, you are also the centre of attention. Every person stares at you when you walk past, asks you if you need a tuk-tuk, a sari, a USB stick or a pair of sunglasses (even though you are wearing sunglasses). ""Hello my friend...come into my shop"" echoes down the street and rickshaws crawl along beside you just in case after saying no five times you miraculously change your mind.



Every day in India has been an 'experience'. Every day throws up new challenges to test your patience, your level of tolerance is constantly pushed to the limit and your ability to cope with new situations is challenged. The stark contrast between the very rich and the impossibly poor is in evidence everywhere and poverty rears its ugly head wherever you go. Unlike Nepal, where there isn't such a wealthy elite, in India there is a clear divide between the haves and have-nots, which is hard to reconcile.India has also been fascinating. The places we have seen have been unforgettable, steeped in the history and the past grandeur of empires. The mighty subcontinent is vast and so far we have only seen a small part of it.



Our first full day in Delhi, still slightly shell-shocked, we wandered down Chandi Chouk, the main bazaar in Old Delhi. This huge street, lined with sari shops and spice sellers, leads up the majestic Red Fort - once the seat of the Mughal Empire. The guide book describes the fort as a ""sandstone carcass of its former self"", but I thought the crumbling ruins gave a fitting glimpse into the decadence that once had its home here. We also saw the Jama Masjid Mosque, which offers a relatively peaceful oasis in the middle of the crazy and crowded old city.



After a day in the capital we started our whistlestop tour of Rajasthan - the desert state. The first stop was Agra (actually in Uttar Pradesh but near to Rajasthan). It turned out to be more difficult than we thought to get to (see Lewys' blog for full details of us turning up a month early for our train and a pigeon using my head as a toilet). Agra itself isn't much to look at but the main attraction, the Taj Mahal, doesn't disappoint. With its perfect goemetric shape and flawless white marble walls that shimmer in the dawn sunlight it looks unreal, almost etherial. It manages to balance perfect simplicity with the most elaborate detail and is far more beautiful than I had imagined. Another, more unexpected delight in Agra was the impressive fort, which sits along the banks of the Yamuna River. Apart from the small Indian man of about 40 who asked if Lewys was my husband and tried to take pictures of me, twice, it was a beautiful place to spend the afternoon.



En route from Agra to Jaipur we stopped for a night in Fatehpur Sikri, a small town with an historic fort (yep, another fort!). We got quite a bit of hassle here, mostly from young guys who claimed they weren't guides but 'students' wanting to give a free tour to practice their English - a likely story! The highlight was sitting in the magnificent mosque and watching the sun set.



Jaipur was not my favourite place. We were pestered a lot by tuk-tuk drivers and I was stared at constantly by Indian men because of my blonde hair and fair skin - I think we both found it pretty difficult to deal with sometimes. We visited the City Palace, which was ok but compared with the simple elegance of the Taj Mahal it seemed gaudy and over the top to me. Climbing the 'Heaven Piercing Minaret', however, gave us a spectacular view over the city. It was originally built so that the ladies of the court could watch the happenings of the city below, and it still offers an amazing vista of the pink city.



The next stop was Jodhpur, the pretty blue city which nestles below the imposing Mehrangarh Fort (that's 4 and counting). Jodhpur was much smaller and therefore more manageable than the other cities we had visited. The colourful bazaar that surrounds the clocktower and main square was a great place to wander around and haggle over silk scarves (Lewys was less interested in this, not sure why..). The fort itself was also my favourite out of the many we saw in Rajathan because it was really well-maintained and there was a free audio-tour, which was really interesting (yes, I'm that cool). We ended up spending a few days longer in Jodhpur than we'd planned because Lewys was ill, but it meant we could see the crazy Holi festival there. People have bonfires and throw colored powder and water over eachother - we got a soaking from some kids who threw a bucket of water over us from their balcony, then they pulled faces and ran away!



Our last city to see in Rajasthan was Jaisalmer, a fort town that was even smaller again and on the edge of the Thar Desert. There we did the obligatory 'Jeep"" (closer to Lewys' Citroen ZX than any jeep I've ever seen) and Camel safari. We were a little short on time so we only spent an afternoon riding the Camels among the nearest available sand-dunes, which was long enough I think (some people do it for nearly two weeks - I think saddle-sore would be an understatement!). It was a fun afternoon and it was really nice to get out of the city for the first time in 2 weeks. Our camel driver Nihal and his little son were great and made the experience really enjoyable. After a couple of hours riding around we stopped to watch the fiery sun set over the endless horizon - definitely worth it.



Our trip around Rajasthan ended with a lovely 19 hour sleeper train back to Delhi, which was surprisingly ok. Next we make our way to the South, which I think is a lot more relaxed than the north and so will have more of a holiday atmosphere (so I'm told!). Rajathan is an amazing part of India and I think we were definitely thrown in at the deep end starting there. Despite all the 'annoyances' we've had an incredible couple of weeks.



Well that's all for now, hope you enjoyed my ramblings!

Lots of Love xxx

March 15th 2012

Bonjour and welcome to the second instalment of my Asia travel blog...

We arrived in Delhi on the 25th of Feb after a pretty scenic flight from Kathmandu. Although a seasoned traveller of the subcontinent (I visited for a few weeks with Dad, Kylie and Andrew when I was 5 years old), this was to be nearly 3 weeks that I won't forget in a hurry.

Delhi is without a doubt the busiest, noisiest, dirtiest and most abrasive place I have ever been. Once the jewel in the crown of the opulent Mughal Empire, it's now almost impossible to picture the splendour and wealth that once existed here. We spent a couple of days looking around, visiting the Red Fort and the Jama Masjid before catching the train to Agra. This wasn't quite as straightforward as it sounds. After spending an hour and a half at the mayhem that is New Delhi Railway Station attempting to book a ticket, we gave up. 'Luckily', we managed to book a ticket through our hostel for the following morning. Rising at 7, we set off in a taxi to Nizamuddin Railway Station only to find that our train was departing in a month's time. Cheers. To put the icing on the cake a pigeon relieved itself on Kat's head as we stepped out of the station. Welcome to India.

There's no doubt that the Taj Mahal was worth all the trouble. The most beautiful building I have ever seen and so much bigger than you expect it to be. Amazing.

From Agra we caught the bus to Fatehpur Sikri, once the capital of India for fourteen years. There's an incredible mosque and fort there but the amount of hassle we got from 'tour guides', 'students' and 'ticket sellers' was just ridiculous (even by Indian standards) and did spoil the experience somewhat. I've discovered that speaking Welsh to people who are particularly persistent helps quite a lot...

Jaipur was the next stop (a 5 hour bus journey extended by a break down). Known as the Pink City, it has over 3 million inhabitants and is everything you expect a big Indian city to be - noisy, chaotic and unbelievably polluted. To be honest, the highlight here was the cable TV in the hostel - cricket on 24/7. Indians are genuinely obsessed with cricket and if you ask any Indian who their favourite player is, there is only one answer - Sachin.

The train journey to Jodhpur was not particularly straightforward (noticing a trend..?). This one was delayed by 5 hours so we spent a thrilling afternoon in a waiting room at Jaipur Railway Station. Jodhpur is far nicer than Jaipur and has an incredible fort (known as Mehrangarh) towering over the city. We spent a few days here looking around Mehrangarh, the Clock Tower bazaars and the winding back streets. I managed to find myself a fantastic waterproof, glow-in-the-dark watch and a silly hat to keep the sun off my head for a grand total of 1 pound and 40 pence. The watch is still working if you're wondering...

Sadly I was struck down by the inevitable travel sickness that comes with visiting India whilst in Jodhpur. The less said about that the better, but it did mean I missed the Hindu festival of Holi - where everybody throws colourful powder and water on each other and get very drunk. Pretty gutting.

The last stop on our whirlwind tour of Rajasthan was Jaisalmer (getting there involved an incredibly hot crowded 6 hour bus journey with no toilet or food stops. Painful.). It's almost impossible to visit Jaisalmer without going into the desert on a camel so, after barely having put our bags down, we'd booked an afternoon's excursion into the Great Thar Desert.

Setting off in our 'jeep' (actually something resembling a Vauxhall Corsa), we travelled about 40km before hopping on a camel and travelling a bit further through the desert until we found some sand dunes (a rarity in the Great Thar Desert). From here we watched the sunset, which was absolutely amazing. Incidentally, riding a camel is not so different from riding a horse, except you are a lot higher up and they have stupidly long necks.

Finally, we hopped on the 19 hour sleeper train back to Delhi (only three quarters of an hour late!). Sharing a bed with both my bags isn't the most comfortable but we have 3 more sleepers booked for South India so I better get used to it!

I don't think there's been an easy day in India yet. We've seen some incredible things and met some great people, but I never thought that just being in a place could be such a test of personality and patience. I find that I'm pretty much constantly see-sawing between loving and hating this country... Quite an experience. There's so much more I could have written but I think that's probably enough for now as I'm in a very sweaty internet cafe (in Bangalore). We head off to Hampi tonight before making our way down to the beaches of Kerala.

I hope all's well back home,

Lots of love,

Lewys

Holi Hampi 2
Nos munitions!
14 mars 2012, Hampi, Karnataka

Happy Holî !!

Encore endormis et endoloris de notre brève nuit en bus, on débarque en plein centre d’une allée de ruines bordée de palmiers, centrée sur un énorme temple digne de quel film cette fois-ci ? Je dirais… Indiana Jones! Après que mon Indi à moi nous ait sauvés des sauvages chauffeurs de rickshaw en les envoyant cavalièrement promener, nous nous sommes dirigés à pieds vers le mystérieux village de Hampi. La ville baignait déjà dans une atmosphère de fête à 8h30, les enfants courant dans les ruelles avec des bouteilles d’eau colorée et nous regardant d’un air espiègle…

En poursuivant nos recherches de Guesthouse, on nous a gentiment recommandé de rapidement se loger et de se nourrir avant 10h, avant que tout soit fermé, faute de devoir aller fêter! Wouhou!

Le Holî est une fête religieuse dédiée au dieu Kâma, qui souligne également l’arrivée du printemps, et qui tient lieu à la pleine lune de février-mars. La tradition veut que l’on asperge nos amis de couleurs aux différentes significations : le vert pour l’harmonie, l’orange pour l’optimisme, le bleu pour la vitalité et le rouge pour la joie et l’amour.
Holi Hampi 1
Pour ce faire, on porte nos plus laids vêtements, on achète des poignées de poudres colorées que l’on étend ou lance sur les autres, peu importe qui, en dansant aux rythmes des tambours. Évidemment que Phil et moi y avons participé! Avec chacun un petit indien grimpé sur nos épaules, on a suivi la foule jusqu’à ce que la fatigue prenne le dessus. Voir les photos et vidéo pour le résultat : un 2 heures de pure folie!! On a a-do-ré! Le seul hic, c’est que ça va prendre plus d’une douche pour faire partir le jaune dans mes cheveux, le mauve dans mon cou et le rouge sur le bord de mon nez… mais tout le village est dans cette situation!

Mais si nous sommes venus à Hampi, c’est prime à bord pour son patrimoine archéologique au cœur d’un paysage lunaire : des dizaines de temples en ruines bordés d’une frange de palmiers et de bananiers, le tout perdu dans une mer d’immenses rochers d’une couleur sable. Ces mastodontes arrondis par le temps sont empilés les uns sur les autres, et leur origine demeure un mystère pour les scientifiques, leur présence dans la région étant unique et isolée.
Holi Hampi 3
De faux Sadhu.. qui vous demandent des dons, evidemment..
Quand on approche les ruines des temples, on a l’impression d’arriver dans un oasis au milieu d’un désert, le soleil, la chaleur et le silence étant de la partie.

Nous soupçonnons que ces rochers ont été coupés et façonnés en colonnes et poutres pour les temples, comme le témoignent des séries d’encoches identiques sur les arrêtes des colonnes puis sur des rochers environnants. Il y a deux choses qui me fascinent de ces temples : la structure qui semble tenir que par l’emboîtement des pièces, et les figures sculptées en haut-relief dans la pierre, dont le motif peut etre surprenant! (Voir les photos)

On a passé la moitié de notre temps à visiter ces temples, et l’autre moitié à se perdre! On a entre autres marché sur une petite route de campagne assez longtemps pour littéralement changer de village plutôt que de trouver un des sites majeurs, allongeant notre marche d’un bon 6 kilomètres. Oups! (Oui Emman, mon sens de l’orientation légendaire n’a que celui de Phil comme égal!). Le jour suivant, on a traversé la rivière et on a marché dans un paysage semblable à celui du voisin d’en face, mais où les temples étaient remplacés par
Holi Hampi 4
des rizières. C’est jusqu’ici le plus beau paysage que j’ai vu en Inde!

Mis à part Holî-Hampi, on a eu l’occasion de pousser nos observations sur les vaches indiennes. Constat : leur quantité et leur taille est inversement proportionnel à la grosseur des villes, les vaches ‘’urbaine’’ n’appartiennent à personne et sont libres de se promener partout en ville, et elles ne se rassemblent en troupeau que le soir. D’ailleurs, chanceux comme on est, il y en a une vingtaine qui dorment sous notre fenêtre de chambre. L’autre soir, alors que Phil respirait l’air frais, il a vu un Japonais contourné le troupeau en grimpant sur un muret. Coup de théâtre : en sautant de son perchoir, le Japonais a atterri directement dans une grosse bouse de vache bien fraîche! Depuis cette nuit, nous avons toujours une lampe frontale avec nous pour voir où nous marchons lorsque la panne électrique quotidienne survient. Ou pour ne pas marcher sur les propriétaires du Guesthouse qui dorment à même le sol dans l’entrée, ce qui est une pratique courante en Inde pour les propriétaires et employés de commerces, restaurants et hôtels.

Sur ce, Happy Holî, d’autant plus que le printemps semble
Holi Hampi 5

Mahishasura
That's me in front. Demons are silly, not dangerous.
Mysore is a beautiful clean city—lots of gardens. It is the home of sandalwood perfume. Enjoy the pictures!

We learned a little about Hinduism. Three levels: Gods—but there are many and you get to choose the one you like, example, God of trees or rain, or whatever. Second come humans who can choose to be good or bad—issue of karma comes into this. Third group are demons. Demons aren’t bad—they are just silly. More powerful than humans because they can change their shape and appearance.



A little more on cows. Cows are sacred in their importance. In the old days, when a dispute was settled, a cow was offered as a gift. Cows provide milk, value as a farm animal, their dung is insulation, their urine is a cleaning agent. As well, their urine is still valued in making medicines—as it has been for 3-4,000 years. A cow is not eaten—it must be cremated. It is bad luck to have a cow die on you (plus you have to pay for the cremation), so many people turn them loose. That is why there are street cows everywhere—even walking down the middle of busy highways.

By the
Nandi
Cows are associated with Hinduism. This one is third biggest in India.
way, the language spoken in this region is Kannada—pronounced just the way you would think.

A note about security around here. We go through scanners everywhere—monuments, public buildings and even our hotels. Often, we go through a scanner, our bags so through a scanner and then we get “wanded” and/or patted down. Women go through a separate scanner and female attendants frisk us behind a closed curtain. Takes a long time.

The British gave India a postal system and an educational system, but they also left them with a crazy bureaucracy. I learned that when I got my Indian visa in Ottawa—that was just frustrating! One incident here was at a high end hotel in Jaipur. This was the day I got up at 3:15 am to catch a 6 am flight to southern India. I handed in my room key and was handed a customer service questionnaire. It was a full page of fine print that appeared to cover every detail of the last few days. I wasn’t in the best mood, and really wanted a coffee. I pushed it back and said, “no, everything was just fine.” They asked me to just put my name and
Street Cows
But then there are street cows like this one. They are everywhere, cars just swerve around them.
room number. I scribbled that and handed it back. They said that I had to fill it out. I said that I didn’t have my reading glasses—I really wanted that cup of coffee and remember, it is four o’clock in the morning. They suggested that I just check off everything in the “excellent” column. I took the form and when they weren’t looking, I hid it under a plant. Even the street cows don’t have this hassle.



Namaste!

Gokarna-en route
Un deguisement pour mendier
9 Mars 2012, Gokarna, Karnataka

Namasté!

On a terminé notre semaine à Palolem avec un verre de vin rouge indien. C’était disons… correct. Le clou de ma soirée a plutôt été la comparaison entre notre guide Lonely Planet et celui de nos voisins israéliens, rédigé en hébreu. C’est fascinant comme écriture! Ils écrivent de la droite vers la gauche, sens également dans lequel on tourne les pages. Par conséquent, la page couverture se trouve où le verso de nos livres. Et comme ils écrivent de la droite vers la gauche, leur alphabet semble à l’envers du nôtre, comme un effet miroir. L’effet est d’autant plus saisissant quand il y a des illustrations, leur sens commun contrastant avec notre perception inverse de l’écriture. Une lutte pour le cerveau, je vous jure… Bref, si vous avez la chance de feuilleter un livre en hébreu, faites-le, c’est bien meilleur qu’un verre de vin indien!

On a quitté Palolem en bus pour Gokarna, 60km plus bas sur la côte. C’était un bus local, dans lequel nous avons débuté notre chemin debout dans l’allée. Je regrettais de ne pas avoir mis mes bas de pantalons. Moi qui me disais que je passerais inaperçue
Gokarna
Temple en face de mon Guesthouse
parce que je serais assise, je me suis retrouvée avec 25 paires de yeux braqués sur mes genoux. Mes shorts ne sont même pas ‘’shorts’’ !! Des vraies shorts de brousse je vous dis… Même Angelina Jolie n’aurait pas l’air sexy avec ça sur le dos! Mais bon. On apprend. Mais n’empêche que je trouvais mes shorts moins dérangeantes que l’odeur des poissons que vendait une madame DANS la bus, et qu’un monsieur juste à côté de moi a acheté! On peut arrêter de regarder, mais pas de respirer quand même! Blague à part, je respecte leur culture et le code vestimentaire qui vient avec, et pour préserver une harmonie avec mes hôtes, je me promène désormais en jupe longue jusqu’aux chevilles!

Gokarna est une toute petite ville très charmante et très tranquille, perdue au cœur d’une forêt de palmiers, entre deux plages. Il y a des temples partout, dont un devant et derrière notre Guesthouse. Plusieurs fois par jour et à diverses endroits de la ville, ils y sonnent des cloches dans une mélodie digne du film ‘’7 ans au Tibet’’. Vous voyez le genre? C’est hypnotisant! L’atmosphère particulièrement spirituelle qui y règne est très calme et sereine,
Gokarna
Un chariot pour des processions vers un temple
et elle attire une grande population de rastas occidentaux de tous les styles : colorés, dans la barbe, la moitié du coco, jusqu’aux fesses, etc. Au moins 2/3 des touristes ont des rastas!

On a ensuite pris un bus de nuit avec couchette pour Hampi, au centre du Karnataka. Le sommeil n’a pas été des plus réparateurs, l’état des routes nous faisant parfois sauter jusqu’à 3’’ au-dessus du matelas! À notre agréable surprise, les couchettes sont doubles ce qui permet de passer le trajet collée sur son amoureux. Ce qui doit être moins agréable si vous voyagez seul, parce que vous devrez partager votre couche avec un étranger du même sexe!

À notre arrivée, une surprise nous attendait à Hampi: le festival Holî, dite la fêtes des couleurs! Je termine avec une photo de moi pour vous donner avant-goût du festival, alors que les détails suivront dans la prochaine chronique, même Bat-Heure, même Bat-Chaîne!

Halebid-2
Al naar (slechte) gewoonte, blijft de laatste blog-episode verweesd achter in een ‘pending file’😞

Het goede nieuws is dan weer dat de publicatie van het slot van de vorige reis doorgaans het voorteken is van een volgend project 😊.

Inderdaad, maar hierover later meer…



Eerst onze laatste dagen Zuid-India.




Vrijdag 02/03/12 – van Mysore naar Hassan


Vandaag rijden we van Mysore naar Hassan, een handige basis waaruit we de wondermooie tempels van Belur en Halebid, en de bedevaartsoord Sravanabelagola zullen verkennen.



Eerst een beetje relaxen in de weelderige ‘gemanicuurde’ tuinen met azuurblauw zwembad van het Hoysala Villlage Resort . Toegegeven, dit is er wat over, maar uiterst genietbaar! … en het restaurant is navenant 😊




Zaterdag 03/03/12 – Belur, Halebid en Sravanabelagola


De Hoysala tempels van Halebid (Halebeedu) en Belur (Beluru) vertegenwoordigen, samen met Somnathpur, zowat het hoogtepunt van een van de meest artistiek-exuberante periode in de ontwikkeling van de oude Hindoe-cultuur.

Architectonisch worden ze beschouwd als de Zuid-Indiase tegenhanger van Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh en Konark bij Puri in Odisha (Orissa).

Het beeldhouwwerk is zo verfijnd dat het wel
Halebid-7
kant lijkt... ware stenen gedichten ter ere van de Hindoegoden... en ter verheerlijking van de (aardse?) vrouw

De bouw van het Channakeshava Tempel in Belur werd aangevat in de 12de eeuw A.D., meer dan 200 jaar voor de start van de constructie van de OLV-kathedraal van Antwerpen

Het Hoysaleswara Temple in Halabid dateert uit dezlfde periode, maar werd nooit volledig afgewerkt. Het blijft echter een toonbeeld van de Hoysala-architectuur.

Op weg naar Bengaluru houden we nog even halte in het bedevaartsoord Sravanabelagola.

De blootvoetse steile beklimming van de 614 treden leiden ons naar een kale heuveltop waarop een het 17,5m hoge monolithisch beeld van de naakte Jain-godheid Gomateshvara in alle sereniteit mediteert. De eenvoud van dit kunstwerk uit de 10de eeuw A.D. staat in schril contrast met de gekunsteldheid van beeldhouwwerk dat we deze ochtend nog bewonderden in Belur & Halebid.

Een laatste rustpunt voor we ons weer storten in het chaos van Bengaluru (Bangalore) op weg terug naar huis.

Grijze langoer
onderweg naar Mysore



Maandag 27/02/2012 – van Kochi naar Conoor

Lange transferdag (geen foto's).

We ruilen de broeioven (rond 40°C !) voor de veel koelere Nilgiriheuvels (Conoor ligt op ± 1.850m).



Wanneer je de grote baan van Kochi naar Mettupalayam (Coimbatore) volgt, waan je je midden in een XXXL Lifestyle magazine : gigantische billboards - soms wel een voetbalveld groot !!!) met reclame voor luxeproducten ontnemen je elk zicht op het landschap. Je rijdt als het ware van de ene bladzijde naar de andere...



Gelukkig stopt deze publicitaire overdaad aan de grens met Tamil Nadu, waar dit soort extravaganza - gelukkig - ietwat aan banden wordt gelegd, zodat we velden, dorpen en bossen weer kunnen zien...



In Conoor is niet zoveel te beleven, maar het is onze opstapplaats naar Udhagamandalam (Ooty).













Dinsdag 28/02/2012 – per 'Toy Train' van Conoor naar Ooty



Onze trein vertrekt pas in de late namiddag. Ondertussen gaan we op verkenning in de Nilgiris'Hills, gelegen op het drielandenpunt tussen Tamil Nadu, Kerala en Karnataka.



Van op de
Nilgiris Hills-7
Telescoop House op de Dodabetta (2.880 m - het hoogste punt van Zuid-India) heb je een quasi 360° panorama over de Eastern - en (voornamelijk) de Werstern Ghats. Belangrijkste activiteit : poseren voor de foto!





Door het meer gematigd klimaat op deze hoogtes, vind je hier op deze groene heuvels zowat 27%!v(MISSING)an de flora van India en 60%!v(MISSING)an de medicinale planten in het land.



Theeplantages en tuinbouw vormen hier het gros van de locale economie.



De Toy Train

Iets dat je hier absoluut niet mag missen is een ritje met de 'Toy Train'.

De 'Nilgiri Mountain Railway' is samen met de 'Daejeeling Himalayan Railway' (in het Noordoosten van India), door UNESCO uitgeroepen tot Werelderfgoed.



De oorspronkelijke Zwitserse koolgestookte stoomlocomotieven dateren uit de periode 1918-1920 en werden aangevuld in 1949-1950. Ze worden thans stilaan vervangen door nieuwe oliegestookte Indische exemplaren gebouwd naar het oorspronkelijk model (de 2de werd op 27/02/2012 geleverd in Coimbatore).



Omwille van de helling en het feit dat op het laatste segment geen tandrad systeem aanwezig is, wordt voor het traject Conoors - Ooty gebruik gemaakt van
Nilgiris Hills-1
een diesellocomotief.



Het treintje slingert zich tussen de bossen. Even wordt erg warm wanneer we door een licht uit de hand gelopen bermbrand moeten. Over deze brandjes is, in de volgende dagen, een hele polemiek ontstaan, zeker wanneer het 'Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve - een verzameling beschermde zones en Nationale Parken - getroffen hebben.

Volgens de locale kranten staat vast dat ze door mensen zijn aangestoken, maar nopens de doelstelling lopen er verschillende hypothesen (van gecontroleerd, om een ziekte uit te roeien, tot puur vandalisme...)



Hoe dan ook, de treinrit is erg genietbaar.









Woensdag 29/02/2012 – van Ooty naar Mysore



Onze weg naar Mysore leid ons door de 'Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve', want je moet door het Bandipur National Park.

Opeenvolgende (stevige) verkeersdrempels moeten snelheid ontraden, maar gewone verkeersborden zijn ontoereikend om het wild getoeter in te perken. Veel wild is er dan ook langs de weg niet te zien. Hoewel : we worden getrakteerd op enkele Indische olifanten(Elephas maximus indicus), chitals of Axisherten (Axis axis), hoelmans of grijze langoeren of ook nog Hanumanlangoer (Semnopithecus entellus), enkele makaken (Macaca radiata), en wat wilde zwijnen... (nog altijd beter dan in het Periyar N.P. !)



Nilgiris Hills-2




Donderdag 01/03/2012 – Mysore



In Mysore knopen we weer aan met het verkeerschaos en het concert van toeters en claxons...



Ons Hotel belooft ons een onneembaar zicht op de grandeur van Mysore Palace, vanop het dakterras... maar weelderige bomen steken daar - letterlijk - een stokje voor... Gelukkig zijn de bomen prachtig...



Mysore Palace

Dit fantastisch paleis, de voormalige zetel van de Wodeyar maharajas, hoort bij de fraaiste koninklijke gebouwen van India.

Het oude paleis werd door brand vernietigd in 1897; het huidige werd afgewerkt in 1912, en is het werk van de Engelse architect Henry Irwin.



Het interieur van dit Indo-Saraceense pracht – een caleidoscoop van glasramen, spiegels en weelderige kleuren – is ongetwijfeld (zwaar) 'over the top'. Het decor is verfraaid met gesculpteerde deuren - in hout of zelfs zilver - mozaïek vloeren en een reeks muurschilderingen die het 'dagelijks' leven in Mysore ten tijde van de Raj afbeelden.

Helaas is fotograferen hier ook verboden (maar dank zij internet kan je hier een volledige rondgang volgen).



Elke zon- en feestdag wordt het gebouw opgeluisterd door ruim 100.000
Nilgiris Hills-6
gloeilampen, alsof het Kerstmis is. (Dat hebben we gemist!, maar je kan altijd hier een kijkje nemen)

The site for the gig - Alu Baba's
Alu Baba Temple



Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control

It starts with your family and soon it comes around to your soul





It has now become tradition that when I visit Pushkar, I shout a group of friends the cost of preparing the exquisite Rajasthani culinary delight of dahl bati. My first experience of this meal was in 1983 when my Brahmin friend Janadin (now dead) prepared it for me and a few other foreigners and locals.

Bati are balls made of flour, desi ghee, haldi, and a few other spices, kneaded and then boiled and slowly baked over smouldering cow dung before again being soaked in desi ghee. A few balls are prepared with sugar and other spices to be broken up and have more ghee added to form tumera (adding dried fruits and nuts) which is served as a sweet with the meal. Rice is prepared with the addition of pre-fried cashews and almonds and dried fruits, and dahi (curd). The dahl has a rich concoction of a lot of garlic, chilli, onion, ginger and other spices added to it
Alu Baba (right) holding court on the terrace
to produce a very fulsome flavour.

But the real experience of dahl bati is the 5 plus hours of preparation, done in a temple courtyard, inter-spersed with the preparation of masala chai and perhaps the odd chillum or two. Temples are many in the countryside outside Pushkar, so one is chosen as the site for this event. Each temple has an outside area suitable for communal cooking including pots and pans. Alu Baba's Shiva temple is a particularly beautiful setting about 10 kms from Pushkar near Aja Pal.

By the time the meal is ready, appetites are attuned with delicious anticipation, and the meal is served and consumed with great appreciation and gusto. This meal is a treat to all the senses.

To prepare for 15 people, 2.5 kilos of desi ghee (being the main expense at 350 rupees a kilo), 1 kilo of dahi, and 4 kilos of flour are purchased together with all the spices, dahl, and vegetables/nuts/fruits required. The cost is about 1,800 rupees (about Aust $30).

In my position of benefactor, I was told to just sit and relax, and I mostly did just that (between participating in a few of the
Preparing the bati mix
preparatory activities). The temple surrounds were peaceful and conducive to an almost meditative state just observing my friends as they worked away. I'd call it a very organised and precise form of chaos. Everything came together in the end.

Alu Baba appeared from time to time (we were after all using his facilities). He is 65, loved and revered by the locals, and has lived in this temple for the past 12 years and become a bit of a Pushkar celebrity for foreigners interested in his now legendary practice of only eating potatoes (and so he did not partake of our dahl bati – we cooked a pot of potatoes for him). He has been practicing this lifestyle for 35 years. Why potatoes? I don't exactly know other than it is his ascetic discipline that he understands to be part of his particular dharma. He looks pretty healthy for 65 so by all accounts, a diet of potatoes seems to agree with him. One friend has suggested that perhaps he was Irish in another life (pure conjecture - but there at least is a huge sponsorship deal with a potato chips company going begging here).

The 5 of
Laly making the bati balls
us involved in the cooking (OK – say 4, I can't say I was a great help) arrived at 1pm. The meal was ready at 6 and other friends arrived to partake. First though a plate was served to be presented as an offering to the gods. It was all done and over by 7.30 including full cleaning and packing of leftovers. Alu Baba had his place back in pristine state. We rode back to Pushkar and that other reality in the crisp winter night air.

Badami to Bidar


Gol Gumbaz
Bijapur
I was roused from sleep by the call to prayer this morning there are few things more exotic in my opinion or annoying if you are trying to sleep in. The shower doesn’t work so a wet one bath was all I could tolerate, we left Badami after another crap breakfast of tiny pieces of toast and tea and headed further north to the predominantly Islamic city of Bijapur the former seat of the Adil Shahi kings (1489 - 1682).

This crazy Indian practice of laying speed humps across the highways every bloody kilometre turned a reasonably short drive into a much longer one, but we arrived around 11.30am and stopped on the edge of the city to admire the Malik-E-Maidan or in English the Monarch of the Plain an extremely large 55 tonne canon left to rust on one of the cities external walls before looking for a decent hotel room. I then accompanied Padraic to the basement restaurant where we consumed a spicy lunch consisting of chilli and other stuff before visiting some amazing Islamic fortifications, mosques, palaces and mausoleums.

The first place we visited was the incredible Ibrahim Rouza built in 1580 by the Emperor Abdil
Malik-E-Maidan or The Monarch of the Plains
Bijapur
Shah 2 for his queen unfortunately he died first and was interred there. We then visited the graceful arches of the Bara Kaman an unfinished mausoleum followed by the interesting Jod Gumbad tombs all of which share the architectural grace common to Islamic constructs.

We then visited the 1557 Jama Majid which must have once been amazing but is now falling into disrepair and finally the richly decorated gateway known as Mihtar Mahal.

The highlight of our visit to Bijapur will be the Gol Gumbaz, a mausoleum built in 1659 which stands seven metres high and has a 38 metre dome second only to St Peters in Rome. The building is supposed to have superb acoustics so we are going there early in the morning to avoid the crowds to check this out.

Yes the Gol Gumbaz does have excellent acoustics I could hear the Russian tourists making silly noises from every direction at once. I took a few dawn photos of the tomb before returning to the hotel for breakfast. The Gol Gumbaz is such a massive building for one long dead man while millions of Indians live in hovels, go figure.

After breakfast we

Bijapur
headed to the fortified town of Bidar another Indian city dominated by Islam and the home of a supposedly excellent 15 century fort I say supposedly because it was closed for maintenance when we arrived in late afternoon and wasn’t open in the morning when we again attempted to enter.

We travelled to Bidar via the town of Gulburga another town dominated by Islam visiting some impressive tombs, the ceiling of one was decorated in mirror tiles and was an incredibly gaudy sight.

I met a little girl probably twelve or thirteen years old at the Bidar Fort who had very good English and was visiting from Hyderabad, she was with a man older than me and a number of other children when I asked her if the man was her father he answered saying she was his wife. India is a paradise for paedophiles it seems.

We have decided to visit an impact crater at a place called Lonar which is in Maharashtra state, so early the next morning we started driving, after about two hours the driver started babbling about border taxes, unfortunately at the border there was no tax office so after much stuffing

Bijapur
around we had to spend another couple of hours and many more kilometres finding one. Eventually late in the day we pulled into another nondescript ugly Indian town called Beed where we stayed in the only hotel we could find.

Hampi To Badami


Virupaksha Temple
Pattadakal World Heritage Site
India can be difficult place in which to travel, the dirt and the filth becomes depressing so I ensure that I bathe every evening no matter the water temperature. I can’t ever remember being so consistently filthy anywhere I have previously travelled.

Next morning after another poor attempt at an edible breakfast we hit the road stopping briefly to look at an interesting temple in Hospet before negotiating about three hours of bad roads before eventually stopping briefly at a dodgy looking road side diner for a surprisingly cold Sprite and to watch a few minutes of the cricket on the beat up TV in the corner.

It was then on to Aihole pronounced Ay-hol-eh where we would see some stunning 6th century temples, Padraic says we should have started here and travelled south as the temples are getting progressively older as we continue further north. The Durga Temple and the Museum were the highlights at Aihole and in particular the precinct where the temples were much simpler and more solid looking then later architectural designs.

From Aihole it was only a few kilometres to the World Heritage listed Pattadakal complex which was once a capital of the
Durga Temple
Aihole
Chalukyas empire and has temples dating back as far as the 3rd century. It was an amazing complex although it was extremely hot and dusty; I was initially in my element.

A world heritage site and only a small crowd of visitors how refreshing, until they all began following me around, I couldn’t escape them. Every time I turned around there were at least thirty people following me, Padaic thought it was hilarious, eventually I agreed to a few photos with their kids and they left me alone.

From here we headed to Badami along a rough road where we would spend the night, stopping briefly at a very old Jain Temple which had fantastic carved elephant heads on each side of the entrance. Badami is an attractive shady town located in a canyon encircled by forts and old temples decorating the cliff tops. The down also has the lovely Agastyatirtha tank with the gorgeous Bhutanatha Temple jutting out from its shore but the real attraction here are the caves.

The caves are early fifth century rock cut temples containing superb carvings of Hindu and Jain deities. I have always had a passion for rock cut cave
Gandar and Ladkhan Temples
Aihole
temples and would have enjoyed these more if not for the large crowds swarming all over the place.

There are four caves the first about ten metres up the rock cut stairs carved into the cliff, these stairs then continue to the other three caves about fifty metres further up, as I climbed up the stairs to the third cave I was surround by about forty school children all clapping and cheering me, I have no idea why, I was somewhat embarrassed and extremely confused.

After the caves I walked around the tank visiting the old temples, near the Bhutanatha Temple I was attacked (again) by Macaques and this time they weren’t intimidated, I had to go get a security guard, as they were surrounding me the little hairy bastards.

I was going to visit the museum but some kid was defecating in the entrance way so I wandered off into Badami's attractive old town, Indians shit and piss anywhere they please, while we were enjoying our breakfast this morning five little girls climbed the fence and all defecated near one of temples on Hemakuta Hill in Hampi, so much for world heritage protection.

A stunning elephant drawn carriage
Vittala Temple
The stunning city of Vijayanager is the capital of the destroyed Vijayanagara Empire is a showcase of fine medieval Indian architecture and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The city was around 26 square kilometres and was encircled by seven levels of defensive walls many of which can still be seen.

Our guest house is located within metres of the older temples on Hemakuta Hill, which we visited immediately after Virupaksha Temple, which dominates the small village and traveller enclave of Hampi Bazarre. I particularly like the older temples dating from the 9th century strewn amongst the boulder dominated terrain.

We visited a number of smaller temples many of these were dominated by large effigies of various gods including Ganesh, before striking of down a dirt track with the plan of looping back around to some of the other major sites. The scenery was extremely attractive as we followed the course of a canal identifying and photographing temples standing starkly on hill sides or buried in the undergrowth. Unfortunately we couldn’t find the path that lead to the river and the sun was setting so we had to turn around and walk all the way back. From here we grabbed
Hampi bus station
Hampi
a rickshaw and went to a village four kilometres away where we had a few beers before returning to Hampi for dinner (no booze in Hampi).

Saturday dawned hot and cloudless (when is it anything else) so we headed out to the Royal Enclosure visiting major sites such as the Queens Bath and Zenana Enclosure and the beautiful Lotus Mahal. We then checked out the brilliant Elephant Stables, The Barracks and many more ruins. There were few people about so we wandered at will for several hours, it is a shame Indians don’t value these monuments as they scrawl graffiti on everything and throw rubbish all over the place, still we saw some fantastic architectural sites in that morning.

Around 10.30am we arrived at Shiva’s Underground Temple where the driver was waiting and he showed us an ancient military dining area where a long line of plates had been carved into some rocks near an aqueduct. Before taking us to the museum where there was a large model of Vijayananagar, we were able to see how close we had come the night before to a major road. The museum was surprisingly good, we then headed to the fabulous
Virupaksha Temple
Hampi Bazaar
Vittala Temple where we the left the driver and set off on foot.

This temple was built in the 15th century and looks fantastic sandwiched between rocky ridges and the river. The highlight of this complex was the magnificent carved chariot in the courtyard. We ate a couple of ice creams to try and combat the heat before followed the beautiful Tungabadhra River back towards Hampi Bizarre. We could see many of the Anegondi Temples across the river as we stopped at a restaurant for a meal and a cold drink.

Bangalore to Kundapura
Bus trip from Bangalore to Kundapura and return. Local day trip by bus from Kundapura to Udupi, autorickshawto Malpe and by boat to St. Mary's Islands.

There is something very strange about beach destinations. I used to wonder,what do all these people do when they stay near the beach? Of course, there is the sea and you go for a dip, but the charm runs out after a couple of hours and then what next? With hill destinations, I get it. There is driving, hiking up and enjoying the view from the top. This was until the trip to Agonda in south Goa. For three days it was nothing but eat-swim-relax-sleep-drink-swim-relax routine and by the end I had attained complete nirvana. It was about rediscovering myself. For one, the vast expanse of the ocean and the power of nature puts things in perspective about the connection between us humans and nature. Second, doing nothing is actually a good way to think through things, relax and make decisions about life. It was a completely different experience for a person like me who always has to have something to think about.

Thirdly, enough with the philosophical bullshit. I'll come to the trip I took with my wife, Pavi.

I had booked a round trip non A/C sleeper bus ticket from Bangalore to Kundapura by Karnatake State Road
View of the coast from the resort
Transport Corporation KSRTC (Rupees 400/person one way). The bus that we were supposed to travel in had had a breakdown and we were bumped up to A/C semi-sleeper bus after an hour of waiting. We were pretty tired and slept as soon as the bus took off. The bus takes the popular Bangalore-Mangalore highway through Hassan and reached Mangalore the next morning. From Mangalore the bus travels northwards to Udupi, the popular temple town, and as soon as we reached Udupi, the air was waft with the smell of the sea (fish, to be precise!). The next stop would be Kundapura about 90kms from Mangalore. Kundapura is a small non-descript town but is well connected on the West coast highway. We got down at the bus stop and hired an autorickshaw (tuk-tuk) and were charged Rupees 250 to take us the 12kms to the Turtle Bay beach resort. I had made a reservation online for a small standard room (Rupees 1000/night) for two days, but when we got there we were told that the rooms were unavailable as the people staying there had extended the stay.The lady at the reception told us that they can give us a cottage room
Entrance of the resort from the beach
right next to the beach for 2000 rupees/night. The room was clean and laid artistically with typical village style windows (check out the pics) and a cement slab cot. It was neat and comfortable and with the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks on the coast, heavenly. The property's USP is the presence of rock boulders on the coast with crevices big enough for a person to walk-in and the resort is surrounded by fishing hamlets with boats neatly laid out. The fishermen take the boats out in the night for a catch and sell it in the nearby towns. A picture perfect place to relax for the weekend. We took a dip in the sea, had food and beer. The food was not quite to our taste, but the beer was heavenly as it always is near the sea.

The second day, we decided to explore the place and headed towards Udupi and Malpe. We walked the kilometre from the beach to the bus stop and took the local bus to Udupi (Rupees 30 one way). Once there, we took the autorickshaw to Malpe, 6kms from Udupi. We got a ferry ticket to St. Mary's Islands
Another view of the coast from the resort
which is about 6kms from Malpe. After a 30min wait, the boat finally arrived and boarded 50 souls to be taken to St. Mary's Islands. The islands are made of volcanic rock formation with the rock arranged neatly like a column. The island coast is madeup of shells and not sand as I had assumed. What lies beneath the coastline - rock, shells or sand, I am unsure. I gathered that the formation of the island is geographically unique and resembles the Giant's causeway in Ireland. We explored the place and took a short dip in the water as it was crowded in the weekend. The view of the island and coast from the topmost part of the island was enchanting. We then took the ferry back to Malpe and the tuk-tuk to Udupi, had a short look at the temple and the famous decorated idol of Lord Krishna. We could not see the idol as the Lord had taken time off for a shower, and so settled to shop for some beads (Pavi is crazy about beads) in the little shops that line almost every temple in India. We then took the local bus back to the resort, had
Volleyball nets outside the resort
food and drink and spent the remained of the day relaxing.

The third day was spent relaxing with usual food-drink-dip-sleep-food routine and that evening we headed back to the KSRTC depot in Kundapura to take the bus back to Bangalore. One tip that I learnt was that it is better to take a semi-sleeper bus (like the seats in an aeroplane) when traveling through hilly terrain as the position is good for sleeping. Full sleeper buses tend to rock front-to-back and can be quite merciless onthe neck.

On the whole, a very relaxing long weekend.

The slum
by Polona

After staying in Varkala for more than we intended (don't get me wrong, I am NOT complaining 😊) we finally got off our butts, packed our backpacks (again) and off we were to the train station on our way to Alappuzha or Alleppey, as they call it.

Alappuzha is one of the spots where you can do boat tours around the backwaters and discover the numerous canals. They call Alappuzha the “Indian Venice”. I guess the similarities are there – people living surrounded by water, there are no roads, all the traffic takes place on the water, but I suppose that's where it ends. Yes, Venice are smelly too, but you can hardly say the smells are the same. You would understand if you have been there 😊. You can take a whole day trip around the river canals (but it does get slightly boring after a couple of hours), people also do tours that take days, hiring houseboats (beautiful and luxurious boats, with 2 or more rooms on the boat, but trust my word when I say the luxury costs as well).

We arrived to Alleppey in the afternoon, so we decided to go round
Backwaters
town a little bit, do the backwaters the next day, and than leave for Gokarna. One thing I will definitely remember Alleppey for is The Great Battle – namely the battle between us and the really huge, humongous mosquitoes. I swear, they were huge, I have never seen mosquitoes this size. And there were gazillions of them. Jan and I just sat in front of our room, when they attacked, biting us even through our clothes. So it started, we were clapping our hands like idiots, killing as many as possible, but they had amazing back up, and it was 2 of us against an army of them. We did not falter though, and the pile of dead mosquitoes around our seats was getting bigger and bigger, but so was the number of new arrivals. So for 2 evenings straight, we were fighting for our mere existence. There was this Indian guy watching us and he said: “Mosquitoes, ha? Yeah, they come in the evening, many of them. And they like your pale skin.” And then he laughed and left, leaving me thinking I should of done a better effort of tanning my pale, white skin. 😊

The next
One of many victims
morning we went to town, as we were told it is best to look for and hire a boat by yourself than to have an agency organise your trip around the backwaters. So we found this guy, who was offering us a motor boat for a decent price, but once we got to the boat, we saw he was just the middle man. He started fighting with the boatman and Jan assumed (correctly) they were fighting about how to share the money. So Jan took our money back from the middle man and we agreed for a different price with the boat man, and off we were. It was quite nice and to be honest, observing how the people live with the water was quite interesting. They do everything but cook with the river water. So we saw many people bathing and washing, women doing the laundry...It was also very quiet, because there is no traffic there, apart from boats. Our boat man tried to give us some information about the backwaters, but after an hour or so, he kept repeating himself up to a point, when Jan and I could hardly stay serious any more. We also made a
No clue what it is?
Maybe a durian?
quick stop at his house, where his wife prepared some chai for us. But that's when the guy started acting weird, he was all cocky, asking us same questions 6 or 7 times (how long will you stay in Alleppey, where are you going after...), it was very obvious he was trying to show his wife and mother (who joined us later), how cool he was. And also, I think he took something, cause it was all gibberish coming from his mouth. So you can imagine we were more than happy when our 3 hour tour around the backwaters was over and we were able to get away from the guy.

I can't remember when I was last so happy to leave a place, but I was thrilled when we left for another overnight train to Gokarna. As there was no direct train from Alleppey to Gokarna, we had to get off at an interim station of Kumta, at 3.30 in the morning. I have to say, I am starting to love the Indian trains. You could easily live there and lack nothing. There is always food available (fresh, as they have a huge kitchen on the train), you
A closer look at it
can get chai or coffee, snacks...And everything is so cheap. If you buy anything on trains around Europe, it always seems to cost a fortune. We got the side bunk beds, which were quite comfy, so it seemed like we arrived to Kumta in no time. As it was only 3.30 am, we slept on the train station and we woke up at about 7am, ready to continue our trip to Gokarna. When we stepped out of the station, we were like “What the hell?”, the area seemed so isolated, so quiet and so far away from any life. We walked to the road and asked around for the bus station. A guy just told us to wait at the side of the road, where we were picked up by a sleeper bus, on its way to Gokarna. An hour later, we were finally there.

Following Diego's recommendation we took a tuk tuk to the Om beach (it got its name following the fact that the beach is in shape of the Indian sign for “om”). The tuk tuk dropped us on the top of the cliff, so a flight of stairs later, we were on Om beach, looking
And a bit closer
for the Dolphin bay hostel. I was so tired and soooooo in need of a long shower that I was quite taken aback when I first saw the huts behind the Dolphin bay cafe. They were the simplest huts, put directly on the sand, with a bed occupying pretty much the whole room. Wow, I totally lost my spirit, whereas Jan loved it, there was this really easy going, nice group of people sitting in the sand around a huge round table, which was placed in the middle of the walking path, a row of about 6 huts on each side. Jan joined them, whereas I was fuming, so I took some me time, and went round the beach. When I came back, I was shown how the “shower” works (there was a huge tank of water, you had to drop your stuff in the so called bathroom, grab a bucket and fetch the water from the tanker). After a “shower” (the place had no running water), I felt a bit better and I started to absorb the feel of the Dolphin bay “slum” (I don't really know who came up with the “slum” thingy, but it was so right
The great battle
– basic huts, no running water and a bunch of hobbos 😊).

The first couple of days, we felt as if the slum was colonised by the French, pretty much everyone but us were French. But everyone was really nice so we felt like home very soon. Apart from walking to town one afternoon (climbing over a hill, walking over Cudly beach and walking over yet another hill – about an hour's walk), we didn't do much. Well, that's a lie, I walked to town and back again, as I managed to ruin one of our torch lights and lose another one, so with the daily power cuts in the slum, we really needed one.

Also, as Om beach is full of “free spirits” and new age hippies, it wasn't weird to see people doing yoga on the beach early in the morning. I must admit something: I became one of them. Following the yoga course we did in Varkala, I got into a habit of doing yoga every morning (still am, here in Goa), although I am not into the whole “spiritual crap”, I just like how my body feels after a full hour's stretching and bending.
Everyday life for some


Anyhow...after 2 days, we got new arrivals to the slum, that kinda became our own, non – French “posse”. A German girl called Anna, a couple from Sweden, Jonas and Helene, and the legendary couple from Yorkshire, now pretending to be Scottish, Julie and Steven. It was our posse versus the French contingency, fighting for our spot around the slum table. We would pretty much just sit there and chat, and thanks to Julie share some life wisdoms (for example why we should never have kids, as they are pretty much a waste of time 😊). Julie was the life of our posse, I really couldn't help but like her. The discussions we had...well, repeating stuff that was said or talked about just wouldn't do it justice. So, see Julie, you ARE mentioned in our blog, and you ARE still the QUEEN. 😊 Oh, and do say “hi” to Posh and Becks for us, and organise a small gathering. We will make sure we bring Tom and Katie. 😊. And Julie, please keep practicing and follow Anna's advice 😊 by Jan

Jan and I also got in a routine when it came to food. Lunch almost always consisted
Backwaters
of the huge and yummy Nutella pancakes. Erm, my figure is still long and lean, have no fear 😊.

Another thing that became pretty routine were the rats crawling round and in our huts at night...we became so annoyed with them, and having them on our bed one night, we slept the last night with our light on.

With all the delights and the easy going life we had in Gokarna, it was yet again time to move. With sad hearts we said farewell to our posse, and again, off we were, on our way to Goa. Oh, yeah...new age hippies, here we come!😊

Mysore to Hampi


Hoysaleswara Temple
Halebid
Another short drive as we arrived in the ancient city of Mysore around midday and dumped our bags at the hotel I had booked the previous evening, it is clean and comfortable and within just a few minutes’ walk of the palace. We decided that we would go visit the further afield sights immediately then dismiss the driver as we will be staying for a few days. The first of these sights was the star shaped Kesava Temple built 1268 in Somnathpur some thirty three kilometres east of Mysore, which was totally covered in carved soapstone figures from the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita some quite pornographic. I found the temple fascinating, it's a shame the Indians don’t build anything so pretty anymore.

On the way back we visited the temple on Chamundi Hill not very interesting but the five metre carved statue of Nandi was interesting on the way down, we then went to a couple of expensive shops so the driver could get commissions, although he told us not to buy anything. The rest of the day was spent in a pub enjoying a few Kingfisher beers.

Tuesday morning I rose early as usual, my stomach
Keshava Temple
Somnathpur
is much better today although I may be getting Padraic's cold now, I have never seen anyone eat as much as him, he will eat anything and in huge quantities. I headed for the palace, I was harassed by children asking for money as I walked to the palace then by the police when I refused to check in my camera on arrival, they don’t seem to have anything useful to do, I no sooner entered the palace and the Indians are snapping everything in sight with their mobile phones. The Palace is century old and well worth a look, although it is gaudy and only a small portion is open to the public I then visited the shop where I purchased some souvenirs.

First stop this morning is Sriangapatnam a fort town built in the middle of the Cauvery River by Tipu Sultan who was killed in a war against the British in 1799, he built a summer palace in beautifully carved timber (Daria Daulat Bagh) only two kilometres from the Gumbaz (tomb) where his body is interred.

We then visited Sravanabelagola (Monk of the White Pond) a Jain pilgrimage town which is dominated by an eleven
Keshava Temple art
Somnathpur
hundred year old statue, 18 metre tall and perched on Vindhyagiri Hill, the statue was naked and his penis is about three feet long. The six hundred and fourteen steps to the top were a bit of an effort as the rock was hot and we had to go bare foot, the views were great from the top.

We then travelled to Hassan an unpleasant busy town where we stayed the night, I had to go see an Airtel vendor here to get some more credit on my phone then Padraic and I had a few beers and a meal.

The next morning we visited the Hoysala temples at Halebid and Belur, the Hoysala were the dominant Hindu empire in this part of India for a number of centuries managing to fight of the Muslims off for a number of years before eventually being defeated, they also built the Devala Temple at Somnathpur.

Of the two temples (both free entry) the Hoysaleswara (Halebid) Temple (1121) dedicated to Shiva was in my opinion the better, it was more intricately carved and the interior had bats and beautiful sculptures, there are also two large Nandi statues and a museum
Fantastic carving
Somnathpur
set in an attractive park near a lake. The Channakashava (Belur) temple dedicated to Vishnu took a century to build (1126) and is still a working temple with priests etc which is interesting, as were the other temples on the site, the tank and the well.

On the way back to Hassan we stopped at a resort for lunch and decide to stay there the night rather than return to that ugly town. I am sick again my second nasty cold since I have been in India, at least my stomach isn’t playing up today. We met our new driver Mani at the resort, the food here is great, I had a huge cooked breakfast before our departure to Hampi.

with some trepidation about landing on the hilltop in mangalore where sometime ago an air india flight had crashed, we arrived at mangalore airport, a newly built airport, collected our luggage and proceeded towards taj gateway. they offered us a choice of rooms and we were upgraded to a club room with a view of the arabian sea. we explored the hotel and discussed a day trip with travel desk. We arrived at the coffee shop and i chose a mangalore thali with the fish and chicken, my husband ordered a nasi goreng and after a little rest we left for sun and sand resort which was right on the beach. entry to the resort also came with snacks and we spent some time at the coffee shop overlooking the beach and viewed some of the rooms and then got into the water. there was a dog swimming in the sea and i must say he was such a powerful swimmer. we then left for someswara beach which was a rocky beach. we saw this beautiful sunset and returned to the hotel after a detour to see the docks.

Dinner was at the indian restaurant and we turned in early

since the next morning we were leaving for puttur to attend a wedding. we arrived in puttur and started breakfast of idli and dosa and coffee. after the muhurtam and wedding we proceeded for lunch and the food was excellent. i specially enjoyed the sweet dosa and payesam and we met the bride and groom one last time and left for mangalore. On the way back we stopped at my husbands parents house when at some point of time they used to live in mangalore.

back to the hotel we packed and left our bags at the reception and sat in the coffee shop having club sandwiches and a beer. the food was very good in the hotel. i was happy to find a gateway hotel coming up in kolkata. i also picked up a fridge magnet from the hotel shop and we left for the airport. from the airport we could see the mangalore refinery and took some photographs of it. at the airport i managed to find the hotel keys in my bag and called them and left them with the jet airways counter. a short and sweet trip to mangalore ended with biryani.

The river at Hampi
Leaving Palolem and Goa behind we began our journey to the remote and ancient ruined city of Hampi, an upsettingly long 400km drive away. Whilst driving up a hill and approaching a blind bend, a bus which had previously tried to pass us gave it another try. As the bus drivers cab just about passed ours the bus driver swung violently left and directly into us. Fortunately we managed to stop very quickly but the bus had by this point scrapped past the right hand side of our truck with some force. In the panic and shock of the situation, my first thought was that I must immediately eat the piece of chicken in my hand, I felt sure the situation could not be resolved until I had done so. As you can tell I (along with everyone else) was a bit shocked. The bus was actually in much worse shape than us, having scrapped a fair bit of metal back on the front left wheel arch whilst we only suffered a slightly bruised bumper. One of the many benefits of driving around in a mega tonne solid steel Mercedes beast is that not much on the road can damage/push us

around. No one is exactly sure what happened and why, two theories are circulating:

1. That an oncoming car heading towards the truck made him slam into us to try and move out of the way of the oncoming car

or the more popular and believed theory that

2. He hit us on purpose as we hadn’t moved out of his way and slowed down to let him past previously

Either way, he was driving like an absolute fool and putting the lives of both vehicles passengers as well as other road users at serious risk. We took photos of the accident scene to prove our innocence in case the police became involved. At first the bus driver wanted to get the police involved, but realising he was in the wrong and we had evidence to prove it he quickly decided it would be best if we all left and moved on. This suited us as the police would probably have favoured the bus driver (even with over whelming evidence against him) and would also have delayed our already long (and only recently begun) journey. Seeing as our vehicle wasn’t too badly damaged, we decided to
Mark and a big rock
carry on.

Hampi is an unusual and very beautiful place. The town and nearby area is surrounded by hills which are littered with enormous (some humungos), smooth, flintstones style red/brown granite boulders which are pilled on top of each other in seemingly gravity defying formations. Many of the huge boulders (often worrying close to homes) look like a small gust of wind could easily send them crashing down in a path of devastation and destruction. Apparently the rocky landscape was originally formed by an underwater volcano (hence the smoothness of the rocks and their impossible positioning on top of each other), over the years movement of the tectonic plates shifted the land 700m above sea level to it’s current position 400km from the coast. As the land slowly shifted upwards gravity held the rocks in their strange formations and today they remain beautifully but perilously perched on top of each other. The rocks are very similar to those seen on Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor cheese rings, I wonder if they have a similar geological story? In the middle of these rock formations are lush green paddy fields which provide a fantastic and unique contrast to the red granite boulders,
Hanuman temple
a very positive and beautiful example of human intervention in nature. Hampi village is split in two by a small picturesque river that is littered with the unusual boulders and bordered by lush green river banks. At sun set it is a very magical place to relax and watch the sun go down, especially when looking at the tall pyramid shaped Hindu temples on the other side of the river.

The following day we took a guided tour around the ancient temples and palaces of Hampi. The ruins stretch out for many miles and in it’s hey day Hampi must have been a spectacular city and indeed was the capital of the region in ancient times. The tour was interesting and the ruins at times impressive, but the real highlight was the combination of the ruins and the unique contrasting landscape of lush green paddy fields/banana plantations and baron moon like rocky landscape. This was particularly impressive from a rather pleasing view point which looked down onto the town, the main pyramid shaped temple and across the river to the other side of the town.

Other than the fantastic landscape, the one immediate thing you notice about Hampi
Hampi ruins
is the amount of hippies. Hampi must have more hippies per square metre than anywhere else on the planet. I’ve never seen a place with so many douche bag, stoned wasters. Just outside of the main village is a hippy commune where about 20 hippies live around a giant tepee where they get stoned, sing songs and generally contribute very little to anything at all. I kid you not. If you work in the dreadlock industry I would highly recommend moving to Hampi as there are a lot of white people crying out for your services here. I’m not a massive fan of hippies (as you can probably tell), for one they contribute almost nothing financially to the local community and they seem to have no political agenda (anymore), or are at least completely impotent/uninterested in progressing any form of political agenda, instead preferring to get wasted and leave their empty bottles and rubbish all over a beautiful town. Maybe I’m wrong but I always imagine the early hippies of the 60’s to have had a political agenda (albeit a little naive) and to do some actual protesting in between getting wasted. Maybe the real problem is that most modern
Mark and room buddy Peter, Hampi ruins
hippies aren’t actually hippies but wannabe idiots dressed in silly clothes who just want to get wasted and hide away from responsibility. I’ll stop there before I start to sound too much like a ‘disgusted’ Tunbridge Wells Daily Mail reader. Whilst I’m not a fan of the hippies, they do add an element of interest in Hampi, so I guess ultimately they help a little by being a tourist attraction of sorts.

On our final day in Hampi I chilled most of the day, laying outside in the shade away from the fierce day time heat. It was nice to have some down time as the tour schedule can at times be very full on. About 16.30 a few of us set off from our hotel for Hanuman temple. Hanuman temple is supposed to be the birth place of Hanuman the Hindu Monkey God. Hanuman is one of the most popular of all Hindu gods as he was instrumental in saving Lord Shiva’s wife from an evil demon (I may have my facts a little off here), Hanuman temple is as such one of the most important temples/pilgrimage sites in India. The walk from the hotel to the temple
Mark and Tour Leader Jenny Hanuman temple
passed by lush green rice paddies and crumbling ruins including a fantastic ruined aquaduct which I presume was used in the past for irrigation. The temple is perched high on a steep hill and is accessible only by 580 steps of stairs. The climb up wasn’t actually too bad as the stairs were spaced moderately and weren’t stupidly high (unlike the more challenging climb to Tiger Temple in Krabi, Thailand). The 360 view from the top over the valleys, rice paddies, rivers and ruins view cannot by described by words or captured by camera, it was truly epic and breathtakingly vast and beautiful. If it were not for some small signs of human life I could easily have believed that I was looking at a prehistoric Jurassic landscape, raptors running across the plains would not have seemed out of place. I’ve seen many great views but I think this easily comes in my top 3, I advise everyone to go, especially at sunset.

Next stop the Jungle....

The Palace of the Winds
Accommodation - Alsisar Haveli Heritage Hotel

Weather - Warm, sunny, blue sky with haze 26C

Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, was built in 1727 by the Rajput ruler, Jal Singh, and is known as the Pink City due to the pink/terracota-coloured walls of buildings throughout the old city.

In the morning we visited the magnificent Amber Fort, the site of the ancient Rajput capital which displays Mughal-style architecture with traditional Rajput influences. What a surprise, the best kept secret of the tour so far, our transportation along the path to the fort was on Shakima, an Indian elephant!! Feeling like (but not looking like) Maharaja & Maharani we entered the inner courtyard through the majestic Sun Gate atop our noble beast.

The Amber Fort was the best fort so far, protected by massive ramparts following the highest contours of the surrounding hills with a total length of 7km, the central fort consists of courtyards, gateways, halls and temples. The Sheesh Mahal magnificent in glittering light from the reflections of thousands of small mirrors and coloured glass inlaid within the walls. The Ganesh Pol a shimmering three-storeyed gateway, decorated extravagantly with mosaics, paintings and sculptures is awe-inspiring and
Amber Fort
leads through to the inner, third courtyard of the private apartments of the Maharaja. Leaving the fort to return to the tour coach is in a jeep - somewhat less exotic than our arrival at the fort!!

A tour of the city took us passed the Palace of the Winds, a tall high facade in front of the palace complex which is still the home of the Maharaja. Next stop was Sawai Jal Singh'a Jantar Mantar Observatory, an extensive collection of large astronomical constructions to calculate the time, eclipses and astrological signs by shadows cast by the sun - the time was correct when the sun was shining but of no use when cloudy or at night!!

A timer-click!
With another episode from my Bangalore Diaries. This was my friend Kunche Swamy’s plan to go for a day out & he convinced some of his friends go for a mini-trekking and nature camp in Bheemeshwari. We set off early in the morning and hired Chevrolet Tavera for the same. It was enough for us as we were six guys in the team.

Bheemeshwari Camp is around 100 km outside the city of Bangalore. On the way, may be after an hour we had light breakfast and hot tea. Swamy was as usual excited about photo-shoot as long as any device captures his poses, and we clicked few standing in front of mountainous terrain. We were in the SUV more than 3 hours, When we were about to reach we had gone through a mini forest which was a pleasant breathing experience for us inside SUV. I was capturing some videos with my DigiCam while we all were belting jokes.

Once we reached, There were many boards with information and direction as it was a tourist spot and there were different camps as well. The landscape appears green as far as the eye can go, it is also armature
Action fun on Hammocks
trekker’s delight. Blessed with lush greenery and the placid waters of the River Cauvery, the scenic place offers ample opportunities for nature walks and sightseeing, and some adventure activities as well. First of all, you get lot of opportunity to spend some wonderful and fun moments with your friends through activities which involves some exercises with ropes. You can indulge in a number of action packed adventurous activities to make the most of your trip. Some of the fun filled activities organized by Thrillophilia in Bheemeshwari and Muthathi include nature camps, cycling and rope activities.

After much fun, we took rest lying on the hammocks beside the river, then we decided to start our trek. I stayed ahead of the rest of the pack most of the trek to capture some pics of our team in action. We got to see some other team of girls and guys who were going with a guide on trek. We just followed them as we don’t have much time to enjoy the thrill of being misdirected. I think we also paid him some money.

The terrain was gentle and strewn with rocks but slopes slightly at places which lures in a lot of trekking enthusiast towards
Trek started.
Bheemeshwari trekking. It would be good to carry some snacks and water while you enjoy the trek. Trekking is an ideal activity for a team outing in Bheemeshwari. While on one hand the picturesque surroundings provide relief to your tired body and soul. The trek along the River Cauvery is an enjoyable experience. Bheemeshwari trekking trails are frequented by many amateur and seasoned trekkers throughout the year. The pleasant weather and the beautiful ambience provide the perfect atmosphere for a trek. In general this trek is quite easy.

We had to cross a small quarry to reach the wide trek path which seemed well used and surrounded both sides with generous spread of trees. We came across new and old trees, After sometime , path became narrow and then we reached a small hill with bit of steep grassy climb to follow. Less than one hour's climb (including a break for photo poses) got us to top of hill where there was a high watch tower. Just trees and hills all around us with river flowing to our right. Few patches of red sand showed up and we tried to estimate where we had started from.

Once on top, The scene that
Trek in progrss
I saw was more or less similar with what I had expected it to be, Despite having been to western ghats and born and brought-up in a place (Kerala) where these kind of scenes are very much common, I felt every place has its own unique ways of appearance. My fellow trekkers seems to be overwhelmed by it. Indeed it looked straight out of big screen movie, the beautiful river Cauvery in the middle of the beautiful green hills, and the ideal backdrop for a brilliant weekend.

Descent was more of grassy landscape, some more dead and new trees and some thorny ones too. It got humid by then as well. Another 15 minutes and we were at rocky shores of Cauvery. We dipped our feet for some well-earned rest and spent lot of time playing by crossing stones set in water and reaching some far ones inside flowing water.

In less than an hour, we reached back the camp. After waiting besides the river on useful benches, we had our lunch - it was very simple but simply too fulfilling for our hunger. Normally if you travel across Karnataka, you get similar food which neither has

too much of sweet nor too spicy items included, In general people of Karnataka are not very fond of fishes in their daily food unlike keralites or Bengalis. Nevertheless to say we had our stomach full. Everyone wanted to laze around for a while so it was back to the hammocks for everyone.

Once we let the food settle it we were off for some white water rafting, so we grabbed our boats and paddles and pink colored life jackets. After a brief session with our guide about the techniques we were all in the water. I was not a complete swimmer, and some in the group did not know swimming at all. So being in the water was a little daunting as we heard underwater flow is more in that river. We were having a great time. When we finished the stretch we were picked up by the jeep waiting at the other end which took us back to the spot. In that open jeep I met one European who just joined Infosys Bangalore then as a part of their academic internship. I took some of his pic and mailed those to him as per his request.
"" Safety doesn't happen by accident ""

Around 5:00pm, we left the camp and continued to Bangalore. I have heard Bheemeshwari Camp also offers overnight packages. You may choose to stay in the make shift tented- cottages or the log-huts and enjoy activities such as Fishing, white water rafting, kayaking, snorkeling etc. For anyone interested in adventure, this is one holiday spot which is not too heavy on your pocket. It’s an endeavor of the Karnataka tourism department to popularize Eco tourism by preserving the rich abundant gifts of nature.

All in all it was a good timeout. If you want to make it lot better, Communicate with respective officials in advance, KSTDC has already done with website and contact details !

Roadside outside Mysore
Drinking tea, slow start to the day
Our wake-up call was at 5:30 this morning, departure at 6:30 to allow enough time to get to Bangalore(now Bengaluru) in three hours, and through the city in two hours, to arrive at the airport for our 13:05 flight.

Just after dawn was an interesting time to see rural India, albeit on a Sunday (no school, most businesses closed).Many bullock carts were being taken “where?” for the day.These have hardly changed in history, except now they use pneumatic tires.The cart is wooden, perhaps 4 feet square, a few a bit longer.Each is pulled by two thin bullocks, some still with decorated horns following the spring festival and Republic Day.The sun rose very orange in the sky, a sign of the terrible air pollution.(I have been wearing my cotton handkerchief over my nose and mouth in the bus to mitigate my allergic reaction.)

Because we didn’t stop for photos, and the bus was driving quite fast (60 – 70 kph) on the relatively new road, I used the Greek memory system to keep mental notes.


• 1. All through the dawn light, people along the roadside villages had smoky fires lit for cooking.
• 2. We passed a man herding about a
Roadside
Early purchases
dozen pigs of various sizes along the side of the road. Ahead by about twenty-five feet was a large, determined, spotted brown white pig, presumably the leader.
• 3. Many bullock cards.
• 4. Paddy rice fields were being harvested, by about ten workers in one place.In many places we saw tents pitched on the sides of the fields and people obviously rising for the day.JK informed us that these were owners protecting the harvest from thieves.
• 5. For the first time we are driving on a multi-lane highway with vehicles passing in the more conventional way, although even then some motorbikes and smaller cars insisted on passing the passers.About half of the motorcycle drivers wear helmets, although we saw one with it slung over his wrist.Virtually none of the passengers wear helmets.Most passengers are women (wives) in saris, sitting sidesaddle on the pillion seat.Quite often one or two children are in between the parents. Once I saw a man cradling his sleeping child as he drove with one hand.(At home, on a BBC program, a commentator stated that these are the potential customers for the Nano car. Affordable and a big step up for them.)
• 6. Best sight was what I might

have called a series of hovels – mean, dark, one-storey cement houses – except every single one had a rusty satellite dish!TV continues to be the great distractor, storyteller and cultural bridge, which I learned from a poor family where I tutored in Montreal.
• 7. Bangalore revealed itself with lots and lots of small, brightly painted, new apartment blocks and business places.A modern, hustling place.As we moved through the modern part of the city, we saw it to be relatively clean and definitely vibrant.
• 8. An Air Force base of large proportions (maybe all air forces bases are large) was strung along the highway we took – a sort of ring-road.Different “campuses” had their own gates and guards.


Bengaluru Airport is very new and prides (proclaims) itself as ecological.Parks and a marsh water treatment area make the approach to the soaring terminal welcoming.Inside it is thoroughly modern.Security had lines for women and for men, because they frisk every person to some degree.

We arrived an hour early because of the light Sunday traffic, and the plane was an hour late.L___ gave up on the arrangement for lunch on the plane and bought us sandwiches and brownies.My sandwich
Bangalore
Endless apartments for techies, the ""industry"" of Bangalore
was delicious: chicken tikka lightly spiced on a substantial white bread.The brownies were huge – we should have shared – but really good.

At last in Goa, we had an hour’s drive to our Taj Holiday Village resort.The roads here were even newer than in Kerala, and not at all bumpy.The resort consists of small fourplexes scattered over an expansive park; I am upstairs and share a balcony with JK, whom I saw only once.A large palm tree spreads in front of the balcony, and below are purple, pink and white bougainvillea.I was tired, so had tea and took a nap.After which I wandered down to the ocean before it got too dark.The sun was setting as a huge orange ball into the sea.The waves were strong (red flag), the breeze was cooling, and the pale sand powdery.

January 28th 2012
Published: January 28th 2012


Hej igen! 😊

Endelig fik jeg bevaeget min numse vaek fra stranden. 3 uger i det fantastiske Goa, en uge mere end forventet. Det sted er farligt! Man bliver fanget i dets skoenhed.

Derudover havde jeg noget lidt skroebeligt helbred i nogle dage, saa jeg blev ved med at booke en togbillet og saa ikke bruge den. Men det lykkedes til sidst, og nu befinder jeg mig i en af de smukkeste byer jeg nogensinde har oplevet.

Vi ankom igaar efter en syv timers togtur fra Goa, oestpaa til Hospet, og derfra en tuctuc tur paa 20 minutter til Hampi. Togturen var ret fantastisk og smuk, rejsende paa sleepers class - et trin over generalclass, hvor alle bare sidder paa skoedet af hinanden. Vi havde en slags seng og masser af plads, pengene vaerd naar vi snakker 7 timer.
Alt i alt en rigtig god oplevelse, min foerste tur i tog her i Indien, men klart den rejsemetode jeg vil foretraekke her. Natbusserne er ofte i voldsomt daarlig stand, og chauffoererne har ofte ikke sovet, eller ogsaa er de smaasnalrede. Saa togturen af dog at foretraekke, selvom man deler gulv med rotterne og er noedt til at skubbe folk vaek fra ens saede naar de ser en chance til at snubbe det. En del af charmen!

Desuden har man udsigten! Vores togtur var fra klokken 8 om morgenen til 3 om eftermiddagen, og vi saa derfor solen staa op over markerne, koerte forbi store soeer med bjergene i baggrunden, reflekteret i det blanke vand.. Vandfald, landsbyer, rismarker, maend der saelger chai og samosas alle vegne.



Eftersom jeg kom direkte fra lufthavnen til Goa uden overhovedet at kigge ud af vinduet i Mumbai havde jeg ikke en ordentlig fornemmelse af landet foer jeg kom afsted paa toget og ankom her i Hampi. Jeg var derfor stadig ikke sikker paa hvad der ventede mig, maaske var jeg slet ikke klar til Indien, maaske ville jeg vaere alt for overrumplet, maaske ville jeg bare have lyst til at tage hjem eller forblive i det trygge, vestlige Goa?

Men heldigvis kan jeg nu sige at jeg elsker det her! Jeg er forelsket i farverne, lugtene, menneskerne, lydene, alting.

Vi saa ikke meget igaar, vi ankom om eftermiddagen og efter en masse haggling fik vi en tuctuc for 10 kroner til Hampi, der tog os ned til floden. Vi havde nemlig hoert en masse godt om den anden side af floden, hvor der skulle vaere nogle ruiner - og endte med at betale 20 kroner for en lille hytte der ikke var ren, saa det flygtede vi fra her til morgen til fordel for et vaerelse med toilet. Sikke luksusdyr.

Vi vidste ikke rigtig noget om hvad Hampi var foer vi kom her, eller hvorfor saa mange andre rejsende siger at her er saa smukt.

Det fandt vi nu hurtigt ud af. Hampi er et fantastisk sted, det var hovedstaden af det aeldgamle Hindu rige, Vijayanagara. Her er stoppet med Hindu templer og ruiner, bjerge, klipper og oerkenlandskaber. Rismarkerne er groenne nu, og den groenne farve er simpelthen ulig noget andet jeg har set i naturen foer. I skoen konstrast til den stoevede brune farve som klipperne og bjergene har i baggrunden.

Vi gik en tur i byen idag, og drejede bare lige til hoejre en enkelt gang og endte op i et klippe landskab med ruiner, fungerende templer, en bananplantage for neden af klippen og aber loebende rundt.

Hele byen her er en stor ruin, og kaempemaessige sten ligger spredt over det hele. Ej men det er naesten for meget til at beskrive ordentligt med ord, og mit kamera er selvfoelgelig loebet toer for batteri saa jeg kan ikke overfoere nogle lige nu, men imorgen skulle de gerne komme.



Vi har taenkt os at leje cykler imorgen og cykle rundt til templerne i naerheden, hvilket nok skal blive spaendende. Jeg er jo vant til cykelstier i Koebenhavn... Hm.



Vi bliver her et par dage, og fortsaetter saa sydpaa igennem midten af landet til bjergstationer med teplantager, byer med Tamil musik og vandfald. Ih! Jeg kan naesten ikke vente.

Billeder foelger! 😊



Jeg skal afsted og spise karry nu, selvom jeg kunne beskrive og fortaelle i timevis mere. Det vil jeg spare jer for! Chiao

Blessings
Mine is deteriorating slowly in my sewing room.
This morning we drove into the Chamundi Hills, just outside of Mysore, to a large temple complex. Lots of people were coming to worship and there was a long line-up to go into the main shrine. We contented ourselves with marveling at the tall, carved tower, cream in colour. L__ paid for our blessings, this time a twisted cotton string dyed orange and yellow. The seller expertly tied the string around our left wrist and pressed red paste on our third eye. The string is to be allowed to disintegrate and return to the earth, as we all must. Or, we found around on the other side, believers can hang the string on the sacred mango tree, where it will disintegrate with all the others. When we left the temple complex, we discovered a large nandi statue adorned with flowers in worship. Also, here was a seller of tiny statues as souvenirs, suitable for my wants. I bought a dancing Natarajafor J__ and for me.

Next we drove to the Palace of Mysore, a doubled-in-size replacement for the original wood (rosewood and teak) palace that burned to the ground in 1897. This one was finished in 1912 – a fabulous piece of history for
Chamundeshwari temple
Awe inspiring size and decor
the people of Mysore.

No cameras were allowed inside. First we walked down an exhibition corridor that showed marble dolls, gifts from dignitaries, two stuffed elephant heads (that hardly looked real), and the Maharaja’s golden elephant howdah, among other things. The howdah is still used in a ten-day festival in October, but Parvati rides in it now, not the descendant of the Maharaja. (His family lives in a private wing.) Many of the teak doors are beautifully carved with detailed rosettes. And, the ceremonial entrance is guarded by ornate brass elephant-decorated gates that line up with the ceremonial gate on the street. (We entered by the east gate, which has a clear view to the west gate across the compound in front of the palace.)

The greatest room was the large durbar room where the Maharaja met with officials. Possibly more than fifty feet square, great fluted pillars painted peacock blue supported a stained glass domed ceiling. Every surface was either intricately painted or carved. The floor tiles were from England and wall tiles were Meissen. The building is Indo-Persian architecture with 30%!o(MISSING)f the materials from abroad. Stairs were Italian marble. Further on was a private durbar room, that probably could

From the Rose Garden, a stunning view of the great building
seat sixty people in comfort, also highly decorated.

The full public durbar room was a gigantic covered room, open fully on one side facing the main (north) gate. An extension was made in the 1930s to seat possibly a hundred more officials. Here the Maharaja heard complaints or petitions. How anyone could see him in a site of such gigantic proportions was not obvious.

Allowed fifteen minutes for photography outside the Palace, I pursued the ferocious tiger statues. These reminded me of Sharpe’s Tiger by Bernard Cornwell; the statues were designed by an Englishman (Robert Williams Colton of the Royal Academy of Arts, London in 1909, Google tells me.). The “street photographer” of the Palace offered to take our group photo for 50 rupees each, and he knew exactly how to position everyone to get the best of our persons and of the Palace into the photo.

From here we drive to Srirangapatna, heart of Sharpe’s Tiger (anglicized to Seringapatam during the British Raj). As stated by Cornwell in the afterworld of his novel, the place is a complete ruin. We drove onto the island, almost all of which is encircled by the wall broken by the historic

bombardment and now deteriorated by time. A town thrives in the Palace grounds, as it did in the late eighteenth century. The Water Gate, through which the British entered, is identified by a sign, as is the supposed place where the Tipu Sultan was killed in battle. Some of the corner ramparts, so dangerous to the novel’s characters, can still be seen; the Palace itself is only recognizable by the modern guides. They didn’t even stop the bus. Of course, Cornwell’s novel is from the British point of view: they demolished a savage enemy, who had won three previous battles aided by the perfidious French. The Indians naturally regard the Tipu Sultan as a hero betrayed by his Prime Minister who informed the British about how to enter the Fort; Cornwell portrays him as a Hindu patriot.

We then drove for about ten minutes to the Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace, unaffected by the wars and lately restored. V__ identified this as a masterpiece of India art, unmixed with European art. The veranda walls were covered in large murals with stylized depictions of the three victorious battles. The traitorous official’s face was scratched out at the time of the fourth battle.
Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace
Large public park now, with the Palace in the distance shrouded in green blinds.
The high ceilings were all painted with primitive rosettes. Blinds have been added to the veranda’s edge to preserve the paintings because the vegetable dyes deteriorate in the sun’s glare and the rain; unfortunately, the green blinds disguise the appearance of the building itself. The interior rooms are painted with intricate designs, and on the walls hang many sketches of life done by British “house” artists whose job it was to make pictorial records, as photographers do now. The last veranda wall was covered by stylized portraits of officials of the Sultanate and the Hindu princesses. (The Mogul wives were in seclusion, of course.)

Outside we admired the garden and used the toilets. These were clean, of the squat variety. An attendant carefully placed the broken-off door of my cubicle in front of me and responded to my knock when done.

After lunch was an organized shopping expedition. The first shop had shawls, fabric, jewels and rugs of the highest quality, but none of us wanted such beautiful things. The next shop was a honey-trap for me: the government shop with fixed prices at a large fabric counter. By this time, I wanted to buy some cotton to

supplement my curtain project. They didn’t have suitable cotton for this, but they had beautiful linen fabric in acceptable colours ($31.84). (When I compared them to the silk saris later, the orange was almost an exact match, but the dark red was not quite purple enough – still it will work.) As I was asking for cotton they pulled out a fabulous dark red slub cotton that looked like silk. I couldn’t let it go, so bought enough to make new cushion covers ($41.88). For all the fabrics, I bought what I hope is way too much. The third store was a charming craft shop, but my buying fervor was over.

After a rest and swim, we all met in the roof top garden gazebo for wine in the dark, enjoyable except for the permanent fug of burnt something in the Indian air. (No one is bothered much except me.) To our delight, for a relatively brief time, the Palace was lit, and we could see it clearly. A romantic end to a romantic day.

Ooty
Town of Ooty from the rise of the Government Rose Garden.
Before leaving Ooty we visited two gardens – the climate is especially good here for gardens. The Government Rose Garden is built into the side of a cliff, so that we entered at the top and discovered more paths and beds as we descended. There were 2850 varieties of rose plants, with only a small proportion still in bloom. Some were red or pink, most were white; the most unusual to me was a large lavender rose. The Botanical Gardens were mostly green – trees from many countries. Near to the greenhouse with the cultivated flowers sat a group of women sorting some sort of frond-like branches to be used to cover plants at night in the cold. We also visited a nearby tea factory to buy Nilgiri tea, a highly prized tea. Cheap at the factory: 100 rupees for 226 grams of green tea. Without a lot of time, we took the taste on faith and bought tea.

Then we settled down for a serious drive – four hours until lunch. Our route was down “the other side” of the mountain: much less rugged, precipitous, and rough. Better road and less traffic. More farms and larger villages.

Close to lunchtime, we entered
Wildlife Park
Frisky elephants paid no attention to us!
a national wildlife reserve. To our joy we saw two elephants at a watery place, getting into a mating mood. Great photos, until the park police chastised us for stopping our vehicle. Saw one and then several “Barking Deer” and lots of monkeys.

Lunch was thin. L___ disapproved of the buffet because the dishes were lukewarm and could have been sitting outdoors for any amount of time. So most of us ate the hot, delicious chapattis and drank a glass of beer. Actually I wasn’t very hungry after a large breakfast and my share of chips on the bus.

Less than the planned two more hours, we were at our Mysore Hotel, Fortune Park JP Palace. For the first time there were computers for guests, so I emailed Meena in the hopes we might meet in Mumbai. Swim. Then our third birthday dinner, for J__. (The second was for T__ on January 19.)

We left Varkala and started our 26 hour train journey in the morning. It wasn't bad at all. The landscape was amazing and we had really nice people around our seats. The train got busy at times but I often had my lower birth to myself. Ant spent most of the time sitting at the open door enjoying the landscape. We arrived in Guntakal, Karnataka at 10.30am the next day, earlier than expected which was a bit of a surprise to us. We decided to treat ourselves to a taxi to Hampi rather than having to wait 4 hours and then boarding another train for 3 hours. The 3 hours taxi ride was worse than the 26 hours on the train. The roads are awful here - some are paved but not very well, they have big potholes and loads of bumps. In addition to this our driver must have tried to save petrol and his top speed was 70kmh but most of the time we drove at 45-50kmh (yawn).

We eventually arrived in Hampi in the afternoon. What an amazing place. We heard a lot about it and we are very happy that we decided to come here. Hampi
CIMG0334
is a world heritage site and there are ruins scattered all around Hampi and the surrounding area. You can get around them by walking, cycling, rickshaw or on a motorobike. We hired a bike for a fews days and explored the area. We also walked around the ruins in Hampi itself which are pretty amazing.

As Ant is with me I don't get hassled too much but when I am on my own it's worse. He was sick one day and I walked around the ruins by myself. It was over lunchtime so not many people were around then because of the heat. This local guy came from nowhere and approached me. It's just harmles chit-chat but he then wanted to show me something at this temple and was going on and on about the kamasutra including detailed descriptions. I declined in a polite manner and went the opposite way. Mostly people just want to talk to you - they ask where you from and what your name is. Most of the kids just want sweats or pens. We bought loads of pens but they only lasted us for 30 mins because we stopped at a village and once
CIMG0353
we started giving them out we got mopped.

The place is very chilled and relaxed and we met loads of nice people here. We moved to a different guesthouse in a more quiet location overlooking a banana plantation and with nice views accross the river. We have access to a lovely spot on the river by cutting through the banana plantation (and jumping over a very dirty stream) and Ant spends some time fishing down there.

He was told to use bananas for fishing and we bought some yesterday. On the way home he got surrounded by cows who tried to eat the bananas. Once we got rid of them it was the kids and after that he got attacked by monkeys. He only managed to save 4 out of 12 bananas.

The place is full here with animals, cows, cats, dogs, sheep, goats and even krokodiles in the river - we haven't seen the latter. This morning this cow followed me through the gate to our gueshouse. The other day one swam across the river and walked out the other end like it's the most normal thing for a cow to do.

We are taking it easy today (for once) but we will go to the slothbear sanctuary 15km away and I will learn how to ride a bike, hurrah!

We are planning to leave here in 4 days which means we spent a total of 10 days in Hampi. I never thought I could stay this long in a place without a beach! Amazing. After here we are probably heading to Kanha for some tiger spotting and then Varanasi.

Sunny, hot and dusty greetings from Hampi!

Come back here
Bannerghatta
It’s a cool morning and there is a light fog covering the ground, after breakfast we were cleaning our teeth when the monkeys took up residence outside our front door, I went out to move them along when the male attacked me and I had nothing but a mouth full of tooth paste so I spat it at him, he was momentarily surprised but then he charged at me again, I stood my ground and he backed off.

It is painting day at the sanctuary today but Ruth and I are collating medical files for the bears, we have to record all the details of inoculation history, weight, when they were last wormed etc, it took most of the morning to complete the files we were given. The lads turned up about this time with a magnificent Speckled Cobra and no sooner had they removed it from the bag then it puffed up its hood, we all took a few steps back while madly taking photos. The guy controlling the snake couldn’t get it back in the bag so he enlisted Nadi to hold it, and she was almost bitten. Emma was screaming at everyone to get back as another
My first wild cobra
Bannerghatta
guy from the Agra Sanctuary came forward and he had the snake in the bag in a matter of seconds.

We returned to the camp for lunch and Emma was attacked twice by that monkey who went for me. We also have a large number of Indian men staying in the dorm behind us hopefully they will keep their noise down. We didn’t get back to the sanctuary till 3.30pm, Ruth and I are building hammocks today, I was manning the drill which was great fun and Ruth and various others were putting in the bolts we completed eight lengths by knock off time.

On the way back to the camp we saw some Gaur, Muntjacs, Sambar and Mouse deer. The Adelaide girl Joanne had her tent broken into today the monkeys stole some wet ones, lollies and had made a general mess. Ruth is not feeling the best so we stuck to our tent and tried to go to bed early, unfortunately the Indians in the dormitory were drunk and making a hell of a noise so around 11pm I had had enough and I blasted them, after that they quieted down.

The next morning we
Not a happy boy

returned to the sanctuary and Ruth and I returned to building hammocks we were much faster today and in no time we had completed sixteen bands so we went and joined the guys making the frames and assisted them in weaving the bands together and then tied the poles in place. This hammock was only big enough for one bear so we went back to work to build a larger version. Just before lunch Ruth and I went to help the keepers feed the fruit to the bears it was a good opportunity to get some video of the bears running towards us with their hair blowing in the breeze I had a great time in the back of the Ute while Ruth played with spiders inside. After lunch we continued building hammocks while others worked on various tasks until late in the day when the bears were released back into their enclosure to play on the new equipment and to squabble over treat balls. It was wonderful to see them so enjoying the fruits of our labours

Our last day at the sanctuary involved more work on the big hammock which we have finally completed; we then joined

the girls to help complete the frame and ladders. The rest of the morning was spent pulling broken parts off another platform in an enclosure that was undergoing renovation before going crazy buying bear shirts and various other souvenirs to help the charity.

It was soon time to return to the camp for a presentation from the Park CEO Dr Raju. When we arrived the camp was crawling with screaming children, running, fighting, arguing and playing cricket there would be no more peace her for us tonight. After another boring Indian lunch we all moved to the conference room where we were issued the questions that the dignitary wanted us to ask him and then the farce began, he talked about how important he was, answered our questions poorly and accepted his gift and that was that, our last day and we had waste two hours of it on that git.

We returned to the sanctuary after 4pm and went to see Bobby who was too busy eating to amble over so, we went up on the roof to watch some other bears clambering on the new platforms. At 5.30pm we returned to the camp spotting a wild

elephant and its calf on a hillside, it was amazing, we had been looking for elephant’s everyday and to finally see them in our last few minutes in the park was wonderful.

On returning to the camp we said our farewells to the vets and the Indian staff before trying our best to relax despite the hundred or so screaming children all around us.

Bangalore to Bannerghatta


What a beautiful bear
Bannerghatta
After ten hours sleep in a comfortable bed I awoke feeling refreshed a good hour before breakfast, both Ruth and I are starving as we had not eaten since 3pm yesterday. Again I enjoyed the buffet breakfast eating a fair bit of the western foods but I also tried all the Indian selections as well although I wasn’t overly impressed by any of them, the omelette rocked though. I then went to the gym for a work out, the equipment was not the best but I made do, the treadmill belt was loose and particularly dangerous. I then returned to our room for a shower and to pack my bag, Emma Gatehouse the Free the Bears coordinator would be arriving at 11am to pick us up.

When 11am came we met Joanne another volunteer from South Australia who was also staying at our hotel and three English ladies, I lugged our packs out to the vehicles parked in the street and we headed off to another hotel to pick up another Australian couple from Sydney. Bannerghatta is only about twenty five kilometres south of Bangalore but the traffic in India is incredibly dense so it took quite some time to
One of the camp chital deer

get to the super market on the edge of the city, still being new to India even the traffic jams are exotic and interesting.

It was difficult at the shop, we didn’t really know what our circumstances would be, in Cambodia we knew we had a fridge and that we could get certain things in the local village, here we had no idea, so we settled for crisps, biscuits, juice, cereal and long life milk, but it still took much longer than it should have to complete such a simple task. From here the scenery was not very pleasant the roads were lined with garbage; people here do not seem to understand the consequences of their actions or have any kind of social conscience where pollution is concerned.

Eventually we pulled up at the entrance to Bannerghatta National Park and were both surprised to see the amount of filth littering the area and the huge mass of humanity surging this way and that. There was even a “crusty” old Ferris wheel as Ruth described it in nearby paddock. Here we transferred to a creaky old bus for the trip deeper into the park to our accommodation at the

Bannerghatta
Jungle Lodge, a walled tented community consisting of eight tents with attached ensuites; we were privileged to get the one with a mural on the back wall. We found a number of species of animals and birds at the campsite including Chital (Spotted) Deer, Squirrels and Long Tailed Rhesus Macaque who are already looking for ways into the tents, I sat happily snapping shots on our porch until we went to lunch.

We met Kartik one of the driving forces behind Wildlife SOS India after lunch, he is an amazing man who has a habit of putting himself in harm’s way to prevent the poaching of Indian wildlife and to stop smuggling rings. Kartik had a Russell Viper in a coke bottle in his backpack which he had rescued from somewhere and was planning to release in the Park; this species of snake is very pretty with a figure eight marking on its body but also extremely venomous. Still Kartik didn’t hesitate to extract it so we could have an unimpeded look.

Another volunteer arrived during lunch this one from Victoria, she is not very likable, she believes she is a genius and has an inflated opinion of
Comfortable are we?
Bannerghatta
herself, where as the English girls who I wasn’t overly fond of in the beginning grew on me overtime she never did, I liked the three volunteers from Sydney as well and in particular the couple in their forties and of course the Adelaide girl. After dinner we went to the games room where we watched a documentary on the plight of the wild Tiger in India, it was terribly depressing.

The rest of the evening we just relaxed before going to dinner at 8.30pm, dinner is a variety of Indian dishes which I stoically ate and continued to do so for the week that I was there and later on my travels as there was often no alternative.

The next morning we rose at 6am to the roar of the lions in the distance and monkeys on our porch, we didn’t realise the hot water system was off so it was cold invigorating showers this morning. Our fellow volunteers were complaining about the cold night, I suppose we would also have felt the cold if we had left our tent flaps open all night as they did. Breakfast was great toast, eggs, cereal and some Indian selections
Kartik talks to the volunteers
Bannerghatta
if only the English didn’t complain so much about the cold.

After breakfast we went to the conference room for our induction and information session regarding the history of the Sloth Bear program and how Wildlife SOS India had managed to remove all the dancing bears from Indian roadsides it was an amazing story. We then piled into vehicles for the bumpy ride out to the sanctuary and a guided tour of the facility lead by Doctor Arun , vet and sanctuary manager who showed us the surgery, enclosures and the kitchen before introducing us to some of the bears.

It was great to see the bears looking so healthy after many years of abuse and to see such large enclosures fading back into the scrubby forest, we have already found a favourite his name is Bobby and he seems to have taken a real liking to us as well, he runs over whenever he sees us and tries to climb up out of the concrete moat. After visiting the three adorable cubs we piled into the old bus and visited the wild area where we watched the bears come running from every direction as the keepers throw

Bannerghatta
fruit to them from the back of their utes, I was less than happy because I had a crap seat and couldn’t get any good photographs, still it was funny watching a half dozen bears running down the road after the vehicle.

After lunch Ruth and I went and worked in the nursery doing gardening chores unfortunately the tools they have here are either inadequate or broken so it took a long time to get anything done, I wish I had known this beforehand as I would have bought some tools in Bangalore before we arrived. I must admit though that having Bobby’s enclosure next to us was a bit of distraction I would much rather watch him play than clean up dead leaves. A few hours later we were called down to see the cubs get the treat balls that we had lugged all the way from Australia, after putting treats in the balls they were thrown to the cubs who excitedly rolled them around trying to work out how to get the treats out, we watched them play for thirty minutes or so which was a highlight of the day.

The sanctuary also has a couple
How civilised tea on the porch
Bannerghatta
of tigers, one of which has only three legs, as one was lost in a snare, he despises humans (how can anyone blame him) and we were warned not to approach his enclosure. Ruth and I saw him today and he looks magnificent, at 5pm we headed back to the camp for the evening.

I have a bit of a friendship building with the kitchen staff, they don’t really understand me or me them but we joke about the cricket when I visit in the mornings to collect the milk and in the afternoons when I come for the cold soft drinks they have stored for me in their fridge, on the way over this morning Ruth and I stopped to look at Jimmi the chital and some of the guys brought some beans out so Ruth could feed her.

When we arrived at the sanctuary we split into two groups for a litter detail to clean up the rubbish that Indian’s throw out their vehicle windows, it wasn’t as bad as it sounds the weather is lovely and the three kilometre walk was good exercise. Along the way we saw sign of wild elephant and sloth bear
Very relaxing
Bannerghatta
and spotted a large mongoose, before meeting up with the other group at the halfway point where we clambered into the back of the utilities for the trip back to the sanctuary. On arrival we were all allocated jobs, ours didn’t really materialise so Ruth and I ended up being driven around all over the place and did nothing really until late in the morning when we got to place fruit in trees and under rocks and logs for the bears to find.

When we arrived back at the sanctuary after lunch (more Indian which Ruth eats in copious amounts) we were supposed to plant trees but with all the general confusion that takes place when Indians try to do anything we just sat near Bobby’s enclosure and watched him make a nest in the dirty with backside. Nadi one of the Indian volunteers returned some twenty minutes later and then we were on our way to one of the den’s where we helped feed the bears with a concoction that looks like a chocolate milkshake in big metal pans, it is made up of eggs, bran flour and water and the bears suction it up like a vacuum
Arrival at the sanctuary
Bannerghatta
cleaner. Ruth and I finished washing all the pans then headed back to the main area as today they were going to through the treat balls to some of the adult bears.

We returned to the camp around 5pm to discover that some monkeys had ripped a hole in the side of our tent, up ended our bin and generally made a mess, fortunately we had locked up everything so no harm done and the camp staff patched up the hole. Later we watched a PowerPoint presentation of the Cambodian Sanctuary and all the great things they have accomplished since we were there in 2009 finishing the day with some smuggled in beers.

Adelaide to Bannerghatta National Park


Ruth with a bindi
Bangalore
After months of planning the day had come, we awoke early and delivered the girls to my mum’s where they will stay for a while before going to the kennel for a few weeks, when I got home Ruth had prepared a cooked breakfast for me, we then made the house ready for our absence and headed down to the bus stop.



We tend to catch the bus to the airport and get a cab back but the bus is annoyingly slow today and even though the connecting bus was waiting when we arrived. Check in at the airport was hassle free although they did an explosives test on me, the first stage of the flight to India would have been without incident except hostesses kept bringing me raw vegetable meals which were healthy but boring.



On arriving in Singapore we collected our bags and took the free bus to the budget airport which wasn’t far away, unfortunately there was nothing there to do and the early check in was closed so we put our luggage in storage and returned to the main terminal to have something to eat and visit a few shops. When
Ruth tried to calm an angry bird

we returned the budget airport was chaotic so it took some time to get checked in. When we entered the departures area some young Indian lads showed me some photos of them and Shane Warne they were beaming with pride. When we boarded our flight the staff were getting angry because the Indian passengers were bringing huge amounts of luggage onto the aircraft which couldn’t be secured in the overhead lockers so they started to chuck it off.



The plane was significantly delayed and as usual the only person on the plane who put their seat back is the one directly in front of me so I endured a horror flight with my legs wrapped around my neck. Eventually we arrived in Bangalore to further chaos, it took an eternity to get through customs, fortunately we organised a driver to pick us up and deliver us to our MG Road hotel which was quite a quick trip at 2am.



Bangalore means boiled beans not very romantic that, but then it is not going to win any beauty awards (not bad for a big Indian city though). On waking, we had our first Indian breakfast,
The Mir Lion the symbol of Singapore
Changi Airport - Singapore
all very interesting and exotic before booking a driver to do some errands around the city and to see the main sights. First I had to organise a sim card which took bloody ages as I had to have copies of my passport and I needed passport photos, so these took a while to procure, however while I was doing this our driver took my shorts to a tailor friend to stitch up my zip which was coming off. Then I went and got a haircut, after shaving my head the barber started massaging it then moved down to my back it was pleasant and great value for $2.



We then visited a couple of interesting temples the highlight being the one dedicated to Nandi the bull god, then the Lalbagh Gardens where they were holding the annual flower show. The traffic here is like nothing I have ever seen, the noise and the million almost accidents is insane, you just have got to turn off and hope for the best. After about five hours in the traffic we grabbed a quick meal and returned to our very comfortable hotel.

Asia » India » Rajasthan » Jaisalmer
September 8th 2013
Published: September 8th 2013


Jaisalmer Fort
Built in 1156, the fort is still home to 3000 people
The desert state of Rajasthan might just be the most touristy in all of India, famous for its gem scams and pesky touts, but this comes as no surprise since it contains some of the most breathtaking sights in the subcontinent. Chief among them is the 857-year-old sandstone fort in Jaisalmer, in the isolated far western corner of the state only 40 kilometers from the India-Pakistan border. In this blog, however, I’d like to stray away from history and focus on my real, on-the-ground experience of the “Golden City” and its magical fort.







The most shocking aspect of my stay in Jaisalmer, besides the mere sight of the living fort and the splendor of the ancient havelis and other crumbling structures within it, was the oppressive heat. July in Rajasthan is Asia’s version of the Death Valley. Arriving after dark, my sister Leanne, her partner Matt and I checked into an overflow building of a hotel strongly recommended by our guidebook, only to find it overpriced and the room uncomfortably small. After waking up, getting organized, and checking into a friendlier and more comfortable hotel for less than half the price, complete with private
View of the Golden City from the Fort
balconies overlooking the street below (my favorite), we quickly realized we’d already used up the only part of the day that wasn’t overbearingly hot. Even the shaded rooftop where we ate breakfast was too hot for comfort. After straying no more than a few blocks from our hotel, we quickly realized that humans are simply not meant to wander freely under sunlight this fierce. The only thing that could be done from 11am-4pm was nap under a fan in the hotel room.







Except when the power goes out. Which happens A LOT in India. I know the feeling all too well. You’ve dozed off to the monotonous, tractor-like sound of an ancient, decrepit air conditioning unit when the noise suddenly comes to a stop, and within a matter of only a few seconds, your entire body begins to sweat all at once. At that point just about the only thing that can be done is to take a shower from the dribbling tap on the wall, with water that is perhaps only a few degrees less hot than the air temperature in the room but is enough to provide a small degree of
Buried in the sand to cool off
comfort, and to guzzle bottles of cold water that your hotel sells from a small fridge behind the check-in counter, provided you purchase it before the power has been out for too long and it is still actually cold. These power blackouts can be the result of planned energy shutdown times, but more often than not they are the result of malfunctions, or entire states using more energy than their allotted amount and blocking up the entire power grid.







In fact, the largest power blackout in recorded history occurred in India while we were in Rajasthan. Over 620 million people, or 9% of the world’s population, were without power for 2-3 days. What was even more unbelievable, from our point of view, was that we hadn’t even noticed. Power outs become such a regular part of your daily routine in India that you learn to expect and cope with them as the locals do. At least you try to. The most annoying thing is the first time you lose an entire e-mail you’ve spend an hour typing out on a barely functioning computer with keys that stick or are missing. In each new
Residents of the Jaisalmer Fort
city you visit, you soon start to take note of which Internet cafes have generators and fans to get your through the blackout times when it is too hot to go outside or stay in your room. We only heard about the enormous blackout, which affected 22 states across the nation, in the news after it was over.







After napping that day, we went up to the fort. With approximately 3000 people actually living inside the Jaisalmer fort, there are several hotel options inside of it, but with garbage, water shortages, and in particular sewage disposal issues causing severe damage to the fort, backpackers are encouraged to find accommodation on the Old City streets below, most of which offer incredible views of the fort without contributing to any damage to it.







A single, sloping entrance ramp leads up to fort. The ramp is a favorite hangout for a pack of ultra aggressive and traditionally adorned female Rajasthani jewelry sellers. I recognized two of them from my first visit to Jaisalmer a few years earlier. How could I forget her face, after she had posed for what
Jewelry vendor on ramp to the fort
I'd photographed this woman in 2009 but my photos were stolen. Now I got a second chance.
I thought was one of my best portraits ever taken, with her charcoal blackened eyes, string of gems suspended from her nose to ear, and hand which shielded her face from the sun by tugging at a sparkling, rainbow-colored head scarf. Never mind that she was annoying as hell and probably posed for a hundred like photos a day, 365 days a year. My original photos from that trip had all been lost; stolen along with my computer, camera and hard drives from my Taipei City apartment after I’d returned home from that trip. The small version of the photo can be seen at the top of my travel blog from 2009:
The Psychedelic Rajasthan Experience





I wanted to reshoot that photo, and there she was, ready to pose. Her sales strategy was as annoying and effective as before; posing for photos happily and then guilting passersby into buying her cheap, junky jewelry, or following people up the ramp and irritating them so persistently that they finally threw some bills at her just to get rid of her. With Leanne with me this time, I asked her to fake an interest in the jewelry so that I could

concentrate on getting the right photo, and of course in the end I would pay for whatever she ended up actually buying.







The photo shoot didn’t work as well as I’d hoped for, though. The light wasn’t right, the woman’s smile was unnatural, and she just didn’t look quite as stunning as she had the first time. Unsatisfied as I scrolled through my photos later that evening, I asked Leanne if we could try it again the next day, and she reluctantly agreed. I got a slightly better picture of her the next day, and another of the woman’s desert-worn daughter’s face that I was even more satisfied with. In my eyes, the original photo of the woman that I had taken in 2009 represented all of Rajasthan in a single colorful yet deceiving smile. My new image of the daughter, with her hazelnut eyes that look right into you from the photo, foreshadows resilience and determination.







That night, we pondered and then decided to give Jaisalmer’s legal bhang (marijuana) shop a miss. I’d read horror stories about people tripping out on bhang, ending up in
Houses in the wall of the Jaisalmer Fort
hospitals and getting handed exorbitant medical bills. What’s more, my memory of nearly getting scammed out of all my money in Jaisalmer the first time I’d visited was still fresh in my mind. Despite the legality of the drug in this special government-approved shop, we didn’t care to bother. However, that very same night I ended up, somewhat accidentally, getting completely wasted on pharmaceuticals.







Most backpackers in India know that a variety of strong drugs that require prescriptions in most countries can easily be purchased over the counter in India for next to nothing. Having a pre-dinner drink alone in my room just before meeting up with Leanne and Matt, I went through my medicine kit to find some cough syrup for the dry throat I had, which (I can’t lie and pretend I wasn’t aware of) had a high concentration of the opiate codeine. Already buzzed from my drink, I took a hearty swig of the syrup and locked my room to go rouse Leanne and Matt.







Twenty minutes later we were sitting in a touristy outdoor restaurant, barefoot, with our feet in the sand.
Jain Temple, Jaisalmer Fort
We were the only patrons, and an entourage of well-dressed waiters brought us cold Kingfishers on trays and turned giant fans in our direction as we nibbled on complimentary spiced papadums and perused the menu. Our food arrived as quickly as we had ordered it. I still felt completely normal. I took the first bite of my dish. The flavor of the masala coated my tongue, throat, and then seemed to seep right into my brain. I had gone from zero to high in the blink of an eye. Perhaps it was just the timing, but it felt as if the spices in the food had somehow brought on the high. Calm and collected (in appearance), I leaned back in my chair, took a deep breath, and then said, “Leanne. I don’t mean to alarm you, but I am high as a kite.” Leanne and Matt were, however, alarmed. “Holy shit. Holy shit. I’m OK. Don’t worry. Holy shit. I could not stand up right now if I tried. Don’t make me stand up.”







I eased into it, but suffice to say that we didn’t stay in the restaurant for very long. The

power was out on our walk back and we could not see a thing as we tried to navigate our way back to our hotel through a network of black alleyways. Occasionally we would come upon a few cows, goats, or pot bellied pigs, which we could identify based on sounds only. I’m not sure who was more terrified on that walk: myself in that special state, or Leanne, who fears most large, domesticated mammals. Lesson learned: just because something is legal in India, does not mean you should do it without exercising extreme caution and of course, moderation.







On our final day in Jaisalmer, we went for one last wander inside the incredible fort. There is something special and unique about an ancient living building, where modern human beings nap, wash their clothing, and brush their teeth in an open-air museum. The views from any of the 99 bastions over the “Golden City” and desert beyond invoke fairy tale scenes. The touts, on the other hand, who try to eek out a living selling junk that few tourists even want, add another dimension to the experience. Getting lost in the tiny side
Cow and local resident chilling in the Jaisalmer Fort
streets that branch out from the main strip is the best part, stumbling upon women applying mendhi to each other’s hands, children playing, and horned bulls snoozing under the shadows provided by intricately carved sandstone Jain temples.







The first time I visited Jaisalmer, I had purchased an amazing hand carved silver ring that shows a dozen or so Indian gods in stunning detail from a shop that was located at the end of the Fort Palace tour. Matt wanted to buy a similar one, but instead of entering the palace, we found the ring maker’s actual shop, located in a small house connected to the outer wall of the fort and looking out over the city. The maker himself was in, and Matt was able to spend an hour chatting with him and carefully choosing his favorite one, without any of the pressures or lies that come hand-in-hand with buying anything from most street side vendors in India.







Some backpackers in India really don’t like Rajasthan or try to avoid it because it is too touristy and full of hassel. It’s not exactly the kind of
One of Jaisalmer Fort's 99 bastions
place where one can “fit in with the locals” or chill out without being bothered by anyone or anything. In my opinion, it still oozes with every quality that makes India India. Its sandy, spicy breath breathes right in your face, and it offers a different experience to every visitor every time. It can be scorching and aggressive, but it will always draw visitors, with its medieval fort where colorfully adorned smiles fight for your attention, and perhaps your pocket money, too. Go elsewhere to relax, but come here for photos worth a million dollars and a unique experience that will never be forgotten.

Cow looking for breakfast Goa
HAPPY NEW YEAR

Hope you all had a good one.

Since last time very little has happened. I spent some time over christmas and new year at a couple of beaches in Goa. It was OK but nothing special. Goa has a lot more people on package tours than elsewhere in India and because of that is alot more expensive and not very much differant than any other beach in the world. Also it dosn't really feel very Indian. To be fair though I did only go to one town and two beaches so probably didn't get a real feel for the place. I may pass back through on my way home so might give it another go then.

I had planned to go on to Hampi next but have changed my mind but I may pick it up on the way back.

From Goa I moved on to Bangalore for no other reason than it was on the way to Mysore. I was only there a day while I sorted out the move South. Picked up a moto richshaw to the bus station for which the bloke only wanted 30rps (25p) which I thought was a
Traffic island Mysore
good deal as a quick scan of the map gave me the idea it was a fair old way. As it was it only took 10 mins so out I got to find that i'd been dropped at the place where you get the bus to the Mysore bus stand and not the bus to Mysore. I did a bit of muttering and swearing to myself as i didn't really want to be trundling across Bangalore at rush hour on a local bus. But after half an hour or so finanly got my Mysore bus.

Only been in Mysore for a day but already like it more than the other places i've been so far. Big Indian city's can grind you down after a bit due to the heat, overcrowding, awful traffic and noise. But even though Mysore is a fairly larg place (pop 800,000) it feels much more relaxed. Nowhere near as much traffic as elsewhere and some of it even makes the odd attempt to comply with the rules of the road. I got all confussed this morning when a car atcually stopped at a pedestrian crossing.

Did my normal leave the guest house this morning
Mysore Market
and then get hopelessly lost in the first five minutes, but that was OK gave me a chance to get the feel for the place. I found the Devaraja market an old semi covered bazar which kept me ammused for a couple of hours. I was going to go to the Maharaja's palace this afternoon but after all the exertions of the morning a small nap was in order after which it had closed! so will do it tommorow along with some other bits and bobs.

For now i'm off for something to eat (something i've been doing alot of the last month so much for the diet) the place I'm at has mutton masala on the go which smells lovely.

Until next time hope everyone is well.

3AC
Train stations in India are very lively places. They are a mix of people coming and going from all over the country, people frantically trying to buy non-reservable tickets, and people who have set up shop on blankets, filling the station floor, waiting for trains to arrive. When we arrived at Varanasi train station, it was 36 degrees, with clothe soaking humidity. This was our first Indian rail experience, and we wandered aimlessly amongst the chaos trying to figure out when and where our train would be, when a station employee (real this time!) directed us to the ‘tourist room’. “Tourist room?!”, we thought. We tiptoed through the families spread out, sleeping on the station floor, and came to a door marked ‘tourist room’. Inside was a large air-conditioned room with leather couches, private bathroom, and a handful of other Western tourists. It seemed highly unfair that just because we were tourists we got to lounge comfortably on couches, while outside there was humidity and chaos, but oh well, what can you do! While feeling a little guilty, we waited comfortably until a tourist official told us our train arrived and directed us where to go.



We booked
Taj Mahal, Agra
a 3AC ticket, which stands for 3rd class air-conditioned. Although technically 3rd class, 3AC is miles above Sleeper class (non air conditioned) and it is luxury compared to the non-reservable chair class. In 3AC, each compartment has 3 levels of bunk beds that face across from each. There is an aisle, and then there are two more bunk beds. During the day, the middle bunk is folded up and all members sit on the bottom bunk. At night, the middle bunk is unfolded, and everyone crawls into their beds, stacked 3 high. When we first sat down for our 13-hour, overnight train ride, I went to plug in my laptop. Almost immediately, I blew the fuse, rendering our entire section without power for the remainder of the trip. I don’t think our compartment mates were overly impressed, and they spoke to each other in Hindi, clearly talking about what a Western moron I was. Ooops. The train ride itself was fantastic. It was awesome getting out of the crowded city, and being able to see the beauty of rural India. We passed through small farming communities where we saw kids playing cricket in fields while their parents worked in the
Taj Mahal, Agra
fields. We saw shepherds herding flocks of goats and cows in the expanse between villages. It was great to see this other side of India. We were served roti, dal fry, and rice for dinner at 9:30pm, which was quite good. Immediately after eating, bunks were let down, and it was bedtime. I was on the top bunk, which was a bit awkward as my feet hung out 1 foot into the aisle; people would bump into them throughout the night as they tried to pass. Lisa was under me on the middle bunk. All things considered, we both slept reasonably well; woken by the occasional raised conversation, or snoring, we arrived in Agra at 7:30am. A successful first India train trip!



Going to Agra to see the Taj Mahal is a bit like going to Pisa to see the leaning tower; aside from the main attraction there is not much else going on in the city itself. That being said, the Taj Mahal is considerably more impressive than a tower built on a crappy foundation, and it did not disappoint. Our hotel was located 250meters from the main gate of the Taj, and it had a
Taj Mahal,Agra
fantastic rooftop patio that overlooked it stunningly. We dropped our bags in our room and headed to the main gates of the Taj while the weather was still good. Although only 250meters from our door, a procession of rickshaws and tuk-tuks waited for us outside the hotel; they followed us down the road all the way to the gates, asking to drive us, as we pointed to the Taj Mahal saying, “Guys, it’s right there…seriously, we’re good”. The Taj Mahal was breathtaking, and there is no question why it is considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings ever created. We strolled through the grounds for a few hours, soaking up the views and taking a ridiculous amount of pictures. It was a 42-degree scorcher that day, and after our clothes were thoroughly drenched, we made our way back to our hotel. That evening we decided to check out the “Hotel Oberoi”, which was located right beside our hotel, and is one of the most expensive hotels in India, with rooms costing up to 5,500 Canadian per night! Just to get to the hotel entrance you have to first go through a set of security gates, past 2 more
Amber Fort, Jaipur
sets of guards, where a concierge then greets you. We just wanted to sit in the fancy bar and have a beer, but before we knew it the concierge was calling the restaurant for reservations and people were escorting us to the bar. We sat down, took a look at the price of the cheapest beer, and we realized it would cost more than both of our entire meals next door; we promptly stood and took the walk of shame past the concierge, past all of the guards, back to our budget hotel next door. We had a fleeting moment of Indian royalty, but we enjoyed our budget digs just fine.



The next morning we were up at 3:45am to catch a 5 o’clock train to Jaipur. It was an enjoyable 6-hour ride that landed us in Jaipur by 11am. We arrived at hotel Pearl Palace and were blown away by the place. The rooms were big, air-conditioned, and very clean. The bathrooms were newly renovated with fancy, hot water showers; this was a very enjoyable treat for us. There was a happening open-air restaurant on the top floor that overlooked the ancient Pearl Palace (hence the
Amber Fort, Jaipur
name). The hotel had a tandoori oven, and the place made the best Indian food that we have eaten on our trip. Amazing food.

On our first day in Jaipur we headed into the old city on foot. Jaipur is called the ‘pink city’ because all of the buildings are painted pink (oh really? Duh!) The old walled city is a maze of busy and chaotic bazaars, split into sections, each selling different products like jewelry and silk. Streets are completely packed with people, vehicles, and camels pulling carts. We walked around for a few hours before sensory overload kicked in and we headed back to our hotel sanctuary for dinner. The next day we hired a tuk-tuk and driver for the day to take us to see a number of sights outside of the city. It costs about 10 dollars Canadian to have a driver take you around for the whole day, and wait in the parking lot for you while you tour various sights. Our first, and favourite stop, was the Amer Fort. Just 11km outside the old city, Amer Fort/Palace sits high on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. We were very impressed with grandeur and
Water Palace, Jaipur
extravagance of ancient royal Indian life. Walking through the marble courtyards, looking at the various jeweled and mirrored sitting rooms, and beautiful gardens, you really get a feel for life during the time of Maharajas. 600-year-old paintings on the walls showed the parties, banquets, that once took place in the palace. It was a fantastic tour. After the Amer fort we stopped at the water palace, a beautiful palace built in the middle of the lake, where the Maharaja would escape the heat during the summer months. It wouldn’t be a “tuk-tuk tour” without our driver then taking us to a print factory, where we ushered into a room with men trying to sell us printed fabrics! We listened politely for a couple of minutes before saying we were not interested, and left. Our driver then took us to a silver factory. It was at this point that I had to call bullshit and say no more factory tours, to which he protested but agreed, and took us to our final stop at the city palace in old town Jaipur. This tour was an overpriced 300 rupees (5 Can.) each, and we were not impressed by the tour itself. The
Rooftop Restaurant, Jaipur
present day Maharaja stays in this palace when he is in Jaipur, so we could not see inside the building itself. Instead we were toured through courtyards on the outside, taken through 2 gift shops, and we viewed the armory. All in all, not great, but oh well!

That evening we met up with our friend with our friend Sung, who is a Chinese student touring SE Asia solo for the next couple of months. We met Sung in Varanasi and then ran into him while touring through Amer Fort and invited him to dinner at our hotel. We had a great evening drinking beer and eating great food. We will certainly miss the Pearl Palace, but we are eager for our next stop, Bundi!

There are always advantages to every travel situation in life, and this is never more true than when you are planning a trip to India.



Never forget that this vast country is, geographically, a sub-continent. From the snowy peaks of the Himalayas in the north, through the deserts to the west, down to the steamy heat of the south, there is a huge range of climatic zones. So whenever you plan your journey, there will always be the weather factor to be considered. Given the size of the country, there is no single ‘ideal’ time to visit India.



For example, if you wish to travel to Ladakh, high up in Kashmir, you can only do so during the hot summer months, when the snow melts in the passes, and the road and airport become, once again, accessible.



Much (but not all) of the country experiences monsoons between the months of June-September, with varying degrees of intensity, but do not for a moment let the thought of rain deter you from traveling around India.



The monsoons are, in fact, a lovely time to see the country. Just a few showers are enough to transform parched dustiness and arid baked landscapes into lush, clean greenness. Dust is washed away, as is the heat-induced weariness of people. When it rains, people smile in relief and delight, and go stand out in the street, to relish those first deliciously cooling showers.



Not only does everything look cleaner and greener, there are usually far fewer tourists, so bookings are easier, monuments are not as crowded, and so what if it rains while you are sight-seeing? You sit it out, chat to the people who will inevitably join you, and when the monsoon shower is over, off you go.



By and large Indians are not whiners. So, when it pours down, far from grumbling, they smile and enjoy the rain. You will see more smiles and laughter during the rainy season than at any other time, guaranteed.



So, travel during the rainy season and enjoy a quieter, cleaner, greener India, whilst accepting that it may, at times, be a little more chaotic than usual.





Here are a few tips to surviving the monsoons:





Make sure you have a rain cape to cover your back-pack/day-pack – though you will get hot, be warned – and if you have an umbrella for sight-seeing, so much the better. It will do double duty as a parasol and an umbrella. Most monsoons showers are just that, showers, so an umbrella often makes more sense – you are not venturing out for hours on end in the rains, remember.

Rubber flip-flops (known as chappals in India) are ideal footwear in the monsoons. You have to take shoes off so often in India – inside places of worship, often inside peoples’ homes – that flip-flops make sense, in any case. Plus, they don’t get spoiled by a sudden downpour.

You must always be careful about drinking water in India – as in never, ever drink the tap water – and you do need to be especially vigilant during the monsoons, since pipes do burst and water does overflow.

Inevitably, where there is heat and rain, you will get mosquitoes, so be vigilant about protecting yourself. Cover up in the evenings, use repellent, and don’t ever leave water stagnating around you – prime breeding ground.

If the rains are especially heavy, your timetable might well get a little altered. For example, in the hills, small landslides sometimes happen, and so the road will get blocked, and you will be delayed. There is nothing you or anyone else can do, so the only thing to do is to enjoy the rains the way the locals do.

Sit back, wait for the landslide to be cleared/the overflowing road to drain/the rain to stop, and do that quintessentially Indian monsoon thing – have a steaming hot cup of tea and a plate of pakoras, and enjoy the rain.



I hope these tips and tricks will help you during your trip to India during Monsoons.Please do not forget to visit my website www.indianheritagetours.org . Please feel to contact me for guided tours and car rentals. Happy monsoon travels!

Asia » India » Rajasthan » Udaipur
May 10th 2013
Published: May 10th 2013


A day which has earned an entry all of its own. We began the day with what shall forever more be remembered as the ‘sweat death breakfast’ on the rooftop of our guesthouse. Turns out when there is no breeze it is rather warm in Udaipur, even at 8am. If only someone had warned us it might be hot. Oh wait…After ten minutes of alternating between using the menu as fan, hat and elbow mat to prevent frying our elbows on the molten metal table we surrendered to the shade to finish our sweat droplets with muesli fruit curd-the incredibly appetising Indian term for yoghurt. We have managed to, with a combination of extensive gesturing, saying the same sentence repeatedly in increasingly louder and with varying inflections and haphazard missing out of selected words (as has become my general way of communicating), persuaded the guesthouse to allow us to set up a tab saying as we are staying here for a month. This involves signing all of our orders so they can add them up at the end of each week. So far, so normal. Until we were thrust an empty sheet and simply asked to sign the bottom. We pointed out, using the communication strategy previously described, that is not particularly common practice to sign a blank cheque for an undetermined amount. About ten minutes of stalemate later we won the battle and our actual bill was produced.

Luckily we were not in a rush as our induction meeting at our new placement was not due to start until midday. Em and I waved Han off (she is working with a different NGO in Udaipur) and set off to investigate the very promising-sounding RKay mall which is on the way to our NGO. Our dreams of regular pitstops for air conditioning and ice cream were quickly quashed as it quickly became evident that RKay’s management haven’t quite yet grasped the fundamental concept that in order for a mall to function the shops actually need to open. We tried to buy a drink to pass the time from the seemingly fully staffed and stocked food court but were staunchly informed that they were not able to open for an hour (it was by this point 11am). After some half-hearted attempts to persuade them that it might not be a bad idea to accept money from the only people in the building, we gave up and headed for the exit at which point Celine Dion began bellowing My Heart Will Go On from the rafters. Slightly bemused we hopped in a rickshaw for the short trip to Seva Mandir, the NGO we are working with this month.

Seva Mandir are a large, very well established NGO who, like Ashwini are incredibly well organised with a big emphasis on community ownership just on a much larger scale. They are based in two buidlings on the same road, have a huge library, several offices, hundreds of staff and volunteers and are carrying out interventions in rural Rajasthan ranging from education to forestry to microfinance to community forums addressing climate change. We are working with their health division and have been assigned a project to develop a training resource to teach the Traditional Birth Attendants about antenatal check-ups. We were not able to meet our supervisor until 3pm so went to attempt to get ourselves a sim card in the meantime after reassurances from our volunteer coordinator Preeti that the Vodaphone shop was the answer to all our problems. Given it was the hottest part of the day we decided that it would be a fabulous plan to walk the mile-long trip to the shop. Never knew that knee-caps could sweat. Learning new things every day on this trip. We stopped for a water refuel halfway along the route from a popular café which has become our local, mainly because if we ask what the non-specific goods are they just let us try them rather than attempting to explain. On finally completing our epic trek and confirming that the glorious site of the Vodaphone shop (complete with no less than 4 air conditioning units) was in fact real and not a heat-induced mirage we were informed that though we would definitely be able to get a sim-card (progress) we were still considered imminent enough terrorist threats that they would need to see our passports. This could just be me being cynical, but surely if one was entering India with the primary aim of setting off a bomb or two they would probably not necessarily be the law-abiding types to follow such rigorous procedures. Or if they were they could of course just use their home phones. Not sure a 40p-per-message charge means much to organisations that can afford mass explosives. Just a thought. Anyway, mission fail for us so we decided with the rest of our break to give the Celebration Mall a bash.

Turns out our rather low expectations were smashed out of the water. It was all looking up when at the entrance there was an actual rubbish bin, even politely requesting that passers-by did not spit into it. From our experience disposing of litter in public places is quite a challenge. I learnt this lesson early on in our trip as, brandishing a blood-stained tissue from one of my multiple toe stubbings on chunks of rogue pavement ,I asked the ticket officer at the museum we were about to enter where I might be able to get rid of it. I was promptly led to a patch of grass by the side of the road.

Me: Er, I was looking for a place to put this rubbish

Man: (very enthusiastically pointing at the patch of grass): Yes, here, rubbish

Me: This is not a place for rubbish, this is the street

Man: No no, rubbish very good here

You will be pleased to know I carried the delightful tissue with me for several more hours until I found a slightly more sanitary means of disposal!

Anyway, back to the mall. After the bin excitement we actually entered and were greeted by a delightful blast of air leading the way to multiple floors of (very open!) shops topped by several golden domes. We attempted to do some shop browsing which was a far from relaxing experience due to the female shop assistants following us around at the heels whilst the men simply took to standing virtually on top of us. At the point when I was looking through some t-shirts on a rail and the woman lurched forwards, removed it and started waving it my face we admitted defeat and retreated to the food court. Where we found Han and two other volunteers from her NGO. Clearly we had hit the Western retreat. It was revealed Constantine, who Han has been emailing for the past few months, was not in fact a motherly middle-aged Indian woman but in fact a 19-year old German gap year student. Confusing introductions over we were invited to join them at the cinema to see Iron Man 3 that evening though the only tickets left were for ‘recliner seats’. As these were still only the equivalent of £2.50 we went for it.

After a very exciting wander round the supermarket Em and I headed back to Seva Mandir to meet Dr Sangeeta who is to be our supervisor. She is an Ayuvedic doctor, very lovely but does not have the most fabulous English which made deducing what she actually wants us to a pretty onerous process. We got the general gist in the end and eventually headed back for a quick change before the cinema, when on the way to get a rickshaw we were offered the best line I have heard so far: ‘madam, which country is suffering without you?!’

We reconvened with Constantine and Katya at the mall for dinner. The process of simply ordering and then paying for food was clearly deemed far too dull so the management have introduced a wonderful system where you have to load a (naturally not-free) plastic card with cash and then use that to purchase your food. Once this palava had been negotiated Han and Em decided to give the egg fajitas a whirl. After about 25 minutes the masterpiece was produced-a 10cm wide wrap topped with scrambled egg with one floret of sautéed broccoli and a couple of other wilted veg items. By this time we were late (despite arriving an hour before the film started) so stocked up on popcorn and headed into the cinema, taking careful heed of the sign which helpfully reminded us not to smoke, shout or rape whilst the film was taking place. So glad they reminded me. Our ‘recliner’ seats surpassed all expectations in the form of plush lazy-boy style chairs complete with electrical adjustable padded foot and head-rest. Definitely the more comfortable than any bed we have encountered so far (they are a fan of the firm/wooden mattress over here); so much so that Han sacrificed a portion of the film for a little snooze! We all enjoyed the film, particularly the intermission which was clearly held precisely halfway the film as the action cut-out mid sentence giving way to torch brandishing workers offering snacks

After the film ended we hopped in the first rickshaw we saw outside the mall. I did think initially our young driver looked slightly blood-shot of eye but he seemed fairly with it so we set off. Error. Let’s just say it is a wonder any man, woman or cow in Udaipur survived the experience, including ourselves. Clearly the inability to boy-race in a rickshaw (though he gave it a good crack) prompted the need to initiate as many near-death experiences as humanly possible. We miraculously screeched to a halt in front of our guest house and retired for the evening, at which point the water tank ran out. Perfect end to a very bizarre day!

A broken man on his way to Bundi Fort
Bundi



This morning we had a nice long lie in following yesterday's early rise. This did unfortunately mean that we were out and about in the mid-day sun. Well, you know what they say about Mad dogs and Englishmen...

From our hotel window you could see the fort and palace rising up from the hillside. From the level we were at it didn't seem to far a climb, but past hiking experiences told me that looks can be deceiving. Armed with sticks “to protect from monkeys” we set off up the hill at a steady/slow pace pausing every 100/200metres to drink more water. The ticket office had informed us that it would only take 15 minutes to reach the fort. I can only say the old man must have had wings. It took us nearly 45 minutes to reach the summit and that at a struggle. Andrew made it to the main gate before collapsing on the steps. I headed up to the main parapet for a better view of the town. The view of the surrounding countryside and rolling hills made the climb for me at least, worthwhile. We will both however quite freely admit that we
Bundi Vista
should have eaten and taken more water with us.

The journey down, whilst quicker, was still very steep. The palace turn-off was about ¾ of the way down the hill.

Bundi Palace was built in the 15th Century and the beautiful palace murals are some of the best preserved in Rajasthan. The warden unlocked a padlocked door and showed us a room covered with the golden painting the Maharanas and the battles they fought. Although really delicate and beautiful, Andrew and I by this point were nearly beaten by the heat. We headed down the hill with Andrew exclaiming that he had no idea how anyone did any manual labour in India . We rewarded our efforts with beautifully cold drinking water and a delightfully freezing shower.


Chittor/ Chittaurgargh



The next morning enroute to Udaipur we stopped off to visit the amazing hill fort at Chittor. The fort put up the strongest fight against the muslim invaders of any of the fortifications in Rajasthan. Disturbingly, it was also the site of three mass johors (suicides) by the women of the fort. On three occasions when faced with impending doom on the battlefield, rather than
Armed with monkey repellents atop Bundi Palace
surrender the wives, sisters and mothers burned themselves alive on the funeral pyres with their husbands sons and brothers smearing their faces with ash before riding to their deaths in battle. The 180m fort standing tall in the Mewar valley has one of the bloodiest histories.

We needed the car to drive between the bastions a as the fort was so large and the sun so hot that it was impossible to walk it. We wondered around our first Jain temple (well I did Andrew's poor feet were finding it difficult on the hot marble – I clearly am a hardened old woman). The stone ring was amazingly detailed with dancing girls and gods and representations of Vishnu rising up it. Kumbha Shayma temple.

Towards the end of the fortifications stands Viyay Stambh, a victory tower erected Rana Kumbha following his victory over the muslim Sultan in 1440. This victory tower stands at 36m high and Andrew and I with our combined vertigo refused to be put off climbing it The steps were very narrow and quite dark but the view from the top of the temples bellow was worth the climb even if again we had to
Golden paintings from Bundi Palace
pose for numerous pictures with the locals. We reached some quiet gardens away from the calls of “photo please” and enjoyed two ice creams for about 40p. Result.
