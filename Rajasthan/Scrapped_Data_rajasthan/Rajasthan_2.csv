Local man
Greetings from Jaipur! The journey back to Delhi airport was as manic and crazy as ever... Trucks, rickshaws, people, cows and buses weaving in and out of each other as usual. 'Honking' and barging their way through towards their final destination. In Delhi, there is no 'right of way' - it's more a case of 'MY way'...

We've learnt quickly not to make eye contact with anyone whilst in the car. Big mistake - the second you do, people will see that as an invitation to beg. We stopped at one set of traffic lights and made eye contact with a very unfortunate looking lady cradling her baby on the side of the road. Immediately, she ran to my side of the window and tapped her knuckles repeatedly, pleading something we couldn't understand. Its an agonising few moments, you feel terrible turning your head away. But there is little else you can do, if you give money, you're only encouraging the problem and making the situation worse. Not to mention you'd then have a flock of beggars suddenly swarming your car...

After a quick and uneventful flight, we arrived in an even hotter climate - Jaipur. The first obvious
IMG_1823
difference was that everyone on motorcycles here actually wears helmets! This came as such a surprise to us - although the roads appear ever so slightly less chaotic than in Delhi (less ''life threatening' shall we say!) .... It's still pretty much a mentality of 'MY way or no way' ... HONK.

The Homestay we're in is nice, quite different to our accommodation in Delhi. Here we are literally living with a family in their home. So we all eat together at the one table and at the same time etc. Which is nice, you end up understanding a bit more about the culture and Indian life in general - here it's very noticeable it's the 'father' who's in charge. Not that we're particularly surprised by this, as mentioned in earlier blogs - the gender divide is quite apparent. But I stress again, we have been overwhelmed by how hospitable and welcoming the Indian people are. What's also really nice about this home, the family take in supposed ""untouchables"" and give them a roof over their heads and food, in return they clean and wash etc. There's a lovely man here actually who's deaf and doesn't speak, apparently he
Market place
just wondered in one day and didn't leave - we've absolutely fallen in love with him. His body language is always so open and so friendly and he smiles ALL the time, so he literally lightens up the room every time he enters. We dread to imagine where he'd be if he wasn't here.

We decided to have a little explore of Jaipur (known as the 'pink city' as the whole towns walls are pink) soon after arriving. The first thing we ventured out to see was The City Palace. I have to say, we were both pretty disappointed: I think the problem is, once you've seen the Taj Mahal, everything else absolutely pales in comparison. It appeared pretty dilapidated and run down, but more than that, the main issue was the tourists :/ coach load after coach load turned up... and because this is a tourist 'hot spot', there are many pushy Indians trying to sell you various objects or items of clothing.... You also get the whole ' ma'am you need guide... You need guide' - you have to be firm and say 'NO' - eugh, hated it

After this, we wanted to avoid any further
IMGP0053
touristy hot spots... so we travelled quite a way out to see the monkey temple, a temple which is over 200 years old where locals live amongst the monkeys! Now this place was certainly not on the 'hot spots'... For a start we had to travel through quite extreme poor areas to get there, known as the slums. We witnessed children on rubbish dumps sifting through the rubbish looking for food. Starving people laying on the sides of the road. It was probably the most extreme we'd seen yet. The problem is, unlike in the UK, there's no welfare system out here - so if you have any disability for example, you have no way of working and thus no money to eat. It's a sad situation and one you can do nothing about.
The dogs also look noticeably worse here than they did in Delhi. Strangely enough it was seeing one poor dog dying on the roadside, which moved me to tears for the first time since arriving in India. The poor thing just looked so alone... and you're just completely helpless. Maybe that's part of the problem, it's a completely helpless situation here. Once arrived at the
Market place
temple, in the middle of the hillside, we were pleased to see not one coach in sight. (We did notice in Delhi actually some embarrassingly ignorant tourists who would refuse to take their shoes off or refuse to cover their hair in the temples - so disrespectful.) This temple was ruined and yet beautiful in it's authenticity. Monkeys running around everywhere, one daring little baby monkey actually opened Jen's bag whilst she was taking a picture - cheeky thief!

We met some of the locals, who again were so friendly and, again, wanted pictures taken with us. The main difference at the Monkey temple (compared to the City Palace) was the fact it was more alive and certainly more authentic. For instance, it's used (and lived in) on a daily basis by the locals, cows and goats are wondering about on the roads, there are no beggars hanging around outside targeting tourists, there are no coaches, no 'tour guides', no cafes...
The temple itself is a Hindu temple, the main difference (to the other temples we've visited) is that Hindu's worship many different gods, so there were many different alcoves with the different gods inside. After the monkey
In the streets...
temple we wanted to explore more of the local villages/towns. So we asked our driver to drop us off at the local Market place (again, no tourists), the driver politely obliged although this time did say, ""local men here, no good. Be very careful. I'll wait here."" So we were on our guard more so than usual, but fortunately encountered no problems. We've quickly understood that if you walk confidently and assertively with your head held high, people generally don't tend to bother you. If you walk nervously and showing noticeable vulnerability, it's usually only then people will come over ""let me help you."" etc.



Fortunately we had no problems, we just walked around in awe - taking in the sheer noise and chaos of the place... We had to hold hands and walk on the road of oncoming traffic - another 'experience' to say the least. We're certainly not quite as quick, nimble and light on our feet as the locals. Its all a bit of an adrenaline rush actually! The locals were actually preparing for a festival, so the whole streets were awash with colour and sound. Music blaring, whistles going off constantly, they were
The Locals at the Monkey Temple
painting the roads an array of different bright colours, elephants were already being marched through the streets - quite spectacular! It made us reflect later on, that there is a much stronger community feel here compared to the UK. They have many festivals where the whole town comes together to celebrate. You know, it's definitely the places where no tourists go, which makes for a much more authentic Indian experience. We both so enjoyed walking through the Market place...

Apologies for the delayed update by the way, all the above covers day 1 in Jaipur. Unfortunately, over the past 48 hours I've been bed ridden and very sick (I clearly spoke too soon ... ""no Delhi belly""!) Hmm.. it started off day 1 during the night, I woke up unable to stop shivering, I put more clothes on and tried to sleep but was burning up quite badly. Then the sickness and diarrhoea started... And it literally didn't stop for 24hours! Horrific. I feel much better today thank goodness, sickness has finally stopped although I'm still in bed and pretty dizzy. Fortunately we've been able to change Mother Theresa home and the elephants all for our last day (tomorrow)
Cows napping in the road
instead - so cross fingers I'll be able to make it then. Jen's been so lovely looking after me, putting cold flannels on my head trying to keep the temperature down, topping me up with rehydration drinks and checking up on me all the time - thank you 'mother hen' lil Jen 😊 I really don't know how I'd have coped if I'd been on my own. She popped out for a few hours yesterday so she'll write something on here later on. It was a pretty horrific experience and one I certainly don't wish to repeat out here... so I'm going to be overly cautious with absolutely everything I eat from now on.



Love to you all x ...Photo's to follow, just experiencing technical difficulties!

Jaipur day 1 Train ride from Agra o Jaipur











We woke up at dawn in Agra and headed out our hotel to catch our taxi ride, same guy we hired for the Agra tour. Unfortunately, he was not there and so we could not afford to wait longer so we took a tuk tuk from the area to the train station. The tuk tuk said 100 rupees, but negotiated the price and paid 50 in the end (it was a 20 minutes ride only). We arrived to the train station to see on the board our train was cancelled UHGGGGG India! Well we got in a long line to ask if there was another train coming and they said yes, but it was all booked and the only places left were on general class: meaning standing (for 5 hours) and obviously super cheap! We then were told we could get a refund and catch the train tomorrow at the same time. First we went to an office were they put a cancelled stamp on our tickets. There we saw a few tourists that were on the same situation, one couple was from Bolivia. When the office agent saw our tickets he said our train was the next day … oops!! So he could not cancelled it plus if he did cancelled it we would have to book a new one. So we headed out again to the reservation booth and they said that our train was scheduled for tomorrow on time. However another group of tourists told us that they had a ticket to Jaipur for the previous day and it was also cancelled, so chances were that our next day train would also be cancelled. Our dilemma was either cancelled our ticket and book general class ticket for the same day, waiting with hope for the next day or taking a private taxi with the rest of the tourists. We had already seen everything in Agra so no point in staying another day, he tourists were trying to negotiate with a taxi and were not getting anywhere and well a train full of people with a backpack on your back and standing for 5 hours. Did not feel appealing. However I got in the line to ask for a train ticket it was a long line full of men and women started to go in front so I took advantage of my sexual gender and also went in front. So I bought 2 general class tickets and we were in for a new train adventure.







We got our things and headed out to the platform to find out our train was late AGAIN! When it finally came we go in and started walking inside the train, which was jammed until we found a place to stand and sit free. Lucky for us no one claimed the bed we were sitting on and so we sat all the 5 hours phew! I even slept all curled down and in a kind of sitting position.







We got to Jaipur around 1 o clock. We were a little annoyed at tuk tuks and decided to walk to the budget hotel area that Lonely Planet recommended. As we walked on small sidewalks not always very well maintained we started to feel the heat of the Rajasthan desert. Even though we only had a very small map Kyle managed to navigate us in an excellent manner all the way to the hotel area. As we were walking we notices that the city was kind of developing and lots of construction, even a metro was being built. We passed a few Indian hotels near the train station, but the area was too crowded and really noisy. I had a hard time with dealing with the commotion, loudness, crowdness and traffic here. Finally, we reached an area that seemed like full of residential houses, but at the same time we saw a few hotels and guesthouses. We walked in the recommended budget hotel from LP but it was all booked so we kind of wandered around and every other tuk tuk driver will say ¨where are you going? I will take you. ¨ But knowing the ability of tuk tuk drivers to scam tourist we always said no, until this one man started to talked to us and even followed us walking leaving his tuk tuk with the engine on in the middle of the street telling us there was an ok not so expensive hotel nearby. We said we will walk to it as it was literally 50 meters away and he insisted and followed us with his tuk tuk. We asked for one room and it was 700 rupees an ok price and so we stayed there. The tuk tuk driver offered to take us around Jaipur´s sights the next day for 600 rupees. He said we only had to pay for gas and maybe a parking space (about 200 rupees in all) so we accepted. He even said that if we did not like his service we could get our money back and did not even have to tip him ( I paused here to say you need to read the next entry on Jaipur to find our what happened with this man).



It was about 3 o´clock by now and we were exhausted. So we chilled in the hotel for a bit and completely passed out until about 8 o´clock.







Indian dinner and The Puppet Show







We went to the rooftop restaurant to eat Indian dinner. As we were waiting for our waiter, two Indian boys one about 12 and the other about 9 years old came by and asked us to see their puppet show. We agreed and they sat us in front of a kind of old-fashioned puppet theatre booth and began the show. The younger boy was hiding and was in charged of the two puppets a kind, queen and a horse. The older boy was in charged of playing the drums and the other was in charge of playing an Indian instrument and make the music. The show was pretty basic, but it was an authentic kids show. So cute! They even told us that it was their grandfather who made those puppets. But of course they wanted to sell the puppets and so here began the dilemma. I just loved the show and felt sensitive about these two boys who were about my nieces ages to be working late at night instead of being at home going to bed and being kids. So I wanted to buy the puppets but they were selling them for a huge amount of money. We negotiated and well the boys stole my heart with their charisma, joy for life, hard work and sweetness. So I now own a pair, queen and king, of Indian handmade puppets fro Rajasthan. We sat down and ordered dinner. Actually Kyle ordered it. We ate chana masala, one of y favorite dishes, chicken tikka, some mixed veggies, roti (bread), panneer and kofta, with a lemon soda. It was absolutely delicious!!!! While we were eating the boys kept coming to us and chatting. They gave us a pair of elephants as a gift because I gave them a four leaf silver clover that I had when I first came to China which had a good luck charm written quote. I translated it to English and wish them the best and signed it Kyle and Alejandra. They told us they went to school until 2 o clock and their favorite subjects were Science, Reading and PE and they learned English for their family business. They would do their homework and at 4 they would come to the hotel restaurant to work until about 12 midnight. It made me reflect a lot about my life, my nieces and nephew and how lucky and the great things we have in our lives. Kyle gave them a few coins from Canada and China and we said our good byes to head to our room for the night.







day 2 Jaipur The Pink City tour







We woke up and had breakfast at the rooftop bar of the hotel, pancakes and french toast. We packed our bags and left them int he hotel storage for the day. Our tuk tuk driver was aready there to take us on a tour of Jaipur otherwise known as The Pink City.







Our tuk tuk driver was a young Indian guy around 20 years old and very determined to show us the sights of Jaipur. First stop was to fill the tuk tuk´s tank with gas. It was about 160 rupees (pretty cheap!)



We then headed towards the city centered and to see the City Palace and Observatory. The City Palace had been restored and well maintained and it was more like a museum. We alked through several romos filled with old paintings, furniture, sculptures of old times. There was a courtyard with a few doors and windows from where the women would see and observe the amenities and festivities of the palace. The guards where dressed with old soldier suits and hats and were demanding tourists for photos with them. I took one and then of course we had to give them some rupees. Then we crossed the street to the observatory. Kyle had been to one in Kolkatta, but I had not been to one, and since the tickets were all included for the sights we decided to go in just for a little bit. It was an open building with lots of cool and astrnomy aparatus that look kind of taken out of a theme park, but you were technically not allowed to go in or on them. The first instrument was like a giant spaceship with a ball in the middle and i think if I am not mistaken it was a measuring instrument. Then we saw a couple of smaller instruments that looked like stairs and benches to sit on. Then we saw a big solar clock. It had the degrees and lines used to tell what time of the day it was. It was a pretty cool thing to see. Then we headed with our tuk tuk driver to the main fort, which actually consisted of three forts. Two of them were attached by an underground tunnel pathway and the other was a bit farther away and had to be reached by rode.











The entrance of Amer fort was magnificient. A steep uphill towards a high and robust entrance door where elephants used to go through when the time of the maharajalas. Then an open courtyard with beautiful gardens and stone brick buildings. We walked for several hours inside the fort´s palace also known as Amer Palace where the RajputMaharajas families used to live. As we walked through the path and hallways of the inside of the palace we came across some kind of laberynth of entrances and up and down staircases. We wandered for a bit until we managed to find an exit to go on the top of the roof of the palace and se Amer fort and Jaigarh Fort, with the gardens and lakes that surrounded. We then headed out the laberynth to find a place to eat and go search for the underground tunnel to Jaigarth fort. We found an American café where we ate some samosas and a doughnut and some lattes and frappuchinos and relaxed for a bit while waiting for the sun to lower so we could head out to Jaighar fort.







The main fort is called Amber or Amer (Hindi) fort and is one of the principal tourist attractions in the Jaipur area, located high on a hill.Amer Fort was built by Raja Man Singh I. Amer Fort is known for its artistic style, blending both Hindu and Rajput elements. With its large ramparts, series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks the Maota Lake, at its forefrontThe aesthetic ambiance of this formidable fort is seen within its walls on a four level layout plan (each with a courtyard) in a well turned out opulent palace complex built with red sandstone and marble consisting of the Diwan-e-Aam or the ""Hall of Public Audience"", the Diwan-e-Khas or the ""Hall of Private Audience"", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace) or Jai Mandir, and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over the water cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amer Fort is also popularly known as the Amer Palace. The palace was lived in by the RajputMaharajas and their families. At the entrance to the palace near the fort’s Ganesh Gate, there is also a temple dedicated to Sila Devi, a goddess of the Chaitanya cult which was given to Raja Man Singh when he had defeated the Raja of Jessore, Bengal in 1604. (Jessore is now in Bangladesh). Amer was known in the medieval period as Dhundar (meaning attributed to a sacrificial mount in the western frontiers) and ruled by the Kachwahas from the 11th century onwards – between 1037 and 1727 AD, till the capital was moved from Amer to Jaipur. The history of Amer is indelibly linked to these rulers as they founded their empire at Amer.



Earlier to the Kachwahas, Amer was a small place built by in the town they consecrated to Amba, the Mother Goddess, whom they knew as 'Gatta Rani' or 'Queen of the Pass'. The Amer Fort, as it stands now, was built over the remnants of this earlier structure during the reign of Raja Man Singh, Commander in Chief of Akbar’s army and a member of the Emperor's inner circle of nine courtiers, in 1592. The structure was fully expanded by his descendant, Jai Singh I. Even later, Amer Fort underwent improvements and additions by successive rulers over the next 150 years, until the Kachwahas shifted their capital to Jaipur during the time of Sawai Jai Singh II, in 1727.



Many of the ancient structures of the medieval period of the Meenas have been either destroyed or replaced. However, the 16th century impressive edifice of the Amer Fort and the palace complex within it built by the Rajput Maharajas are very well preserved.



The fort is divided into four main sections each with its own entry gate and courtyard. Main entry is through the Suraj Pole (Sun Gate) which leads to Jaleb Chowk, which is the first main courtyard. This was the place where armies would hold victory parades with their war bounty on their return from battles, which were also witnessed by the Royal family women folk through the latticed windows. This gate was built exclusively and was provided with guards as it was the main entry into the palace. It faced the eastern direction towards the rising Sun and hence the name. Royal cavalcades and dignitaries entered the palace through this gate.



Jaleb Chowk is an Arabic usage, which means a place for soldiers to assemble. This is one of the four courtyards of the Amer Palace, which was built during Sawai Jai Singh’s reign (1693–1743 AD). The Maharaja's personal bodyguards held parades here under the command of the army commander or Fauj Bakshi. The Maharaja used to inspect the Guards contingent. At this location, the horse stables were also



(information taken from Wikipedia)







This fort, along with Jaigarh Fort, located immediately above on the Cheel ka Teela (Hill of Eagles) of the same Aravalli range of hills, is considered as one complex, as the two are well connected by a subterranean passage. This passage was meant as an escape route in times of war for the royal family members and others in the Amer Fort to shift to the more redoubtable Jaigarh Fort. The fort, rugged and similar in structural design to the Amber Fort, is also known as Victory Fort. It has a length of 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) along the north-south direction and a width of 1 kilometre (0.62 mi). The fort features a cannon named “Jaivana”, which was manufactured in the fort precincts and was then the world's largest cannon on wheels. The palace complex (Laxmi Vilas, Lalit Mandir, Vilas Mandir and Aram Mandir) located within the fort has a well-tended garden where the royal family resided, the Shubhat Niwas (an assembly hall of the warriors), an armoury and a museum. Jaigarh Fort and Amber Fort are connected by subterranean passages and considered as one complex







We finally got to the entrance of the underground tunnel to head to Jaighar fort. Inside the tunnel we were checked for our tickets and then a guard told us to follow him. Wondering where he would take us and thinking this would cost us some money we followed him with a little distrust. It turned out that he wanted to show us how on the top roofs of the tunnel there lived zillions of bats and were sleeping at that time. It was very dark, kind of chilly and it made a good hiding place for bats. While Kyle was taking pictures I wandered around looking and hoping that no bat would get scared of the flash and start flying by us like crazy. If there is one animal I do not like is bats! We tipped the guard a few rupees and continued our walk though the tunnel which was short and then it turned into a very narrowed open pathway. We reached the exit of the pathway and were in a large open kind of terrace that lead to a steep hill. We started our way up and got sidetracked by a sight seeing viewpoint so we stopped for photos and then decided to cut some distance by going uphill through a dirt and rocky trail. It was a little hard for me because I was not wearing my hiking shoes nor sandals, but a pair of cheap Thai mary jane kind of shoes. I managed to climb all the way up and reached the top to see a bunch of monkeys, dogs, cows and goats walking by. We paid an extra fee for one camera and headed in with soldier who apparently knew lots about the fort and so was kind of a tour guide. Apparently this fort, jaighar was privately owned and that is why we had to ay extra. It belonged to the daughter of one of the old kings and now Jaughar fort and the city palace are part of their family heir. We went to an open courtyard and one one of the sides there was a roof building, which had some glass panels and inside there were replicas of the king´s and his family house furniture. Then we walked to another area and say some cannonballs and finally reached the end of the fort where there was the oldest and biggest on wheels cannon. It was huge! After about 3.5 hours wondering around we headed out to look for our tuk tuk driver.







We told out tuk tuk driver we wanted to see the Pink City which was basically the old city of Jaipur and a famous 5 story building all painted In pink, which looked more like orange to us, but oh well to India it was pink. We headed to the old city and immediately say the 5 story building, which was restored just on the outside to look the same through all the city walls. On the bottom of the building there were stores, shops, restaurants, and places to get souveniers, food and more. Driving along the way we saw a huge chaos city. A real Indian city I should say. Cars, tuk tuks and motorcyles going in both directions, men riding elephants and camels, cows, goats and other animals on the street. The honks of the crazy drivers beeping at different tones and rhythms, the people shouting selling food, and other items; it was crazy madness. Finally, we reached the back of the famous Hawa Majal paid a small feel and climbed through a narrowed and steep rounded staircase up to the top. When we got out the view of the city was incredible and all around us we could see why it is called Pink City. All Jaipur was painted in this pinkish, orange kind of color. It felt quiet, relaxing to be up there and leave the craziness of India for a tiny little bit of time away from us. We headed down and told out driver we wanted to see monkey´s temple. But to our not surprise the driver had scheduled some touristic traps for us. He was taking us to a fabric, clothes, bags fabric to see the silk made in Jaipur. Then he took us to another one where they made jewelry out of stones. By the time it was getting dark and we really were not interested so we blew the owner off by saying we did not want to see the jewelry and headed out the door. The driver was going to take us to his fathers shop but we said no firmly and finally he took us to what looked like a big slump. It was almost 7 o´clock and dark and he dropped us off at a small alley where two kids about teenagers started to talk us into giving us a tour of the monkey temple. We agreed to give them some money, whatever we felt like giving to them at the end of the ¨tour¨. I was a little nervous as we were the only foreigners and it rally looked like a slump. I guess being from Venezuela makes me more aware of where to go and where not to go and even though I was with Kyle and I knew we were safe and ok because it was not a close area I was a little nervous and kept by Kyle´s side all the time. The monkey temple was at the top of a hill and it was basically all in ruins. Now there was only a small room where people chant and pray but the main area is all in ruins. We watch from the rooftop as the day ended and the night sky filled the city. In the distance we heard a siren and when we looked around we saw a massive bus on fire. It had big hot red and yellow flames and a big cloud of gray smoke. It started to come down and then we heard a big boom kind of sound. The fire truck that was zooming around and which we though was going towards the burning bus suddenly turned around and went just past it. We walked and took some pictures but soon there was nothing else to see and so we headed down to find the tuk tuk driver.







The tuk tuk driver wanted to take us again to his family business but we said we were tired and wanted to find a hotel. He kindly took us to pick up our bags and to search for a cheaper hotel. When we got to the hotel we got off the tuk tuk and were about to give him the 600 rupees we had agreed to pay him for the day when the guy realized that we had spend more than what he actually had said and wanted about 3000 rupees. We, well me, started to argue with the driver about all we , Kyle and me and him had said and specifically about this one line the driver said ¨ 600 rupees plus gas and if you like my service you give me whatever tip you want and if you do not like my service you pay me nothing. ¨Well of course what was our surprise, he had forgotten this personal quote. We ended up paying him about 900 and left to go inside the hotel. I was so pissed!! Lesson learned, never believe a tuk tuk driver and make sure to agreed on number of hours, gas, parking, and tip before you leave for the tour.







We got our hotel room, unpacked and showered. We went out to get some snacks and drinks and then headed to our room to relax for the evening!







The next morning we decided to have a lazy day and slept in and had a nice breakfast and headed out the door to wander around the city and try to find souveniers and a post office to mail my 20 or so post cards to family and friends. We headed out the hotel with a clear view of where we wanted to go, but not actually any plans. We wandered around passing through a large main street full of small stores and saw lots of abandoned construction sites. For my time in India I have realized how similar the country is to my home country Venezuela. The traffic was insane. There were no sidewalks and so we had to walk on the edge of the street one behind the other and cars would drive by so fast they would almost hit us. By noontime, we had found the post office and mailed our post cards and were starving. So we started to look for a place to eat. We first got in a hotel, which had a big sign advertising an authentic Indian restaurant, but when we got in the restaurant was so empty it gave us a bad idea and also the prices were extremely expensive. So we wandered off. Then we thought we saw a small street food place but it as a butcher and so we kept walking. Finally, we saw what looked like an American pizza place and we got in. The place seemed nice but it was really loud as there was a group of middle school girls celebrating a birthday and lord were they loud! We settled for a large pizza and a large jug of sprite. It was good and we were hungry. When we finished we went to Jaipur´s bazaar area to wander and find souveniers. The bazaar was jus like other Indian bazaars narrowed streets with vendors on both sides. Every other corner you would see a chai vendor and so we had to have our street chai in Jaipur. It was actually very good. We walked through a few alleys and then headed back to the hotel realizing we were not going to find any souveniers in this area. We walked back to our hotel and took a shower, packed up and sat at the rooftop bar eating some delicious pakora, and chapatti with chai as we waited until it was time to leave for our night train to Jaisaimer.

Harry our driver
We feel safe with him
Jodhpur to Udaipur
Harry was waiting for us at nine and we left our lovely retreat, probably the loveliest place we have stayed for a long time. The journey started off across the flat plains of Rajastan but soon we were in to the countryside. There is much evidence of farming and people are using old methods, carrying water on their heads and wheat they have cut. There are haystacks as they prepare for the dry season. Cows meander across the road and we have to slow down to avoid them. Lots of men congregate hoping to get some work for the day and the markets are starting to get busy. The mountains appear either side of the road and we begin to ascend. The land becomes drier and more desert like when we stop for a drink. It is very hot and to only 11 am. We carry on and notice that the surroundings seem litter free, we pass through a small town and they have pavements! and no rubble, wait now it comes and women are digging out a channel for the rain when it comes.We stop at Ranakpur to visit one of the largest and most important of Jain
1444 pillars all different
Temple complexes in India. Built in 1439 it has 1444 pillars all different and each telling a verse of the holy book of the Jain religion. Before entering he temple we must be dressed correctly, no shoes or socks, long skirt, or trousers, no leather of any kind as the Jain believe that killing is wrong and will not even eat an egg, luckily plants remain in the diet they obviously didn't understand that plants are living organisms. The temple is awesome with intricate designs on every pillar, it really should be a wonder of the world. As I walk down the steps a holy man blesses me and puts an orange mark on my forehead and for that I have to give him some rupees! HOLY.?? We leave this amazing temple and drive to Udaipur complete with our new guide Andvil Singh who is the most delightful young man who instantly starts to compete with Steve at jokes, now that was amusing. We discussed what we were going to do and decided to have lunch then do the second two temples today and move the boat ride to tomorrow. We had lunch outside overlooking a lake in the countryside
One image we were allowed to photograph
with birds all around. Another yummy curry can't believe we are enjoying the food so much all vegetarian and amazing variety.Lunch over and we are back on the road, all sorts of animals inhabit these hills but for how long, their habitats are being destroyed and the number of leopards are on the decline. The government want to make this a national park but that would mean moving many indigenous tribes away from where they have always lived, and naturally they are not happy about that. We saw some of these people walking in the markets and on the hills all dressed in beautiful bright colours.We drove to Sas-Bahu temple at Nagda which is no longer used and dates back to the 11th century. There are two temples here one known as mother-in-law temple and the other as daughter-in -law temple, both were intricately carved and although they had had their statues removed you could see an outline of where Lord Vishnu once was. The temples were built beside a lake and egrets, kingfishers, and coots were flying about or on the lake and a woman washing her clothes on the rocks. Acacia, mango, and spruce trees all around made
View of temple from the outside
This should be a wonder of the world it is amazing
this a very peaceful place.From here we drove to a 9th century active temple in the town of Eklingji which is dedicated to Lord Shiva, the god of destruction. We had to remove shoes and socks and were then treated by women selling flower rosaries, long chains of flowers which they were selling for 10 rupees, these were to give to the God. People were praying when we arrived and their offerings accepted by the priest. Spontaneously music and singing started and we just stood and watched. Again this temple is intricately designed. Each column of marble is carved and the masons were paid according to the amount of marble they removed the more marble the more gold hence the amazing carvings.We finally arrived at our hotel about 7 and at last had Internet although at a cost. A good meal in the restaurant and a night on the computer before we eventually went to bed at about midnight.

Well we are home at last !!! Our trip has been amazing but before we sign off we need to tell you a few things about our “Golden Triangle Tour”. (Sorry no computer to record there!)



First we found India a country of massive contrasts- real poverty with families living on rubbish dumps with any available material for roofs etc to very modern large houses. It is still very male dominated in some areas so Sally’s blonde hair caused quite a stir, especially when we stopped at traffic lights!!!!

We toured from Delhi to Agra to Jaipur and back. Our favourite place was Jaipur with its colourful shops and wide streets with camels, oxen and horses all travelling on the roads with the cars and bikes, even sometimes just nibbling food in the middle of the road!

We visited the Amber City with its 9 kilometre walls enclosing a fort and three palaces; the summer one made from white marble with a grass screen which even had dripping water to keep it cool, winter made from marble with thousands of mirror mosaics which would have reflected the light from the oil lamps and carpets and the monsoon palace made of limestone to draw out the humidity- clever !!! Well the king had so many wives each had to have separate rooms, but to stop jealousy they weren’t allowed into each other’s rooms and he even had a secret passage so they didn’t know who he was visiting !!

We loved Fatehpur Sikri which was a deserted town from the Mughal dynasty. This king had three wives one Hindu, one Christian and one Muslim and he built them each a palace each in the traditional style but with little reflections of the other two. There was even a swimming pool where the king would come to choose his lady and a massive courtyard with a huge board type game where the ladies would dance across according to the throw of the dice !!!

Another fascinating place was the Royal Observatory at Jaipur which has the largest sun dial in the world(90 ft) accurate to 2 seconds as well as loads of other astronomical devices for dates, times and horoscopes. These are used all the time eg when getting married couples would first plot their two horoscopes to find best date then plan from there unlike us , where booking the venue is our most important thing.

Of course we have to mention the Taj Mahal. It is so beautiful you cannot really believe you are standing there. It was built by Shah Jahan for his beloved wife when she died giving birth to her 14th child- yes girls 14th!!! It took 20,000 workers 17 years to complete and the marble was brought 180 miles by elephant because it reflected the light !! Love indeed!! All the marble is inlaid, no painting and he was going to build a matching black Taj over the river but one of his sons dethroned and imprisoned him so it was never built.

Thank you so much for reading our blogs. We hope they have given you a taste of our fantastic trip.



All we can say now is ….. what’s next??????

Asia » India » Rajasthan » Sambhar Lake
February 21st 2013
Published: March 31st 2013


Goatherds, not bandits!
Wearing masks to shield them from the dust, these men (or were they women?) herded their goats along the road from Roopangarh to Sambhar.
I didn't spend 35 years in the travel industry to plan a five-week tour of an interesting country that only includes things every other tourist goes there to see, did I? That's why, when I realised that our journey from Roopangarh to Jaipur would pass within a few miles of the largest salt lake in India and that this was also home to some prolific bird-life, I knew I had to take the 'Grey haired nomads' and their binoculars to see it. Anyway, I was curious to find out how the powdery white stuff I sprinkle on my fish and chips was produced.

So it was that we wound our way along dusty roads, passing occasional herds of goats on the way to their day's grazing, and through villages with little owls dozing in ancient trees, northwards towards Sambhar Lake.

Less than an hour after leaving Roopangarh, we reached the edge of this vast saline wetland surrounded by hills of the Aravali range and occupying an area of some 200 square kilometres (apparently, it fluctuates between 190 and 230 square kilometres depending on the season - it's at its largest during the monsoon of course). The lake, a shimmering,

distant, land-locked sea, is divided by a five kilometre stone dam and, when the concentration of salt in the water on its western side reaches the desired level, brownish, algae-rich brine is released into evaporation ponds on the eastern side. There it crystallizes and is extracted for processing. This valuable commodity has been exploited commercially throughout the past thousand years. Not surprisingly, therefore, 'Sambhar' actually translates as 'salt'.

In the late-19th century, the maharajas of Jaipur and Jodhpur, who then jointly owned the lake, leased it to the ruling British. They improved the technology and built a narrow-gauge railway to ease transport of the raw material to processing plants. Upon independence in 1947, everything was returned to the Indian government and little seems to have changed since that very day.

None of us, including our driver, had ever been here before but enquiries lead us to the premises of the state-owned Salt Iodization and Processed Salt Plant near Sambhar town's railway station. Here, a lady manager kindly volunteered to give us a guided tour of what was clearly once a state-of the-art processing plant but whose boilers and conveyors were now rusting away, doubtless soon to be overtaken

by private concerns that had invested in modern machinery. Almost everything here, from the washing of the raw, pinkish-brown slabs of salt crystals to the weighing and bagging of the finished, iodized, white product was done by hand. I'm glad we saw it before all this disappears for ever.

The area around the lake is officially recognised as a wetland of international importance. Algae and bacteria growing in the lake support an ecology that sustains migrating waterfowl and it's become a key wintering area for flamingos and other birds. Although we did see a flock of flamingos in flight (see panorama above), they waded far out in the centre of the vast, shallow lake and we had to content ourselves with closer views of more familiar wading birds and ducks. It was, however, good practice for this novice wildlife photographer!

We still had a hundred kilometres to go before reaching our destination for the day, so, joining the Expressway, we continued eastwards to the capital of Rajasthan, the Pink City of Jaipur.

Vcera som zas nemohol zaspat,nervozite pred cestou. Rano ma este chytila este dvojita sracka,tak sprint po schodoch na strechu. Tam bol klasicky zachod,turecak pri izbe nesplachoval.

O 6/00 sme sa na recepcii stretli s kanadankou,u ktorej som sa vcera sprchoval. Pred ubytkom nas uz cakal riksak,bol to ten chuj ,ktoreho som sa vcera pytal kolko stoji cesta. Fakt nahoda,milion riksakov a akurat dojde tento. Kanadanka uz nastupovala,pytam sa kolko to bude stat,neodpovedal,az nakonec z neho vypadlo,ze 100rupii,bo ranna prirazka. Nasrat ti debil,to sa tam uz zacal recepcny rozplivat,ze ho dohodil a cul s nim musime ist,pako. Nakonec som kanadanku presvedcil,ze pojdeme na stanovisko riksako a odtial zobereme lacnejsieho. Po ceste nas dobehol tento a zlavil na neskutocnych 80 rupii,stanovisko riksakov bolo este asi 10.min chodze a cas nas uz tlacil tak sme museli zobrat tohto predrazeneho debilka. Hned ako nas vylozil pri buse ,ten sa pohol,bolo to o fuz.

V buse opat problem s miestnenkou,na mojom mieste sedel clovek,tak som si sadol za nho,vedla mna sedel ind. Asi dalsi 4 ludia mali presne take iste sedadlo ako ja. Bus mix sleeper/seat opat stal na kazdom kroku a naberal milion ludi. Totalny natresk. Cez ulicku sedeli nevsedny japonci zo vcera.

Po 4.5 hod sme dorazili do Jaisalmeru. Cestou boli asi 3 vojenske kasarne a v nich plno vojenskej techniky. Znak,ze sa blizime k pakistanskej hranici. V meste sa to hemzilo vojakmi ale zrejme tu boli len na vychadzku bo nakupovali same suveniry.

Po zastaveni busu ludia zacali postupne vystupovat,zrazu sa dnu zacali tlacit dvaja dementi. Fakt demencia,vsetci vystupuju len oni sa drbu dovnutra,pritom bus tu mal konecnu. Neskor sa z ich ust zacalo drat moje meno. Ha,to boli moji dohodnuty indicky odrbavaci co ma mali spolu s kanadankou zaviest do mojho hotela co som si zarezervoval v Jodhpure. No nepriznal som sa k nim. Rozhodol som sa cestou,ze si najdem vlastne ubytko a hlavne ma nasral ten odbravac z kuku GH v Jodhpure kde som byval. Bohuzial kanadanka ma prezradila ale i tak som tuto chamrad ignoroval. Nakoniec boli stastny,ze ulovili kanadanku a dali pokoj,lenze pri buse bolo daslich asi 10 otravnych indov,kazdy ma chcel zobrat do svojho hotela. Fakt uz som mal riadne nervi. Zamieril som si to k policajtovy,to uz dali pokoj. Jeho som sa pytal na bus stanicu,nevedel ma navigovat alebo nechcel. Non ist tak som studoval LP mapu a zadaval adresy do gps,po 15.min som sa rozhybal k pevnosti.

Podla rady LP som sa chcel ubytovat mimo pevnosti,vraj su vnutri problemy s vodou. Obehal som cestou 4 ubytka,vsetko po 300 rup,v jednom davali 150 rup ale nevedeli anglicky,tak ktovie ci to bola nakonec pravda,sa mi volako nepozdavali,bo furt s volakym volali. Nakonec som zakotvil v ubytku za 200rup, dvojpostel, fan,sprcha, zachod. Nevyhoda bola studena voda,tepla ide iba rano. Zlavit nechceli ale neva,uplny klud,fajn vyhlad na pevnost zo strechy. Byvali tu samy indovia. Ziadny turisti. Camel safari v tomto ubytku neorganizuju,zrejme aj preto,ze tu byvaju len indovia.

Cakal ma prieskum camel safari. Hned za ubytkom bola prva cestovka,chlapik ma posadil a kecal a kecal a kecal. Nedal sa zastavit,na cenu neodpovedal,furt len kecal a kecal o safari ake je ich najlepsie. Mezdi tim ako kecal mi jeho poskok donisol caj,po 15.min tlacenia kalerabov do hlavy z neho konecne vypadla cena jeden a pol dna za 1000 v turistickej casti a 1500 v neturistickej casti. Dobra palka,podla LP to malo byt do 700rup. Bus do jaipur NAC seat za 500rup. Ten mal podla najnovsej LP stat 375 rup,inak zatial ani jedna cena busu z LP nesedela,vsetko stoji viac.

Po cajiku som sa vybral do dalsej cestovky. Tu mi chlapik otvorene povedal,ze su drahy a robia safari len pre bohacov,cena okolo 4000rup.

No nist tak som sa vybral do pevnosti do ganesh travel,tu mi odporucil LP a este aj chlapik z tej drahej cestovky,vraj su najlacnejsi a najspolahlivejsi. Mensi problem ich najst, sidlia v mini ulicke v pevnosti. Neskor zistene,ze vsetky ulicky su tu mini. Tu bola ponuka 1100rup za 1 a pol dna, 1500rup za dva dni. Fakt mega rozdiel oproti LP.Bus za 400rup

No nic teda,isiel som sa prejst po pevnosti a zistoval camel safari v hoteloch. Same tlacenie kalerbov,cena 1000rup za den,inde za 2000rup. V jednom ubytku som stretol argentincanku co zhanala ubytko a tiez camel safari. Isiel som s nou do ganesh travel,ci nam neda zlavu ked sme dvaja,podla neho uz mal v skupine 6 ludi, maxim je 9. No zlavu nedal. Tak som siel s argenticankou dalej po hoteloch. Nakonec skoro zakotvila v Ganesh Gh za 200rup,free wifi,tepla sprcha,fajn izbicka. UZ to chcela zobrat ale napadlo mna nech si otestuje tu teplu vodu,skusenost s mt.abu,jasne,ze netiekla. Ale majitel sa dusoval,ze to treba nechat odtiect. No nist,presunuli sme sa oproti. Zakopol som o schod a trochu zahresil po nasi. Jeden par co tam sedel na mna kukol. Ajeje konecne dalsi slovaci po dlho case. Argentincanka si omrkoval izbu,ja som zatial kecal s nasimi. V indii su mesiac,toto je ich posledna zastavka. Blavaci chodia kazdy rok na mesiac do indie,maju za sebou Barmu ,Banglades, Thajsko a malajziu. Buduci rok idu do vietnamu. Odporucil som im filipiny ale ich sa boja,bo tam daky ich znami vraj zil 15 rokov a musel odtial utiect,vraj dost nebezpecna krajina. No nevim,mne sa to nebezpene nezdalo ale zas som tam bol len 20 dni. Oni mali camel safari za 2000rup/ks na den ale boli iba dvaja.Arg tu nakonec ostala,s camel safari este nvie,vraj pocka kym dostane lepsiu cenu.

Ja som necakal a siel si to rezervovat do ganesh travel za 1100 na jeden a pol dna + som zobral aj bus do Jaipuru za 400rup. V ganesh GH som stretol korejca a on bol tiez cez ganesh travel a vraj pohoda,spokojnost. Ganesh travel a ganesh GH je jedna firma. Po camel safari mam slubenu gratis sprchu v ganesh GH. V skupine budem mat 2 poliakov,2 kolumbijcanov,2 kanadanov a mozno bude aj argentincanka. Safari konci o 11/00,bus mi ide o 16/30,takze pohodicka. Odvoz na bus sa tu nekona,tak ako vo vietname,musim sa dopravit sam na bus stanicu. Neni o com,india najhorsia krajina zatial,myslim,ze turecko ju nema sancu predstihnut,tak mozem teda vyhlasit,fuck of india.

Slovaci velice vychvalovali udaipur,nevim ci volaco tahali abo co,sak to je totalna diera.

Inak zatial mam pozitivny dojem z tohto mesta,paradne pevnost,relativna cistota,fajn jedlo. Keby som vedel,tak tu ostanem viac dni. No neda sa,uz ma zacina tlacit cas a este chcem vidiet par miest. Z hradieb je fajn vyhlad,okolie sama vyschnuta zem,piesok,sem tam strom.

Dalsi plan je ist si opat prezriet pevnost a jedlo. Dochadzaju mi prachy. V jaipure spravim vyber len nevim este kolko,musim si to prepocitat aby som zbytocne vela penez nevyberal.

V restike oproti mojmu ubytku som stretol kanadanku,japoncov a cinanov z jodhpuru. Kanadanka hovorila,ze som dobre spravil a nesiel do toho hotela. Celu dobu do nich furt hucali o camel safari aby ho kupili od nich. Normalne odtial musela utiect,sa to nedalo vydrzat.

Japonec rozpraval o tom reaktore co u nich vybuchol. Vlada vsetko ututlava,dost ludi vlade neveri a buria sa. Spor s cinou o ostrov co som zazil v xian je nafuknuta bublina,o ziadnu historiu nejde ale ide o ropu co je pod ostrovom. Media ale masiruju obcanov s historiou a podobnymi srackami.

Dobra sprava,asi som pribral,musel som si povolit opasok. Pivo tu je nehorazne drahe 150rup,v goa 50rup

Po jedle a relaxe na streche ubytka som siel omrknut bus stanicu odkial mi pojde bus do jaipuru. Cestou som omrkol miestny stadion,len sucha hlina,ziadna trava. Miestny tu hrali kriket. Bude tu aj camel festival,bohuzial v tomto case tu uz nebudem,som si to mohol lepsi zistit a naplanovat,no nist teda. Zo stadiona som sa pobral dalej vyprahnutou cestou,dostal som sa na miestny trh al ziadne jedlo. Uz sa tu zacinala objavovat prava tvar indie,bordel. Cisto je len v pevnosti resp popri nej inde bordel.

V dialke som zbadal vezicku,na reku idem tam,bo som tam videl dost ludi. Dostal som sa pod nu ale nevedel som najst schody,tak som rezal priamo do kopca. Este sa pytam inda ci s tym neni problem,vraj nie. V pohode vystup. Ked som bol asi v 1/4 zrazu pocujem za sebou krik deti no,no,no, obzrel som sa,no neskoro,pohryzol ma zasrany pes. Zakerne zo zadu,zahnal som sa a uzaj fujazdil na kopec. Nastastie ziadna krv,kukli mi to 2 indovia vraj pohoda. Uvidime co sa z toho vykluje. Nastastie pes vyzeral normalne,ziadna pena okolo huby.

Vyhlad z vezicky bol fajnovy,paradny pohlad na mesto a super vyhlad na pevnost. Nazad som siel uz po normalnej ceste kam ma nasmerovali dvaja indovia. Zbadal som tu aj turisticky bus s kopou starych zapadniarov.

Ponahlal som sa do ubytka vydenzifikovat si pohryznutie. GPS ma navigoval zas bocnymi ulickami,bordel,spina,chudoba. Panika vzdy ked som zbadal psa.

Na ubytku osetrenie,zistene,ze mam az dva hryzance,pritom som citil len jeden.

Zbalenie batohu,nakup susienok a vody na zajtra. I ked voda je v cene ale clovek nikdy nevi.Potom behnutie Milanovy,nazov restiky oproti ubytku,na veceru a spanok.

Ak bude rano tepla voda,tak dam mozno aj sprchu a potom smer ganesh tour. Dufam,ze nebudu problemy s mojou pohryznutou nohou.

Do navratu domov mi ostavaju zhruba 4 tyzdne.

Kukal som adresu co mi poslal CS v jaipure,su to tri ozne miesta. Tak teda nevim co cul.

Jo a uz nechodim po bocnych ulickach,uz len po hlavnych tahoch. Uz nech som v turecku.

Este aj debilny komari su tu,uz nemam rad jaisalmer

Havelis
Blog 26-31 January: Rajasthan II - Jaisalmer and Udaipur

""Talking talking, sitting sitting, eating eating""

We arrived in the early morning dark in Jaisalmer, after the night train, to a mob of touts absolutely desperate to stick placards in our faces and convince us to go to their hotels. It's probably the closest we'll ever get to feeling like celebs with out of control paparazzi. We escaped back into the station to await the arrival of our hotelier who was due to pick us up but had been asleep.

We woke up at lunchtime to the view from the rooftop restaurant of a sandstone fort looming out of the rock and turrets reaching for the sky like pert meerkats watching out for intruders. This is the first fort we had seen that is packed with inhabitants. We spent the afternoon marvelling at some havelis (old intricately carved mansions) from the outside (we are on a budget after all) and wandering through the narrow winding lanes of the fort. We had got to the stage where we also felt it was ok to skip the tour of the palace and spend our time getting lost and getting a feel
Cow alert!
for the place rather than continuing to religiously tick off the cultural highlights in our guidebook.

The compressed streets were a welcome solace from the manic tuk tuks but it didn't stop the motorbikes blaring their way through, barging passed the wedding horses and drum processions. However, I think it's worth mentioning that the thing that has caused the most concern throughout our trip on the streets has been the aimless wandering cattle. For a farmer's son Charlie has surprised me with his inability to casually walk past cows in the street. His fear for his life has reached such heights that we had to develop the 'cow alert' protocol so he can prepare himself in advance (apparently it's the horns that are the worry). Despite this the cows seem to love him as he's even been followed down the road by an over enthusiastic inquisitive calf. It turns out that my ignorance of bovine behaviour has served me well as I squeeze past the holy animals!

Jaisalmer is in the middle of the Thar desert and the last town before reaching Pakistan. Our journey that far West was in search of an Arabian Nights experience... We set
Kites everywhere
off towards our camel safari with great expectations of rolling dunes and perhaps a tranquil oasis and palm trees along the way. In reality we rocked up to a testosterone filled camel named Daniel, a landscape of shrubby earth (not sand) and a cloudy sky.

As we prepared to mount our beasts, with our keen photographer Taiwanese companions, a guttural gurgle came from Charlie's camel Daniel. I saw something fleshy, bulbous and and highly disturbing emerge from Daniel's fury lips. Full of shock and grimaces our guides tried to reassure us by explaining that it was mating season as the aubergine shaped sack ""popped"" back into his mouth. Without time to think about my luck having not been allocated Daniel, my camel stood up. It turns out this is not a simple feat. Its stilt like legs have to unfold from under it to raise itself from the ground and this required me to hold on for dear life gripping my legs unnaturally wide apart around its back as wide as an armchair and as comfy as a bucking bronco. Charlie had expected reins and stirrups but instead we were led along by 2 young guides who didn't speak

much English. An hour or so later we arrived at what can only be described as a giant sandpit dumped in the middle of the barren terrain. This was our desert and I wasn't going to complain. We walked over one sandy hillock and realised that if we positioned our camera just right no one would be any the wiser.

After some snacks and chai from the camp fire our Taiwanese friends stood up out of the blue and announced they were leaving. An English speaking guide had arrived in his jeep to take them back. This had not been expected by us and we began to feel a little abandoned in the middle of nowhere. Always keen to embrace the experience we joined our young guides around the fire to their bewilderment (I think tourists are supposed to be separate) and tried to initiate some awkward conversation. As the evening drew in the guys relaxed and were enthusiastic that we would be ""talking talking, sitting sitting, eating eating"". Charlie taught them noughts and crosses and days of the week and they taught us how to sing along to their favourite songs on their phone. My personal favourite was
Jaisalmer fort in the background
the old school 1990s classic ""Shaggy - Girl I want to Make You Sweat"" , not exactly what we had expected from our night in the desert.

We slept out in blankets on the sand, with the two stars we could see through the clouds, under the brilliantly bright full moon. As surreal as it had been it was a fun experience and blissfully peaceful (apart from Daniel's regular gurgles). We woke up to watch the sun rise over the dune (singular) and then having earned the trust of our guides were allowed to spend some of our journey back with the camels ""running running, good good"" at a lolloping trot. In high sprits we felt we had mastered the art of our guides' English phrases ""good good, 24 hour full power, 100 per cent"" we shouted as we sang to try and get the camels to go faster.

Our next journey was to Udaipur and we squirmed our way into our double bed upper bunk on the overnight bus full of excitement. The bunk turned out to be searing hot in the afternoon heat but the view was great as we hurtled along the road. The whirlwind
Camel trek day 1
of the day and the sauna of a bunk had lulled us into a false sense of comfort which we realised as the temperature began to plummet drastically after sunset. With 12 more hours to go we hunkered down and tried to sleep through the bumping vibrations and chilly breeze thinking of our bags stowed under the bus with all our warm clothes in. Unable to sleep at 1am we whipped out the ipad and distracted ourselves with the film Mrs Brown. There's nothing like a bit of Judy Dench and Billy Connolly's hollering to distract us in our time of need!

Udaipur was a welcome rest for us as we knew we were staying 3 nights so could relax a bit and take our activities down a notch. We stayed in a lovely old haveli right on the edge of the lake. Udaipur is such beautiful city and we felt at home. There is a real Venetian element to the buildings right on the water and it was all quite calm. The lake is the focal point of the city with a palace built in the middle (which has since been turned into an exclusive hotel) and surrounded
Holding on tight
by hills. This is also the setting for the James Bond Octopussy film which is screened at different hotels around the lake as the city's claim to fame. As we were there they were filming a Bollywood film at one part of the shoreline and we could hear the director's enthusiastic ""action!"" followed by blood curdling screams at regular intervals throughout one afternoon. It seems that stardom isn't all it's cracked up to be as a traveller we met had been roped into being an extra and was being paid the grand sum of £1 per hour.

We went to the old palace as we got some free tickets from some rich French tourists when we were having a beer in a posh hotel on the lake. It was impressively big and recently we have been getting more of a visual representation of what the fort or palace rooms would have looked like in the more recent places we have visited. This palace however, was on the more tacky and gaudy side leaving us wondering how you could have so many intricately mirrored and tiled rooms without getting a headache.

Unfortunately as much as we loved Udaipur we
Bonding with Daniel
didn't get the chance to enjoy it as much as we had planned to. The Thursday morning was not a great day for me as hard core food poisoning reared its ugly head. Fortunately we had a tiled bathroom, and were actually staying somewhere nice as I spent the whole day in bed. It wasn't a pretty sight. Charlie had to nurse me and we have certainly taken the next step in our relationship having to contend with the first real obstacle of our journey. I certainly wouldn't have been able to face the prospect of travelling to Mumbai the next day if he hadn't provided me with as much medication as I could take!

Day 9: Christmas Day.



Woke at 8am, excited to share this ‘special day’ with the children.<span> Stockings, made by Grandma, had travelled with us so duly were filled on Christmas Eve by Father Christmas. Joe had informed Santa several weeks earlier that he would be in India!



The children were awake as we sneaked into their room and Joe hastily opened all his stocking gifts. The girls, in true teenage style, woke, a little grumpy and had to be cajoled into sharing Joe’s enthusiasm. Joe demolished most of the edible contents of his stocking before 9am.



Presents were exchanged and we all dressed for breakfast. Breakfast was a buffet of Indian delights, paratha, vegetable curry, sambal and roti. The children had porridge and juice.



We met Vijay at 11am and drove to the Maharanga Fort, the amazing Blue fort which overlooks Jodhpur. We spent 3 wonderful hours meandering through the fort, dazzled by the beauty within its battlements.<span> A trio of men in traditional Rajasthan costume played drums and wind instruments as we entered through the great gates, their skills complementing the atmosphere of the moment.



Up the cobbled path we climbed and entered into the museum which was filled with treasures from the Maharajas’ life in the palace. Amazing jewels lined the rooms, the bed-chamber being lined with glass baubles over the ceiling. The floor was intricately decorated marble but looked like a fine Persian rug.

Joe was especially interested in the armoury, surprise, surprise!



After a lovely day at the Fort we spent the rest of the day at the hotel. Determined to claim that we had swum on Christmas day. The water was icy cold but we all managed a brief swim before warm showers. The simple things in life are infinitely more apparent when travelling!



Christmas day evening as spent in Jodhpur, visiting the bazaar and having dinner on a roof top restaurant with Vijay. The fort overlooked the restaurant and was lit up.<span> It was an amazing place to spend Christmas evening and we all savoured the moment.



After visiting a spice shop and buying some recommended Masala mix we headed back to the hotel for a restful night sleep, or so we thought.

At around 2am a coach party of teenagers arrived and for the next hour enthusiastically ‘settled’ in to their new hotel.<span> We were not amused.<span> After complaining again to the manager we were promised an up grade, which we duly got the next day.

Old Town Jodhpur
Geo: 26.2816, 73.0232

Last day in Jodhpur. We went to a tea tasting and although I am not a big tea lover there were some delicious ones among them. Ended up buying some, space in my backpack permitting 😉 Then our time exploring Jodhpur together was over and we said goodbye, with Rika taking a train down south and me taking another one up north to Delhi. On the overnight train, while trying to sleep in the noisy overcrowded berth I watched several mice in vain checking out our bags for edible stuff 😊

Letzter Tag in Jodhpur. Wir gingen zu einer Teeverkostung. Und obwohl ich nicht gerade ein Teeliebhaber bin, waren dort eine Menge koestlicher Teesorten. Natuerlich kaufte ich ein paar Packungen am Ende, zumindest soviel wie ich in meinen Rucksack hineinzwaengen konnte 😉 Dann war unsere gemeinsame Entdeckungsreise in Jodhpur vorbei und es hiess mal wieder Auf Wiedersehen. Rika nahm einen Zug weiter Richtung Sueden und ich stieg in den Nachtzug, der mich noerdlich von hier nach Delhi bringen sollte. Waehrend ich im lauten und ueberfuellten Schlafabteil versuchte Schlaf zu finden, beobachtete ich wie mehrere Maeuse vergeblich versuchten an essbare Sachen in unseren Taschen zu kommen 😉

December 1st 2012
Published: December 1st 2012


Red Wattled Lapwing
Our visit to Ranthambhore was planned suddenly barely a week in advance. On making prior enquiries and search on the internet we came to know that the Safari Bookings are done on the website 90 days in advance and only a certain quota is made available for current booking. We were unsure as to whether we will be able to get the booking or not but decided to try our luck and reached Jaipur on November 13, 2012 at 5 pm.Day 1 - November 14, 2012 We left Jaipur at around 7.30 in the morning and reached our hotel at Ranthambhore “Tiger Machan Resort” around 11.45 am. As soon as we entered the resort I enquired about safari booking and got to know that the visitors have to personally go to the booking window with original ID proof and do the booking. For 2 pm safari the booking window opens at 12.30 pm and we were advised that since
Bank Myna
people start forming the queue as early as 10 am we simply completed the check-in formalities and rushed immediately to the booking office. We had selected the Resort being just about 2 kms away from the main entrance to the Tiger Reserve, however, the booking office was about 20 minutes drive from the resort. On reaching there we saw that there were 2 different queues for Gypsy Safari (6 people other than guide and driver) and Canter Safari (16-20 people other than guide and driver). Our preference was obviously for the Gypsy Safari and there were hardly about 7-8 people in the queue whereas for the Canter Safari there were more than 50 people. After being in the queue for about one and half hours we managed to get the booking and were thrilled. We rushed back to the resort to have quick lunch. Gypsy came to the resort for pick up and we set going. <br style=""color:

This is where I had the first gut feeling that ‘something is going wrong’. As I had felt, it took about 45 minutes for us to reach to the entrance to zone 8. As any visitor would do, we entered the zone with high expectations but to sum up the experience I can only say that the whole experience was highly disappointing. This zone 8 was a very short safari and ended after barely travelling for about half an hour from entry point. We could hardly see any wildlife (obviously no tiger sighting). We came to know that this zone was newly created and those who do last minute booking for Gypsy Safari during peak season are given only zone 8. The canters go in the zones 1 –
Photo 5
5 even for current booking. Now we realised as to why there was a long queue for canter booking. We returned highly disappointed with a resolution that next day morning we will go only in canter so as to get booking in one of the main zones i.e. 1 - 5. The evening turned out to be a bit eventful. We were resting in our tent and going through the day’s photographs when we started hearing a loud call of some animal and the people started shouting tiger . . .tiger . . .tiger. We rushed out of our tent. It was quite dark outside and people were running to one corner of the resort. The loud call of the animal continued and we were quite thrilled that we may be able to sight a tiger. On reaching to the spot we noticed that the people were throwing torch light in the direction from where the call was coming and we spotted a huge Nilgai howling in pain. Some of the resort
Large Grey Babbler
staff informed us that they saw a tiger who was chasing this Nilgai and the Nilgai was howling because the tiger had badly injured its leg. The tiger had run away seeing people had got alerted. The bewildered Nilgai continued to howl for almost 15 minutes and then dragged towards the jungle. The hotel manager later informed us that they were showing this news on ETV that the tiger was spotted near Tiger Machan Resort. Day 2 – November 15, 2012 Booking window for morning safari opens at 5.30 am so we got up at 3 am (our enthusiasm was such that the morning chill could not dampen our spirit) and were in queue at 4 am. After being in queue for about 3 hours we finally got the ticket in zone 1. I was thinking in my mind that the happiness of getting a ticket is probably more than the joy we will get if we were
Large Grey Babbler
able to sight a tiger. We hurried back to the resort just to pick up my camera and drove back to the main entry point to board the canter. Since we were getting late we had informed the canter driver that he need not come for pick up at the resort and instead we will meet him at the main entry point. Zone 1 turned out to be much better and though we could not sight a tiger we sighted other wildlife such as Nilgai, Spotted Deers, Sambhars, Wild Boar and plenty of birds. The safari was longer as compared to zone 8 and we returned back happy. We were very clear in our mind that though the main aim is to sight a tiger we will also enjoy the scenic beauty of the jungle and whatever other wild life we get to see. This clarity of mind enabled us to enjoy the visit which the other co-travellers were not enjoying and were cribbing that they could not sight a tiger. <br

This time I managed to do some setting and jumped the queue and got the ticket within an hour (I normally don’t ever do this but having been in the queue for 3 hours in the morning was not prepared to go through the same again). This time we got ticket to zone 4. Rushed back to the resort for quick lunch and were ready for the canter pick up at our resort. Zone 4 turned out to be the “bestest” of all the zones we visited. Absolutely scenic jungle and plenty of water bodies in this zone and this safari was the longest we took. Spotted a lot of birds and other wild life including a crocodile and
Pied Myna
a baby crocodile. This was our last safari and though we could not sight a tiger we were happy. Day 3 – November 16, 2012. We set out at sun rise for a visit to Ranthambhore Fort. We were informed that many times tigers have been spotted on the way to the Fort also and we were wishing that at least now we should sight a tiger. Our wish was not fulfilled. Ranthambhore Fort situated in the Aravali Mountain Range is comparatively in good condition and has a vast expanse. From the top we could get absolutely beautiful view of zones 3 and 5. Here also we spotted plenty of birds and returned back to the resort around 10 am since we had to now travel further to Bharatpur.<br style=""color:

By our last morning in Pushkar, we realized we were residing more than traveling. I guess that is what happens when you spend 10 days in the same place. The owner of one of the cafes in the camel section of the fair called us by our first names, the residents near our campsite said hello to us each morning and each evening as we trekked back and forth to the fair and one person asked us directions and inquired if we lived in Pushkar.

We saw a lot of interesting scenes at the fair. These photos do not even come close to demonstrating them all.

Ajmer Express
Up early to catch the 6 am Ajmer Shatabdi Express and one step closer to getting to the Pushkar Camel Fair. Despite our meticulous planning and preparation, our morning started off rocky.

We raced around the train station and ticket offices like an episode of The Amazing Race only to discover what we suspected all along...we were the latest targets of an Indian scam. In the Delhi train station, the thing to know is: never show your ticket to anyone, trust no one, talk to no one, there is no tourist tax, and there is no need for a boarding pass.

From worrying we were not going to get on our train to actually sitting in the seats, we had quite a trying morning...all before the sun came up!

The train ride was almost 7 hours and a bit like being on a plane in that we were served tea and snacks and given newspapers. We were in first class ($18/person) which made all the difference in the world for comfort and amentities. However, even the restrooms in first class were simply open pipes that spread the waste as the train rolled down the tracks!

We traveled
Our home for now
through agricultural communities, saw harvest crews and finally reached the desert in Ajmer. Without issue, we left the train station with our driver and drove through the chaos of Ajmer. We passed the sacred lakes and passed through the mountains to Pushkar...also known to us as the Camel Promise Land...

October 30th 2012
Published: October 30th 2012


Vandaag was een echte reisdag, en een saaie bovendien. De afstand tussen Jaipur en Jodhpur is niet groot maar de weg heel slecht en de bus is ook niet bepaald high-tech dus het ging allemaal erg traag. We zijn van 08.30u tot 19.00u onderweg geweest om een afstand van zo’n 250km te overbruggen. Het landschap was niet bijzonder boeiend, we reden de hele rit door een soort van droog steppe/semi-savannah gebied, niet echt woestijn maar er was niet veel meer dan een eentonig graslandschap te zien met hier en daar een struik of boom en af en toe een paar boerderijen of een slaperig dorpje. Er waren onderweg enkele fotomomenten met de lokale bevolking maar deze maakten de lange rit niet goed. Ik ben er wel achtergekomen wat de ´oplossing´ is als een local bezwaart maakt tegen fotograferen: dan maak je alsnog de foto die je wilt maken en geef je vervolgens een ruime fooi als genoegdoening. Hierna wil betreffende local vaak zelfs poseren. Dit alles onder het motto 'everything is possible in India´ -- soms moet je er alleen wat rupees voor over hebben. Moreel gezien enigszins twijfelachtig maar onze reisbegeleider had er geen moeite mee om hierin voorop te gaan.

Omdat we vrij laat aankwamen in het hotel en dit nog iets buiten de stad ligt hebben we in het hotel zelf een voornamelijk vegetarisch buffet gegeten, met o.a. bloemkoolsoep , spinazie en (gekruide) aardappels (India is het grootste vegetarische land ter wereld want heel veel Hindu’s, Jains en Sikhs eten op religieuze gronden geen vlees; vegetarische maaltijden zijn hier niet te vermijden). Het hotel is weer een voormalig paleis (Prince Charles en Camilla hebben hier ook overnacht), hoewel wat minder over-the-top ingericht dan het vorige. In dit geval sliep ik in één van de luxere kamers.

DSCF8221
Planty's version



Our first few hours in Jaipur were spent having an orientation walk, basically showing us around the market area and the different things the city had to offer. We headed out in my new favourite thing, the tuk tuk, so cheap, so basic, but they're brilliant, they get you to your destination so quickly, nipping through the tightest gaps in the traffic with ease. As we walked through the streets you could feel everyone turning to look at you, especially the blonde girls on our trip, we were basically aliens, people looking with confusion, not being able to understand what we were and why we were there. We passed a large bin that had overflowed into the street and witnessed a cow, a dog and a pig all helping themselves to the contents, which looked like a group of guys munching their kebabs waiting for a taxi at half 4 on a Sunday morning struggling to stand up due the severe intoxicated state that they’re in.



Once we had our small tour, which included crossing a few roads, I though crossing roads in Marrakech was an achievement, but this was even scarier, we
DSCF8225
headed for the local cinema to watch the latest Bollywood film, I wasn't too sure if I wanted to go, but went along with everyone else. I was astounded by the cinema, a massive pink building, and inside it was pretty much the same, over, pink walls with huge ornate decorations that made up the walls of each screen room. The film started and I had no idea what was going on, every now and then, while the actors are midway through a conversation or scene, they spurt out a couple of English words, but as the film progressed, we figured out that it was all the derogatory phrases, like 'bitch' and 'stupid whore', basically all the words that I don't think have a Hindu translation. I've always imagined Bollywood films to have a cheesy story line, and then randomly burst into the most over the top song and dance scene with everyone grinning like they’re being individually held at gun point and have no other alternative, but I was wrong. The story was about a top actress in Bollywood who was at the height of her career, and a guy who used her to enhance his career, he then
DSCF8229
binned her off and the film told the story of her rise to fame again, eventually she got back to the top of her career and ruined his at the same time by releasing a private sex tape they had made, pretty intense compared to what the common sense stereotypical assumptions of what Bollywood was all about.



We all left the cinema quite impressed and overwhelmed by what we had just watched, all with the same confusion, where was the random songs? The cheesy smile? And the even cheesier script? We went to a nearby restaurant for our evening dinner, while one of the girls had a cigarette outside, me and Lotty waited with her, we didn't want her to be on her own outside a restaurant in a country she was unfamiliar with. As ever we had someone come over and try and sell us something, this time it was puppets, that looked like a hyena had painted them whilst laughing hysterically, I told him no thanks twice, then got into a slight conversation with him which went like this........



Planty: Do you speak English?

Local: Yes I speak English

Planty:
DSCF8230
Do you understand the meaning of words though?

Local: Yes

Planty: Do you know what the word 'no' means?

Local: 'N' 'O', 'no', yes I know what this word means

Planty: So why when I've already said no to you twice do you still proceed to ask me to buy the same thing off you that I've said 'no' to?



He didn't have an answer to that, so we went inside, and began what to seem like our tour of the restaurant as the staff tried to find an area where 15 of us could be seated. As we at down I was informed that this was a vegetarian restaurant, which wasn't the greatest thing to tell a starving meat eater like myself, then I decided to scan the menu and have a beer, but no! This restaurant didn't serve beer either?! What kind of place was I in? No meat, no beer? I was hungry, I'd had a long day all I wanted was meat and beer. Still, I got over this issue and witnessed another funny incident that we were all talking about later that night, Richard, the guy from Australia
DSCF8231
on our group went to order a drink, and once again, this is how it went.........



Waiter: What would like drink? (the waiter had a basic English so missed a few words out there)

Richard: I'll have a kingfisher please

Waiter: Sorry, no kingfisher

Richard: Oh, I'll just have a water then

Waiter: Coke?

Richard: No, water

Waiter: Diet coke?

Richard: No, water

Waiter: Coke light?

Richard: Yeah, whatever....



After the slight language barrier we managed to even order our food with out getting deep fried frog testicles and although the food was all vegetarian, it was really good, and different from what we had eaten in Delhi and Agra. Me and Lotty shared a Thali, which is like a platter, sampling a few different curries and local dips and sauces, and we ordered a Roti, which is similar to a large pancake with a filling. I had mentioned to the group and on here that one of the reasons I wanted to come to India was to try the food, and it's nice to try all the different regional foods because they're mostly different
DSCF8232
in the spice and flavours and the ways the food is presented.



We got back to the hotel and our guide had bought a bottle of whiskey and invited us to have a few drinks if we wanted, being partial to the odd drink we accepted, along with the majority of the group. We went to our room and got our bottle of Blueberry, Pomegranate and Acai flavoured vodka to share with everyone. At Luton airport we got a bottle of Raspberry vodka and polished it off in 3 days, so decided to buy another and hadn't touched it. We all gathered around a couple of tables with our drinks and had a nice chat with the others, although the dinners were good for a chat, you could only speak to people opposite or next to you, but this was a good chance to get to know the people more, we had a great time and shared stories of our past holidays, home towns and other stuff that sounds interesting after a few drinks, it was probably all crap though.



The next morning we had yet another busy day ahead and once more we
DSCF8234
headed out in our small group of tuk tuk's to the Amber fort, basically another sort of monument. As we pulled over to the side of the road, some of the group stopped to have a photo taken with an elephant, we had one taken too which was pretty cool. After that I heard the dreaded sound of a snake charmers trumpet sort of thing start about 10 metres away from us, as some mental guy casually pulled a basket from his bag and started charming a cobra. As ever, me being a massive wimp and terrified of snakes, I ran away, probably with the rest of the group laughing at me in the process, as they had discovered how much of a big tart I am when it comes to these disgustingly pointless and limbless creatures. We headed over to the bottom of the Amber Fort to wait for our elephant ride to the main gate (another different form of transport) and waited in the blistering heat while being harassed by all sorts of locals trying to sell stuff, and as I sometimes like the odd joke, this, again, is how a conversation went with one of them........
DSCF8238



Local: You want nice set of pens?

Planty: No, I can't write mate.

Local: Maybe nice presents for friend?

Planty: No mate, I don't have any friends.

Local: How about a gift for your girlfriend?

Planty: No, she doesn't deserve one, she's rubbish at making bacon butties.



By this point, I think our fellow travellers had began to understand my delightful sense of humour and what to expect over the remainder of our tour. While we waited in the queue for our elephant, I heard the unmistakable sound of a typical brit abroad, and unfortunately for me, it was a Cockney, my most hated breed of people, and there was 2 of them, a guy and a woman. The guy was doing the usual brit thing and talking at a local at a million miles an hour, while the local wasn't understanding a single word of it, or caring for that matter, like the entirety of Jaipur for that matter. We climbed onto our elephants for our ride up the hill, the elephant was rather big really, but then again, it's not going to be a small creature. As our
DSCF8239
newest mode of transport plodded up the hill, I felt rather sorry for the poor elephant up ahead of us that was carrying 2 typical Americans, and when I say typical I mean fat, or more precisely, obese and lazy, the poor elephant must have been in so much pain having to carry these 2 lard arse's up a hill. We got to the top and regrouped while we waited for our guide, all noticing the previously mentioned brit's abroad walking around the fort as if they where on a holiday in the costa del sol, him with hist vest and shorts, her with a hideous gold bikini. I know it wasn't a fashion parade, but you’re in a historic landmark, have some respect and at least cover your bingo wings and post pregnancy belly. People like that really make me ashamed to be English sometimes, and society blames the younger generation for having a lack of respect, not in this scenario.



After spending an hour or so walking around the fort, we headed for the exit to wait for everyone else, then all of a sudden, I heard a sound, the most terrifying sound I have
DSCF8244
ever witnessed, a snake charmer! I peered slowly around the corner to one dancing around and people taking photo's with them, and as I pride myself on my high level of intelligence, and the fact that I'm not a complete moron, I stayed away. The snake was put away, and then 2 more appeared from another box, again I watched from a safe distance of approximately 7 lightyears away. We all saw a mental couple sit on the floor opposite the snakes as one escaped and made its way quite quickly over to one of the people, who looked like they had just filled a nappy with a not so pleasant smelling semi-solid substance. Typically with snake charmers, the cobra was simply grabbed by the tail and flung back in the box like a prisoner who had just escaped beyond the boundaries of a maximum security prison.



I was quite happy when we left the fort, partly because I didn't find it interesting, and partly because I couldn't wait to get away from the snakes. As ever, our tuk tuk drivers waited outside to ferry us off to the next location on our itinerary. In Jaipur, one
DSCF8245
of the tuk tuk's had a massive speaker system on the back shelf (usually where bags are stored) and a custom fitted CD player, due to this, he earned the nickname of 'party tuk'. We were lucky enough to be passengers in the party tuk for the next short leg of our tour of Jaipur, again, whizzing in and out of traffic with the latest UK chart hits blasting out while local people look on in utter disgust. We stopped at the side of the road to take photo's of camels if we wanted to, but I couldn't be arsed, and as we climbed back in to carry on down the road, our driver, who is a fair spoons short of a cutlery set, asked if I would like to drive. Obviously, me being sensible, and the fact that India's roads are not the safest ones to drive on, I declined his offer politely, only to be persuaded by Lotty to have a go, so I did. I was a bit scared at first, driving on Indian roads was never a thing I would want to do, but I was having fun, although I got asked by the driver to
DSCF8247
slow down, I was confused by this, an Indian driver telling someone to slow down? They Don't know how to drive slow, I wasn't even going that fast, or at least I didn't think I was. The highlight of driving a tuk tuk was overtaking an elephant on the road, I don't think many people can say they've done that before.



Once I enjoyed my 5 minutes of fun on Indian roads, I let the driver take over and carry on our journey. The girls decided they wanted to a bit of shopping, and the guys reluctantly agreed to join them, one the my biggest regrets to date. Lotty loves shopping in the UK but restricts herself due to the prices back home, but in India clothes are horrendously cheap, but brilliant quality, so as one would expect, this took a few hours. Our guide had mentioned about local shopkeepers and workers engaging in conversation with us, asking where we are from, what we do for a living etc, something which I took in mind when I decided to let my humorous side come out to play yet again. In one of the shops that I spent
DSCF8261
a near eternity in, one of the guys started talking to me, I told him where I was from and when he asked what I do for a living, I decided I was a helicopter pilot, the guy looking impressed asked if I'm in the army or if I'm a soldier (which I thought was basically the same thing), but I just insisted I fly helicopters for the rich and famous, all the while having to stop myself from smiling and laughing about it.



As we finally left the shops the group decided to head back to the hotel, via a shop to buy a plentiful supply of beer and sit on the roof terrace for a few hours and consume our beloved beverages. This one of the highlights of our India trips so far because as previously mentioned, the only time we got to sit and talk, was at dinner, it was nice once again to relax, talk and have a good time, and of course, the beer was extremely cheap.



Later we headed out for our evening meal which was becoming my favourite time of the day, as most of you will
DSCF8272
know by know I love curry, and eating it in India is the best to have it. We made it to the restaurant after yet another episode of near misses with car's people, cows and coaches, which was my excuse to have another beer. I'd love to be able to tell you what I had to eat, but because I've had a continents worth of different curries, I can't remember, the only thing I do remember, was everyone laughing at me once more, when my 'family naan' arrived, because it was big enough to feed a family, hence the name. With a belly full of curry and beer (again) we crashed out for the night ready for another fun filled day, this trip was getting better and better.



The next morning we were on the move once more, this time our destination was Pushkar, which is a small religious town that has a lake where people go to die, not the most pleasant thing to hear first thing in the morning during our quick brief of the day. Our mode of transport was another coach, only it was India's version of Ryanair without wings, the legroom was
DSCF8273
poor, even a dwarf would have struggled, one of the windows was missing and had been replaced by some wood. Our 2 hour painful journey was made better by the colourful sights of India, and there where hundreds on the way to Pushkar. As we trundled down some sort of motorway, we where overtaken by a guy on a motorbike, which seemed normal, only at second glance we noticed he had a goat facing backwards in a pouch next to the bike, like a sidecar without wheels. We also saw hundreds of cows relaxing either in the central reservation or taking up a lane or 2 of the motorway, which all other road users thought was normal and simply drove around them. We stopped halfway to grab some drinks and use the toilet, but our guide warned us not to leave our bags on the coach, because if the locals don't take them, the monkeys will. This place gets better and better.



We got to Pushkar a few hours later to be briefed once more about the town, the hotel and the optional actives during our stay. As always, our guide was full of knowledge about the
DSCF8278
area, and also informed us that no meat or alcohol was allowed. I thought this was a joke, I'd already had to deal with this situation in Jaipur, but that was one meal, this was a couple of days, although we'd just arrived, I wanted to leave Pushkar. After dropping our bags at the room, we met for lunch in the hotel restaurant, I opted for a 'palak paneer', because I thought the second word reminded me of 'pioneer'. As we waited for our food to be cooked, we all made a joke about the dreaded green curry I had in Agra, I even said at one point “I bet this one's blue”, while everyone else joined in making similar remarks. Our food swiftly arrived, to my sheer horror, my curry was once again, bright green, I thought this was some sort of sick joke that someone had played on me, the whole table was laughing at me and my curry, I was so upset. The curry was a spinach based one with huge lumps of cottage cheese, not what you expect from a curry, so I had a couple of mouthfuls and left the rest, I couldn't stomach eating
DSCF8281
anymore.



After my terrifying ordeal with lunch, a few of us took advantage of the hotel pool, although it wasn't the cleanest pool I've ever been in. As I stood in the pool, I couldn't see my feet at the bottom, and not to worry ourselves, the other guys on our group decided there was too much chlorine in the pool, nothing else, but we agreed it didn't look like a pool where you'd put your head under the water. After a couple of hours of enjoying the sun and the pool, we got ready for the evening, a camel ride into the back and beyond of Pushkar, sounded great if you enjoy camel rides, which I don't. On our summer holiday to Tunisia in 2010, Lotty had convinced me to go on a 2 day trip into the sahara desert which included a 3 hour camel trek. I had problems walking for a few hours after that camel trek and didn't want to ever experience it again, but it was either that or stay in the alcohol free hotel on my own, so, dressed in traditional Indian clothes, and sporting the worlds biggest turban, coincidently the
DSCF8282
biggest in our group, we set off.



I was bored after about 5 minutes, and the guy holding my camel wasn't exactly full of conversation, apart from when he pointed at a lake and said “Pushkar lake”, state the obvious why don't you mate. As we painfully plodded on, going further and further into the wilderness, the camel in-front of me kept farting a pooing like there was no tomorrow, the terrible smells kept wafting in my face. We eventually stopped for 10 minutes, which gave me a chance to get the blood flowing in my painful genitals, and set off again for a while until we got to our 'restaurant'. Our evening meal was to served in a sandy field on rickety old plastic benches by a bunch of gypsies. While the food was being prepared, the women performed a local dance for us, and the asked us to join in, I declined the offer only to see one of them, about 4ft 8, sprint towards me and basically leapfrog the table to try and drag me up, but I managed to slip away quite strategically.



The food was served a short time
DSCF8283
later and for vegetarian food it was okay, quite spicy and there was loads of it, I'd finish one plate and the guy's who had cooked it came and filled my plate again and again. For our trip back to the hotel we had 2 options for transport, camels or jeep's, thankfully, everyone opted for the jeep's. We climbed into a couple of vehicles which looked like they'd only just survived the Vietnam war and headed back to the hotel. I was sat in the back of the jeep holding on for dear life as we shot through the narrow roads, avoiding cows, dogs and people in the pitch black. We made it back to the hotel in one piece, and headed to bed ready for an early start the next morning.



Our next day started at 8:30, we walked down to Pushkar lake for a quick tour, and watched one as a few of the group took part in a ritual by the lakeside. The lake is sacred and no shoes are to be warn within 40ft of it, which wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to constantly avoid, cow, dog and bird poo
DSCF8286
all over the floor. From there, we headed to a local restaurant for breakfast and then on to a nearby temple. As we were given a quick intro about the history and use of the temple, I noticed a small crowd gathering around us, this was becoming a regularity, locals seemed intrigued by us, just listening to what we were being told and curious about westerners in general. Temple tour done, the day was ours, we were free to do as we wished. Slowly walking back to the hotel in the midday sun, Lotty and one of the other girls stopped at every shop on the way back, for a look around while I was getting hot, bored and needed a cold drink. Eventually back at the hotel, we headed for the pool once more, enjoying the heat of Pushkar for a few hours.



We had been told about an event in the town called 'tourist day', and told that if we wanted to see it, to meet by the lake at 16:30. As we'd lazed around for a few hours doing nothing, we headed down and made ourselves comfortable in a restaurant right on the street,
DSCF8287
ready for the parade. Not long after we arrived, the parade started, people dancing, playing drums, setting fireworks off and having a good time right in-front of us. The parade lasted for about an hour and was really good, it was nice to see that people of Pushkar had put on this parade for tourists, which only takes place once a year, so we where in Pushkar at the perfect time.



After the parade we made a quick stop at the hotel to freshen up and get ready for dinner. The restaurant was different from the traditional ones we'd been eating in, this one had a couple of sitting areas set up on a step with lots of cushions, basically to relax while enjoying your food. We watched another Bollywood film while we waited for, and ate our food, a new film called 'Delhi Belly'. It's similar to the recent film 'The Hangover', everyone loved it, it was hilarious, I was again surprised by a Bollywood film, the one we watched in Jaipur was okay, but this one was amazing.



Our stay in Pushkar was over, the next morning we headed for Udaipur, a
DSCF8288
town that our guide is very familiar with as he spent a lot of his younger years there and knew the area very well. We piled into Jeep’s for a trip to the next city called Ajmer to catch our coach. I was shocked at how busy the city was to drive through, I'd never even heard of Ajmer, but it was by far the most chaotic one we'd driven through so far. We got to our coach without a problem, apart from the guy who slightly crashed his motorbike into the back our Jeep because he was looking at us westerners and not at the road, silly man. Our coach was a sleeper coach, the area that normally holds bags above the seats, has beds for long journeys, we had been warned that the coach will stop and pick up a lot more passengers on the way, which will try and sit on your seat too, but kindly tell them to sod off.



The coach itself was rather good by Indian standards, the seats where large with good legroom and had a standard semi-recline position. As we knew we had another 7-8 hours to endure, I
DSCF8292
put on my I-pod and sat there watching the world go by. About halfway into our journey, the coach was quite full, I'd been intelligent and sat at a seat which had a ladder to get up to the beds next to it, so no-one could try and sit on my seat or arm rest. Unfortunately for the Aussie guy on our group sat just in-front of me, he ended up with someone sat on his arm rest, and an old lady sat on the floor half under his legs. I found this quite funny as a short time before, someone was sick out of the window above which came in through their window, covering his wife’s seat, so he had his wife leaning on him on one side, and an Indian guy sat on his arm rest, all the while I was making fun of his situation.



Lotty's version;

Our next stop was Jaipur. After settling in, having a wash and some food (I managed to mix it up abit and have chips with my curry!) we went for a walk around the old city. Jaipur is nicknamed 'the pink city' because in 1876 the
DSCF8294
old town was painted pink to welcome the prince of Wales, it is still maintained today. Jaipur is even more crazy, just when you think nothing else suprises you a camel strolls past, or even an elephant! I just can't describe the sights, smells and sounds. Try to imagine a cow a pig and a dog all eating from a pile of rubbish on the floor, bizzare but smelly. Add in the constant beeping of horns, some background Indian music and people everywhere shouting and trying to sell you things. Then add some spice shops which smell of fresh chillis and masala and you have an idea of what we are experiencing.

We wandered through the old town and then got cycle rickshaws to the cinema to watch a bollywood film. The rickshaw is a new, not very comfortable experience for us, but I guess we were more comfortable than the guy cycling! After some near misses and loads of people staring at us we arrived at the cinema. The film we had come to see is the newest release called Heroine, its about a bollywood actress and her turbulent relationships with work and men and apparently based on
DSCF8298
a true story. I was suprised by it as it wasn't how I expected bollywood to be, it was serious, explicit and dark. Furthermore I've never seen someone cry so much in one film! Seriously I just wanted to shake her, she was a nutter! The best part was possibly the audience. They were wolf whistling and cheering. What was strange though was the number of screaming kids and mobile phones ringing in the cinema!

Afterwards we went for dinner. We had previously believed £10 for a meal and beers to be cheap, here we had 3 cokes, a masala roti (a big filled pancake) and a huge thali and it came to £4.80. It was amazing food to. Returning to our hotel ready for bed our guide proclaimed he had a bottle of whiskey and anyone was welcome to join for a nightcap. We had a bottle of pomegranate, Acai berry and blueberry absolut from the airport, he got the hotel to open the shop so we could get some lemonade and needless to say, we didn't get an early night.

Next morning we arose bright an early for a day sightseeing in Jaipur. We had a
DSCF8301
tuktuk for the whole day, to run us around costing around £5! Our first stop, the amber fort was built in 1592 using financial gains made from war plundering. An impressive mix of sandstone and marble it served as a palace and the insides are intricately carved and adorned with artwork. It had an amazing view and all around was a wall that wouldn't look out of place in a picture of china! The highlight however had to be the journey up there. We rode up on elephants. They are so beautiful with their big sad eyes I fell in love immediately! It took us about 45 minutes to get our elephants, however the endless hawkers vs planty provided all the entertainment we required! I spent the time in stitches at the cocky, smart ass comments to the sellers that were persistent and irritating to be polite. We got on our elephant from a platform. They were all brightly painted with a flat seat on the top for us. We headed up, the scenary was amazing, like a film set. Unfortunatly two elephants infront were a pair of typical Brits abroad. The guy topless and girl in a bikini they
DSCF8302
were loud and obnoxious, obviously the boarding gate for India was next to the one for benidorm in the airport they flew from! After being covered in elephant snot from her trunk and told by the elephant man we didn't give a big enough tip (10% wasn't enough apparently) we thanked our elephant and went to explore the fort. Here we wittnessed what we had been forewarned about, the Indians love of the British. We had seen them stare and take pictures on the sly, on our rickshaw journey the previous night I had resorted to a queen wave because that's how I felt! In the fort a group came up to us ""aww you English? Please can we have photo with you?"" Planty began protesting but in the end it was easier to agree, so somewhere in India there is a picture of us with a few locals!

Another highlight occured on the way down when planty saw the snake charmers. I thought it was funny anyway, he's such a pansy! we then left the fort for dinner, in the way out we were bombarded with the usual touts and hawkers, each carrying the same bloody carved elephants
DSCF8304
and sparkly pens and each offering them for around 10p! Another common sight are women with babies begging for money to buy food for their babies. we were hassled by a pair so badly one of the girls gave in and gave them a banana, to this one of the woman shook her head and said ""no my baby needs money"", not a substantial foodstuff if you ask me! We had started walking up to our tuktuks when we realised two of the party were missing. We turned round to see them marching towards us pied piper style with half of Indias hawkers in tow. They are the most enthusiastic out of all of us for shopping and the sight of them being hounded by so many was quite funny. As the sellers swarmed us they were bundled into a tuk tuk and we were off!

Our tuktuk driver was hillarious, he had a huge speaker system wired up in the back of his tuktuk and was BLASTING the latest uk chart hits. At one point he pulled over and turned to planty and told him it was his turn to drive, possibly the most nerve wracking part of
DSCF8312
India so far, however we came out of it unschathed! After a curry buffet for lunch we were told it was time to go to the museum. Having seen enough history for the day there was a collective agreement to sacrifice the museum and go shopping! First off was a visit to a textile factory. Indias tourist trap, We had seen this before in the form of a carpet factory in turkey and papayrus factory in Egypt. I was made to get up and be dressed in a sari. I hate getting up Infront of people, It scares me to death. However I got up and a particularly smelly Indian man proceeded to wrap me in 6 meters of purple fabric adorned with silver elephants while people took photographs! I was quite excited about sari shopping in India, however I definitely cannot remember how to put it on! The one I tried wasn't particularly beautiful, however most that you see are. The ladies put so much effort into their dress and the saris are beautiful and colourful.

After our sari excitement came shopping, some amazingly cheap scalves and hippie pants later the decision was made (more enthusiastically by the
DSCF8317
males in our group) to go and get some beer and sit on the particularly nice roof terrace of the hotel. By the time we left for dinner I think we were more ready for bed! After a particularly spicy creation we returned back to the hotel, packed and still had time for a luxurious 8 hour sleep!

The next day we were up handy for a bus journey to pushkar. Our transport appears to be degrading each time. We went from a train to a coach to this, with skanky curtains, missing windows and seats that have seen better days, Plantys face was a picture when he saw it! Still there was no goats or chickens on it, and we were sat inside and not on the roof so it could always be worse! The thing about India is just when you think you've seen it all it turns round and informs you that you haven't. On this journey we saw a cow, stood calmly chewing the cud in the middle of the highway as lorries and buses swerve to avoid her. This isn't normal to us, but after the last few days we are not really phased
DSCF8319
by it, however a while later we passed a man trundling along on a moped, with a goat, calmly sat in a bag on the back of it.... Only in India!

We were told the highway was good, apart from 5km on the way into pushkar. It was difficult to determine where this started and i think there may have been a printing error and they missed the 0 off 50km. Therefore after a particularly bumpy ride and some very near misses, we arrived in Pushkar. The home of the biggest animal market in Asia and one of only a few Brahma temples making it a prominent Hindu pilgrimage town. Unfortunatly this also meant the town is strictly vegetarian and no alcohol is allowed! Our bus navigated sharp bends, mopeds, camels, wild pigs and cows down an increasingly rustic dirt track until pulling up at our hotel. With an Indian meets colonial style, the hotel was complete with pool, mango trees and cornfields, it was beautiful and a relief because when we booked a ""basic"" trip with G adventures I dreaded the accomodation more than anything! We were greeted by a man giving us roses and told that we
DSCF8320
were to be upgraded as there was not enough normal rooms! Deluxe was nice, however remaining typically Indian in the fact that you couldn't get to the toilet without going through the shower and the power cut out about 5 times a day.

Our plan for the evening was simply to be dressed in authentic dress then take a sunset stroll into the desert on camel. I was excited about Sari wearing again.... However that soon waned when I was handed matching pink floral singlet and full skirt and a pink scarf edged with tinsel, local dress apparently! My horror lessened slightly however when I realised planty was wearing a turban! We were allocated camels. Mine ""Krishna"" was possibly the biggest camel I have ever seen in my life, he was huge! They are really healthy but slender here, not like the scabby fleabitten things we rode in Tunisia. They also look really graceful with their springy legs but maintain a goofy, comical air. They also have loads of personality which I quickly discovered when Krishna turned round and wiped his slobber all down my beautiful outfit!

Strolling through pushkar on my giant camel, waving at the kids
DSCF8321
who stop to say hello like we were something special I thought to myself I could get used to this. The camel has a springy gait and when they pick up speed they just spring a little more making it quite a comfy ride, like they have some sort of built in suspension. My day dreaming was shattered by my camel minion man flinging me the reins and running off into the bushes for a wee. My camel went from noble steed of the Maharajas to complete pain in the bum! He made a beeline to every piece of greenery, insisting on sampling every leaf, shoot and particularly thorny tree, dragging me through them in the process. I kicked, tugged on the reins and shouted, however we were going where the camel wanted and at his pace (which normally meant right up the bum of the camel infront!) after about two hours we stopped for dinner. Right in the middle of nowhere our camels were unsaddled and left to roll around in the sand we made our way up the hill to a few delapedated benches surrounded by cows and dogs. We were given soft drinks and crisps ad watched
DSCF8322
the animals play and the sun set.

When it went dark they lit a campfire and pulled out something that resembled a glow-worm attached to a gas canister which was lit and scarily sat on a wicker chair for height. Then some gypsy dancers appeared as entertainment. Some singing, dancing and a few refusals to get up later it was finally time to eat. Considering we were in the middle of nowhere and the only building was a concrete shell the food was fantastic! Curry, rice, naan and poppadums kept coming until we were stuffed! Then they carried on dancing. The last act was a fire eater. He was also brilliant, however sometimes a little close for comfort! For the journey back we were given the option of camel or jeep. I seemed to be the only taker for a camel ride in the pitch black so we were separated into two jeeps. Us ""young people"" were put in a vehicle with no windows or suspension, what it did have was a very loud cd player and quickly became dubbed the ""party jeep"" to the delight of our driver. All eleven of us hurtled along at breakneck speed getting
DSCF8336
covered in a layer of dust, music blaring, horn honking, it was possibly the best introduction to Pushkar you could have!

The next morning we were allowed to lie in until 8.30 then it was out for a walk of Pushkar, its main street is made up of bazaars and stalls selling clothes, food, spices, samuri swords.. But the main focus of the town is the lake. Surrounded by 52 ghats (bathing stations) each one is significant for gods appearing or for example Gandhi ghat is where Ghandis ashes are scattered. It is not the nicest looking religious artefact in India, infact i was relieved we were not allowed to go for a swim, if the ganges is the most polluted river in the world, this had to be a run off pool! After removing our shoes out of respect and dodging cow pats and other suspicious looking items we were given the option of receiving a blessing from a Brahman. I am not a religious person but understand and respect peoples reasons for their faith, and although Hinduism is fast becoming my favourite with their beliefs that all animals have souls and if you feed and look after
DSCF8338
the animals you have good karma. I just didn't feel comfortable with the idea of being blessed. Especially because of the devotion Hindus put into coming here. It just didn't feel right for me so I passed on the offer and chose to watch the others and discuss the rudeness of two people taking photos of a big group of locals we had been informed were praying for lost loved ones. Anyway, a short while later it was time for breakfast! I had lemon and sugar pancakes with a glass of freshly squeezed lemon juice which was like sorbet. The good thing about this trip is that our guide pickes places that have a good, safe reputation and although they cost a little more between planty and myself our food and drinks regularly fall around the £3-4 mark, even for curries and the trimmings! Its crazy. After breakfast we visited the famous Brahman temple, built entirely on donations it was neither spectacular or impressive, however adorning every surface was a carving to commemorate a loved one so it was quite a sad experience. Leaving the temple we wandered through the market, did some bartering, which I am terrible at here!
DSCF8339
I know you're supposed too but when an outragious price for him would feed his family for a week but for me its a few pound I feel like a terrible person! Anyway we meandered back to the hotel for a few hours of sunbathing by the pool and a quick dip in its slightly opaque waters.

After we headed back into town for front row seats to the yearly tourism festival. We ordered some chilli pakoras (Plantys choice) and sat and waited for the parade. There was music and dancers, we were all given garlands to wear and there were even some local celebrities; including the regions best camel! Animals and people were adorned with brightly coloured headdresses, intricately embroidered outfits and copious volumes of jewellery and they all performed and posed as the sunset over pushkar lake. Afterwards we made our way to where we were eating, tired but too hungry to miss. In the 'restaurant' we were sat in comfy circular structures and told if we wanted we could watch a bollywood movie whilst we ate. The film was ""Delhi belly"" and similar to ""the hangover"" in context. It was still not what I expected from
DSCF8341
a bollywood film, being hilarious and crude, I can't believe how it could be popular in such a seemingly conservative society. After the film it was straight to bed as we were leaving the hotel at 5am to hike up to the saraswati temple.

5am came around far to quickly, especially as planty had been up ill in the night. I left for the trek bleery eyed and without him. The 20 min walk to the base was actually around 45. By the time we had got there I was hungry and had a headache, we began our ascent, the path beginning as steps but too quickly becoming steep rocks. I was bright red, sweaty and couldn't breathe by the time we reached the summet. The view was pretty impressive and I was happy to sit and watch the sunrise, the monkeys squabbling and the dogs teasing them whilst I recovered. It was then we realized the amount of people photographing us. We had got used to it, the not so subtle stares and obvious waving of phones. I don't mind if they ask and had started turning away to be awkward if they didn't, however sat up on
DSCF8344
the summet I didnt care, infact I was satisfied that somewhere in India I would be sat looking sweaty and grumpy in somebodys pilgrimage to pushcar photo album! On our descent (which proved more tretcherous) I felt like a celebrity, everyone wants to shake your hand and have a picture with you. Also out of the market they had no ulterior motive, being in a group I felt safe to comply. We made our way back to the restaurant we were eating dinner in, I arrived first with another couple and it was all locked up, we stood for a minute waiting for the others when the guys neighbour came and started shouting and banging on the door to wake him up. He opened the door and we entered, in the corner on one if the tables was a pile blankets, obviously where he slept! I cannot get used to people sleeping like that but it is so common, if you walk round the hotel late at night all the staff are sleeping on the floor. Its so difficult to comprehend! We ate quickly by indian standards and then left to get back and pack. On the way back we
DSCF8354
stopped at a shop to get some water and snacks for the journey. We had heard horror stories about how beggers break their childrens limbs to make people feel sorry for them and the shopkeeper looked like he was a victim. His legs looked contorted and were not fully formed and he shuffled around on his bum. Although its a horrendous situation his determination and spirit was inspiring, he could so easily have been a begger on the street, but he was working and I was so impressed by him!

We left for Udaipur in jeeps, the journey was off the beaten track and then over a mountain road to the next town. The journey was hair raising to say the least, we had a motorbike go into the back of us because he was too busy staring and an impatiant truck overtaking us had a near miss on the other side of the road. As we entered into the town it only got worse. The most manic place we have seen so far there were clearly too many people and animals for the road. We made it to our bus which was to take us for the seven
DSCF8356
hour journey to Udaipur. From the outside it looked relatively new, however the inside was a different story. Our seats were massive, above our heads was sleeper cabins which apparently the locals cram into. There were no goats or chickens but it did serve as a local bus. We had assigned seats but they piled above our heads and into the isle. They again were staring and taking sly photos of us and didn't tire of it! The journey itself was dreadful. The whole bus vibrated and rattled down the new highway making doing anything- including sleeping impossible. I spent the whole time trying not to be sick, someone above us was sick down the window infront of us. If the locals are being sick imagine how our delicate western stomachs were feeling! We were kept going by the prospect of beer meat in our next destination!

Anneke's nieuwe mode
In de moskee in Delhi
Bij aankomst iIn Delhi werden we gelijk in de zeik genomen door taxichauffer, ons hotel zou niet te bereiken zijn door festival, hij wist de weg niet, we kregen de manager aan de lijn van ons hotel die dit bevestigde (gefaked) natuurlijk, daarna kon hij hotel niet vinden....ging hij zoeken in de achterbuurt en naar veel gezeur toch vlak bij ons hotel gedropt. Mooi begin om er niet gelijk in hun oplichtingspraktijken te vallen.

Dan blijkt de trein voor de komende dagen vol te zitten die je had willen nemen om Delhi uit te komen....alternatief is dus een prive toertje met chauffeur.

In Delhi sightseeing langs een mooi fort, (red fort), een van de grootste moskeeen van de wereld...hier mag je wel naarbinnen als buitenlander en nog wat highlights. Een ritje in de riksja over de makt en daarna konden we Delhi verlaten.

Vanaf hier toer naar Puskar (heilige plek voor hindu's ) Jaipur, tempels en forten, Agra...ja ook die Taj Mahal moet je maar even gezien hebben. In een paar dagen wel een overkill aan tempels en forten, daarnaast is het reizen ook gekkehuis door de drukte op straat, de smerigheid, iedereen die iets van je wil
sunset camel ride
2 uur over een asfalt weg heen en weer waarbij je kameel schrikt van het verkeer, dan toch een mini zandduintje gevonden voor de zonsondergang..heerlijk toeristisch
en wat het plaatje dan compleet maakt is die drukkende hitte, je weet wel zo vlak voordat het gaat onweren.....maar hier blijft dat gewoon dagen achter elkaar.

We zien natuurlijk ook veel mooie dingen, kleurrijke mensen, interessante rituelen (hindu's die hun verschillende goden vereren waaronder Ganesha, de olifant god) lekker eten, leuke ontmoetingen, en we zijn blij met de airco van onze taxi. De rijkunsten van onze chauffeur snappen we niet altijd, de meeste Indiers zijn goed in nog net even ergens een klein gaatje te vinden, maar die van ons gaat 30 rijden, midden op de snelweg als er niemand voor of achter hem is. Daarnaast is hij een beetje appart...maar hij brengt ons veilig van A naar B.

Toch zijn we blij als we zonder hem onze reis kunnen vervolgen. we pakken de nachttrein naar Varanasi (7 uur vertraging) In Varanasi cremeren de Hindu's hun overledenen en van elke uithoek nemen ze hun gestorven familileden mee om op de brandstapel te leggen. Aan de rand van de Ganges (heilige rivier) gaat de fik er in en vervolgens wordt hun as in de Ganges gestrooid. Hiermee zou deze persoon dus rechtstreeks in de hemel komen.

Als
making new friends
toerist krijg je dit allemaal te zien wandelend langs de rivier of vanaf een bootje. Elke avond is hier ook een grote heilige ceremoniem deze keer niet speciaal voor toeristen want er zijn 100x meer indiers.

Vervolgens waren we allebei de drukte wel zat en blij om eindelijk de trein naar Risikesh, aan de voet van de Himalaya te nemen.....helaas was deze gecanceled. Na 2 uur gedoe op het treinstation, werden we geadviseerd in een andere trein te stappen, maar die was natuurlijk ook weer vertraagd....maar na een ochtend en halve middag op een druk station dan toch eindelijk illegaal een trein in.

Gelukkig vonden we een plekje en konden we daar ons bedje lekker op maken.

Hier in Risikesh voor het eerst een beetje een relaxed gevoel. Dat werd alleen maar beter na een bezoek aan een waterval en een ayurvedische massage van vanochtend. We kunnen India wel weer aan de komende tijd.

Asia » India » Rajasthan » Udaipur
May 31st 2012

The Udaipur Palace at night
As we arrived in Udaipur, the bus pulled over to the side of the road. Outside our window we could see the slums of Udaipur and the families going about their morning routines. It's always a humbling experience watching the lives of others that are so different from your own. Little children were collecting water for their families and mothers were tending to their husbands and infants. Trash heaps were everywhere and some children were digging through them to find some worthwhile treasures. It never gets easier to see such poverty on our travels and it's really hard to ignore.



As soon as we stepped foot outside the bus we were bombarded by rickshaw drivers ready to take us to our next destination. We chose a particularly friendly one and were on our way. Bouncing around in the back of the rickshaw we peered out of the sides to take in our new surroundings. Before we knew it, the slums ended and we were zigzagging around a very touristy city. There was shop after shop and plenty of restaurants, surprisingly a lot of German bakeries! There were more white people than we had seen in about 2 weeks
taking baths
in this one city. It was strange.



Our hotel was right on the main lake of the town and we had a room overlooking the water. It was a gorgeous view. My bed was in the window nook which provided great views but didn't shield from the heat at all. We soon learned that Udaipur has two daily scheduled power outages a day, 9-10 am and 3-4 pm. At 9 am, it would already be so hot that we'd wake up in our own sweat. In the evening though, the sunset was absolutely gorgeous from our room. We would sit and enjoy the view from our balcony. Large bats would come out for their night time adventures, I've never seen such large bats in my life! They were really fun to watch zoom around.



In Udaipur there is a grand palace. We spent an afternoon exploring the corridors of the palace. It was very beautiful and every corner inspired me for decorating ideas for a future home. Indian architecture is so unique and colorful, I love it. There are complex tile works and hand painted marvels all over the walls, floors, and ceilings. Every
view from balcony
corner has something new to admire. Times like this make me wish I had a place to call home so that I could buy things from these exotic places to use but as I'm still homeless and plan to be for a while, it wouldn't make much sense. Simplicity is always better for a home anyway.



Another day in Udaipur, we spent by taking an Indian cooking class! My friends back home would say that I'm not really the greatest cook in the world, but in the recent years I have made more of an effort to cook from scratch rather than use instant meals. It's hard when I'm on the road all the time and literally every meal I've consumed in the past 8 months has been bought not self-cooked. So to say the least, I'm out of practice but I can't wait to have a kitchen and be able to cook my own food for once. The joy of knowing exactly what is being used to cook my food and the healthiness of my meal is a small joy I'm very gladly looking forward to.



We decided to go with a Lonely
My bed and my view :)
Planet recommended business to take our cooking class with, The Spice Box. It was set up on the second floor of a building. The outside seemed a bit sketchy looking (as does much in India) but the inside was a very nicely set up cooking classroom. There were mirrors all around the ceiling so that anyone in the room could get a good look at the food being cooked on the stove. The instructor was very kind and patient with us. The only thing that I didn't like about the course was that it wasn't very hands on, like the course I took in Vietnam. The instructor showed us the ingredients needed, explained what to do, and then had us stir the pan or pot. The cook in the next room (no door even to separate), would cook the food we would actually eat in the end. So with no real hands on experience, I will go home and try to remake these dishes whenever I get my hands on a stove. Wish me luck!



The dishes we learnt how to make:

As for restaurant food here in Udaipur, we were very disappointed. Jaipur really spoilt us with delicious food and the food in Udaipur just never matched up.. Minus our own cooked
Lauren and I
food from our cooking class, of course. Our only recommendation would be Ambrai, but only for the atmosphere. It was opposite our hotel across the water and had a great view of the palace. We went there for a ""romantic"" dinner for three in the evening.



Our next destination would be New Delhi so that we could head up to north India. We decided to take off our destination of Jodhpur because we just couldn't handle the hot 100+ weather anymore. The north was much more tempting with it's lure of snow capped mountains and much cooler weather. The heat just isn't worth it if there's no ocean to jump into!

April 6th 2012
Published: April 10th 2012


Veiled woman
Our train clatters forwards along the sand strewn iron, further and deeper into the heart and heat of the Great Thar Desert, a scorched, barren wasteland of scrub, slate and sand along India’s North West boarders. The increasing morning heat is already ominous; sand drifts in through the open windows of the train, creating a coarse covering on the leather seats of our carriage, a frustration intensified by the unpleasant mixture of sand and sweat forming in the creases behind my knees. Even the breeze generated by an open window is mitigated by the fact that the only supply of air has been heated beyond comprehension since day break, such that now, a heated rush of air continuously circulated through our cabin, as if some merciless tormentor sought to reinforce the fact that there is simply no escape. I look out through the open window, take an eyeful of our surroundings whilst hoping to not get an eyeful of our surroundings; there is nothing. Infinitely nothing.



It is a twelve hour journey from Jaipur, and in such distances in a land like India, that usually means vast changes await those tentative, disembarking steps from the train. It is
Amy looking out over the Great Thar Desert
one of the draws to this particular state of India, that of Rajasthan, that it contains so much variety and variance from place to place, from the local customs and cuisine to the colour of the city itself (indeed, two destinations on our agenda are fondly referred to as the ‘Pink’ and ‘Blue’ cities respectively). What may have been experienced a few days prior can be left behind all too quickly in many respects, though admittedly, I doubt that the eyes or mind can ever fully adjust to, accept or comprehend much of what is seen in this country, images so unforgivingly seared into our minds eye, refusing to disappear into the subconscious where at least one can subliminally pretend ‘it didn’t really take place.’



‘The Land of Kings,’ as the state of Rajasthan is proudly named, is a land of true magnificence, where unbelievably impressive and well preserved remnants of former glories loom high over bustling alleys awash with the colours of jewels, saris, spices and, as previously mentioned, even the architecture; palatial palaces of former Maharaja kingdoms awe, soaring high into the desert sky. It is the India that many dream of. Amy is one
Ghostly
of them. Although the Great Thar Desert is endlessly bleak, the towns and villages it engulfs are anything but.



Perhaps more so than most towns in this state, Jaisalmer allows this wonderful display of riches and colour to be played out in the most spectacular of settings. Seemingly from nowhere, like a desert oasis, the town rises from the sands of the Great Thar, a vast golden fort at its centre where modern life still takes place and thrives amongst the ancient architecture of this beautiful citadel, whose narrow cobbled alleys and tall, intricately crafted buildings provide cool respite from the searing desert sun. It is amongst these alleys that life calmly goes about its daily business, colourful as ever but at a pace quite different to elsewhere in this country.



To mention colour when speaking of Rajasthan is unavoidable. The people of this state wordlessly convey all manner of information about their life from the colour and makeup of their ensemble, be it sari or turban, often supplemented by great numbers of coloured arm bangles decreasing in size from the shoulder and of course, all manner of gold and silver jewellery (both the
The fort and blue skies
men and the women); a beautiful cipher unknown to foreign eyes but visually astonishing set against the singular gold of the city and the sand. As you can imagine, we spent much of our time in Jaisalmer transfixed with this hypnotic mix of colour, attempting to do it justice with the photographs you see here.



Aside from taking lots of photographs, we spent the vast majority of our time in Jaisalmer finding ways to escape the heat, draining as it was. When we first arrived in India, when some of the locals who bothered to strike up genuine conversation enquired as to our itinerary for our stay, there seemed a unanimous raising of the eyebrows and creasing of the foreheads as we informed our increasingly concerned interrogators that we would be venturing into Rajasthan in April. Apparently, so we were told, Rajasthan can get as hot as 50 degrees Celsius prior to and during the monsoon period, but whilst we do not possess a sadistic urge to place ourselves in such tortuous conditions, we really wanted to see the place!



As such, when exploring the fort and its streets, we happened upon a conveniently
Rajasthani Woman
placed restaurant high on the citadel walls with ranging western views over the Thar, ideal for sunset. Though, any notions of us rushing over here to watch the descending sun would be misplaced and should be dispelled immediately – we literally spent all our time in this relaxing place where we found ample shade and cushioned floors to laze on. Pleasingly, we also happened to find good food and even better company, including one of our old teaching friends from Korea whose path we have crossed numerous times on our travels. Much to Amy’s delight, we also found ourselves sitting and enjoying conversation with the man who began the now famous “World Book Day,” not his only impressive accomplishment (let’s just say we enjoyed his company so much, we’ll be buying our books from Blackwells from now on!).



As people who follow these accounts will be aware, we are not lazy travellers; granted we don’t always make each day count as such but we rarely visit places and do nothing, but in Jaisalmer, this was the story of our stay. One of the obvious things to do for tourists in a desert location is to go out
Walking in the Bazaar
on camel safari over a two or three day period, however we decided against it for a number of reasons. Firstly, the heat during the afternoons was incredible, often holding us prisoner in the aforementioned rooftop restaurant, afraid to venture far from the shade. Secondly, during the day there was a thick haze out on the desert sands followed in the evenings by an almost full moon, meaning that during dark in the desert, we would see little of the famous night skies that help make these excursions so popular. And so, we took the approach that we will one day travel Africa, and since seeing Bedouin Nomads is high on both our ‘bucket lists’ together with visiting northern African states such as Morocco, we decided to leave the desert safari for another adventure.



For now, Amy settled herself under my arm (her favourite place to be I should think!) and with the rooftop to ourselves, we enjoyed another desert sunset...

March 23rd 2012
Published: March 30th 2012


Jagdish Temple with its Shikhara
UDAIPUR, RAJASTAN, INDIA. Friday 23 March, 2012.

Our guide today was called Shurveer and he proudly told us that he was from the Warrior Caste and that in Hindi his name meant ""Brave Loins"" (yes loins not lions!). M was quite impressed with the name. We still had Mr Barun our driver - and will do until Agra.

Our first stop was Jagdish Temple (yes another temple!). This temple is one of Udaipur's most popular shrines. It was built in 1652 and is dedicated to Lord Jagannath (one of the Vishnu manifestations). The outer walls and towering shikhara (sort of columns attached to the outside of the building) are heavily carved with figures and dancing nymphs. The sanctuary contains a black stone image of Jagannath which was covered in flowers. Each corner of the temple also contained a shrine dedicated to Shiva (the Main Man), Ganesh (Elephant Boy), Surya and Durga (not too sure about these as still not 100% on our Hindu Gods). We strolled barefoot around the whole building with Brave Loins describing the various carvings as we went. We took some photographs before returning to collect our shoes and paying the 'minder' who had so carefully
City Palace Museum

guarded them (put them on a shelf for 10 minutes). On our way out we were given a handful of sugar and spices (including basil leaves for luck) by a group of very excited children shouting ""Happy New Year"". M received a large red blob in the middle of her forehead as an extra present. BL told us that it was Hindu New Year and these were a gifts to celebrate.

Next stop was the City Palace Museum, located to the south of Jagdish Temple. The palace stands built in yellow stone on the north-east side of Lake Pichola. It is the largest royal complex in Rajastan and is made up of 11 palaces constructed by successive rulers over 300 years. Brave Loins paid our entrance and camera fee and led us into the main courtyard. Here we could see where the elephant fights were staged. These were not fights as such - more like a 'push of war' (rather than a tug of war) to see which elephant was the strongest. It was a popular spectator sport back then. The women had to watch from behind screens on the upper floors of the palace as they were not
Maharaja Horse Armour
Horse armour with the elephant trunk
allowed to be seen by the general public. The gates to the coutyard had huge spikes protruding from them towards the outside about 2.5 metres (8 feet) from the floor. BL explained that these were to protect the palace from attack by armies with elephant 'cavalary'.

We entered the palace complex and climbed the steps to the first of the palace's miriad of courtyards. We then went up to the Garden Palace, which is the main courtyard of the complex, with marble pool and trees. We saw many paintings depicting varous stories relating to the Maharaja in battle. In the paintings the Maharaja was easily identifiable as his horse had the trunk of an elephant in order for the army to be able to recognise him easily and come to his aid if necessary. In another room we saw the Maharaja's horse armour and many other items of weaponry. Our last stop inside the Palace was the Crystal Gallery which houses outlandishly kitch items including crystal chairs, tables, lamps and even a crystal bed.

We went outside and took some more photos of the facade of the palace which is elaborately decorated with tiles and mosaics. BL took
The Crystal Gallery
us next door to the palace where there is a hotel that is part occupied by the present palace owner. This guy is very interested in sustainable energy and he has enforced a rule that all the boats on Lake Pichola convert to solar power (he can do this as he owns the lake). We took some photographs of the parts we were allowed to enter and made use of the very posh facilities before exiting and walking towards the boat quay.

At the boat quay we boarded a little boat (solar powered of course) and were taken on a one hour long cruise. We stopped for about 20 minutes at an island in the lake called Jagmandir Ghat. This doubles up as a very flash and expensive hotel. The grounds were lovely and beautifully maintained. We strolled around in the sunshine and made our way to the exit quay and boarded the boat back to the Palace Quay where BL and Mr Barun were waiting.

Both of us were still fairly under the weather with our colds so we declined lunch. BL took us to a little workshop where we could see artists painting the Indian Miniatures
Jagmandir Ghat
The Gardens
that Udaipur is famous for. The paintings are done using very tiny brushes with fine bristles made from chipmunk hair (they call them squirrels here). The chipmunks are not harmed in order to get the necessary hairs - just given a short back and sides. We were subjected to the hard sell of goods ranging from paintings to furniture. Some of the paintings were done on camel bone, some on silk, some on paper. When we didn't give in, the salesman tried to persuade us we needed a huge elephant or two for our garden. We managed to avoid any more pressure selling when M bought a few of the chipmunk hair paintbrushes to take home for her art. We then returned to the hotel for a rest. Mr Barun agreed to collect us to take us to the local market at 6.00 pm.

After a sleep and a Kingfisher we were taken to the market by Mr Barun who agreed to collect us after an hour. It was absolute havoc with two wheelers, three wheelers, four-wheelers, hand carts, goats, holy cows, ox-carts, people, market stalls and little shops everywhere. We strolled around and D managed to get a

new frame for his broken spectacles in one of the little shops. All fitted and everything for about £7.00. The technology may have been ancient with a water filled grinder for the lenses and primitive pliars to bend the frames etc - but the end result was a working pair of glasses that D thought were more comfortable than the originals. We went back and waited for Mr Barun at the agreed place. While we waited we witnessed a firework display which we think must have been part of the New Year celebrations. We returned to the hotel, had a good dinner and watched some TV before bed.

Bundi Bus Stand
05.00 Hours Friday 16 March 17, 2012



Up at 05.00 to get ready for the rick driver to pick me up and take me to the state bus stand.

He arrives at 05.30 as booked. 50 rups to the bus stand which is half way to the railway station , which when I came it only cost 25 rups but I suppose all is good as the poor man has got out of bed for 70p at this ungodly hour.

It’s a cool ride to the bus stand and it’s pitch dark

I go over to where everyone is standing and see a man who looks like he might be in charge. I show him my piece of paper with my 2 bus options. I am after the 06.10 nonstop to Jaipur some 170 miles north.

He says “Wrong time wrong time - 05.45, 05.45 - coming coming - Jaipur Jaipur”. Indians say everything twice when they are excited and most of the time when not... He points to were the bus will be. I wait with the others.

The less spotted bald scouser is rare in the bus stand at any hour
Bundi Bus Stand
and I command a crowd, so some photos are called for.



The bus arrives, it has come from Kota some 50 miles down the road and will already have passengers on board and as usual there is a scramble for the door. I have to get a bus this morning or a day will be lost so it’s everyman for himself and I use my ruckie to fend people off and block the doorway. I am on and find a seat.



I settle down as the bus heads out of Bundi and into the early morning twilight. I have some cold pizza and mango juice for breakfast. The pizza I saved from last night, I knew that would come in handy.



Might sound a bit of rough breakfast to you but think I am living like a lottery winner – are you brushing your teeth in mineral water every morning?

The bus driver switches off all the lights and we do the usual swerving to overtake the many lorries on the road.



The bus conductor comes and I say Jaipur, he prints a ticket and I see
Bundi Bus Stand
146 rups. I give him 200 and he shakes his and signals that he has no change. I wave my hand as if to say ok.



He wants the ticket back and writes 54 on the back and signs it. He returns later gives me my change and signs the ticket again .

This state bus is not so bad, we have windows and although my backside leaves the seat on many occasions at 146 rups (1.90) for 170 miles that’s ok. I once got a bus from Raichur in Karnataka to Hospet with my mate Mike and that was a lot worse than this. Still lives with me that ride.



We stop for a break and I get some chai and then on we go. I talk to some lads on the bus and they tell me about Jaipur. We pull into Jaipur at 10.30 and the usual rick driver game begins.



Where to sir, where to sir. I tell them the guesthouse. 120 rups good price they say.

The lads on the bus had told that there is a government stand and set charges for ricks. I
Bundi Bus Stand
say that’s good to the rick driver he pleased. thinks hes on a winner and as we walk to the rick I peel off towards the prepay stand, 70 rups I pay and the same 120 rick driver takes me.



I arrive at the Snehdeep Guesthouse and I am given chai and my room upgraded.



I have an English type mattress as Indian ones are very thin. it feels like I am on air. I have a shower and a few hours sleep.

Alls Good.

Monday
08.00 hours Monday 12 March

After a long day yesterday, today is just chill and rest around Udaipur before I leave very early tomorrow morning.

I go to the travel man who booked my car and sort my train tickets for tomorrow.

The first train will take from Udaipur to Chittorgarh. In the afternoon I will take another train To Bundi.

Chittorgarh is 2.5 hours away and Bundi is 3 hours from Chittorgarh. With a big fort to see in Chittorgarh it will be a long day.

I decide to get some stamps and my rough guide tells me there is a post office not far down the road by the lake. I wander up and down the road but cannot find the place. I bump into Ray Mears who tells me he’s been looking for an hour. I wish him luck, give in and decide to try the main office near the Clock tower. All Indian cities seem to have a clock tower. I take that the British always like to know the time during the Raj so they built the clock as high as they could get it. I found the main post office
Monday
no problem. No CCTV, security glass or alarms here. Just a couple of men and a queue. There’s always a queue. The clerk is armed with a pen and stamp. He beats the pulp out of a saving book. It must be Myra Bindley’s the way he hits it.

The post Office is the only place in India that the price is the same for a westerner as an Indian a stamp is 15 rups to anywhere in the world. It probable costs 1 rup to get it out of India then the world can pay the rest.

Armed with 10 stamps I leave and a little way down the road stop have to coconut, the straw appears from nowhere, let’s nowhere is clean. Coconuts should be ok like bananas and oranges. The rule is simple:

IF YOU CANNOT PEEL IT DON’T EAT IT (Although I have learned that to eat grapes, you put them in a plastic bag pour mineral water in give it a shake and hey presto – sorted.

I go back to Raju and Vidhyas shop for a few things and her mum is on the floor picking something out a plant.
P1020839
There’s no English name for it so I have a taste and tale a photo and move on.

On to the very posh Ambrai Hotel (hope you can see the menu – awesome – expensive here but the same price as the Indian in Gorleston high street.) for a beer overlooking The Lake Palace very nice but expensive, but not to be a wrinkly backpacker for an hour is good.

The Lake Palace costs a fortune for a packet of matches, so only in India do the posh people and everyday life get up close and personal. The photos of the ladies doing the washing are on Hanuman Gnat just 50 yards across the water from the palace.



I am a bit hungry after the beer and stop to take a snack. The 2 round things had a green paste in them. You make a hole in them and put the gravy in. Nice.



That’s about it for the day as an early night calls it’s up at 5 for the train.



PS: I forgot to add that on my travels round the streets the amount of times you
P1020840
get, hello,welcome and where are you from is like all the time.

Sometimes i answer sometimes wave my hand or book.



I answered a man and said England

He Replied: ""Lovely Jubbley"" in that accent



Having a bit of trouble with photos this morning will try later

Pintu and his parents received the pundit's blessings
Today seemed to involve constant rides from the Maharani Bagh to the Hotel Shilpi and back again. The first was a false start as, when I reached the Hotel Shilpi, the 9.30a.m. ceremony had already been postponed until 12.30p.m..

When I returned three hours later, Pintu was having another messy massage.

Today, he wore the same black tunic, gold necklace and glittering brooch as yesterday but a different turban, this time a predominantly-orange one without a tail. The turban man had been more or less on time! A large gold ornament with its traditional swastika symbol and lots of tassels was added to one side when he was seated at the corner shrine alongside his parents; they wore similar ornaments, Ranveer on his pink, orange and yellow turban and Gajendra over the top of her fuchsia-pink sari. The pundit performed a puja ceremony, after which we all moved outside to more drumming and clanging of cymbals.

Packages of cloth and turban lengths were then given to Pintu and to members of his family who had recently married. (I later learned one possible meaning of the term 'an Indian Gift' - i.e. a gift you receive in anticipation of
I couldn't help smiling!
it being returned to you or passed on to another person. The term may have originated among North American (Red) Indians, although it certainly seemed to apply here in Asian India too. It transpired that, while some of these packages of fabric were used, most of them were secured in metal trunks and then given away at the next marriage ceremony!)

Drinks and lunch followed, the ladies seated on the ground in the pretty, shaded garden and the men at tables in the hotel’s dark and dingy dining room. As I’ve mentioned previously the Shilpi was a state-owned hotel but, while its bedrooms were comfortable enough, its public areas seriously lacked investment and could have done with a good scrub and a lick of paint!

Afterwards, I popped into Pintu’s room to tell him I would be returning to the Maharani Bagh for a nap and, to my surprise - and merriment, was greeted by him wearing a bright white face pack. It was, of course, another tradition preparing him for his bride!

That evening, the celebrations started in earnest. Pintu wore yet another outfit, including a terrific off-white shervani (a long coat) with a
The groom's fabulous evening costume
design in gold threads, a large gold anklet on each ankle, the family jewels around his neck, and another specially-tied red, yellow and green turban - this one with a tail and a bit sticking up at the top, suitably adorned with a gold and jewelled chain.

At one stage, a voluminous garland of white, red and yellow flowers was put over his head. It was clearly very heavy and, even after copious thinning out of the masses of blooms, it was eventually abandoned.

Lots of welcome ceremonies and seemingly-endless family photos followed. Pintu took it all in his stride, seldom smiling properly – and then only off-camera - as to show teeth on such a serious occasion would have been considered improper.

Exiting the hotel, we were greeted with the most horrendous sound. Drummers of the traditional sort competed with those from a mobile band wearing a uniform of red tunic, baggy white trousers, red boots and peaked cap, set off with yards of gold braid. Their music, produced by horns, trumpets and other wind instruments played tunelessly in time to rapid drumming, was amplified by giant loudspeakers mounted atop a four-wheeled cart that they pushed
Pintu and Mahi on horseback
Two princes, one horse
right up to the hotel steps.

Out came Pintu, dressed every bit like a Rajput prince, his coat and jewels sparkling in the light of hundreds of coloured lamps covering the outside of the hotel building like a huge concrete Christmas tree. He was helped onto a black and white horse bedecked with ornamental bridle and saddle. The animal must have been deaf because it stood motionless while children nearby covered their ears against the indescribable noise. Pradeep’s five-year-old son Mahi, in a red turban with a silver star on the front, green silk tunic and black jodhpur trousers – another prince, in miniature, climbed up in front.

Down the hotel’s steeply-sloping driveway went the procession - horse riders up front, followed by the guests and the comically-dressed band with their booming cart. Boys, dangerously carrying fluorescent strips wired to the mains, lit their way. Once outside the decorated entrance gate, the procession turned around and made its way back up the slope, resulting in the band’s decibel level dropping noticeably as the musicians put all their efforts into preventing the heavy cart from sliding back downhill.

Pintu dismounted and the crowd started to disperse. Newly-arrived guests
The band...
...that only reduced its volume to push the mobile amplifier and speakers back up the steep slope
were welcomed in the traditional manner, drummers accompanying the application of a red tilak spot between the eyes and placing of a sweetmeat in the mouth, each guest then making a suitable donation.

We all proceeded to a reception area that had been created to Pintu’s specification at one side of the hotel. I’d seen it a few days before, when it was just bare, dry, bumpy earth. The transformation was amazing; a textile carpet now covered the ground, billowing white and blue fabric attached to tall poles formed walls on every side. A separate covered area, like a giant tent, had been created to permit drinks and non-vegetarian food to be served hidden from the view of those observing strict vegetarian and teetotal lifestyles.

Kitchens were concealed behind the drapes in one corner and, being interested in such things, I paid them a visit. There, I found one of the Maharani Bagh's chefs stirring a vast pan of rice and vegetables over a fierce gas flame. He'd already prepared, in another kitchen to one side, similarly-huge pans of mutton in a spicy sauce and chicken in a curry-based sauce - both sampled at his insistence and both

equally delicious.
After a lengthy and enjoyable meal, with copious glasses of water, beer and whisky provided to all who wanted them, Shibu gathered together a group of people and ushered us up to the hotel’s garden. There, to everyone’s surprise was a giant heart-shaped cake, which he’d arranged to commemorate Khuman and Sailesh’s wedding anniversary today. The throng of relatives gleefully vied with one another to feed pieces of the cake to the happy couple. The children looked on in anticipation of trying some of the creamy cake for themselves.

It was a fitting end to a day that, despite alcohol being liberally available, turned out to be a joyous yet reasonably sober affair and I was back at the Maharani Bagh by about 11.00pm. We all needed some rest prior to tomorrow’s long and tedious journey to Jaipur for the marriage itself.

Sleeper Class
08.00 Wednesday 07 March , 2012



Planning, Forward thinking, Horizon scanning all go into the mix when you plan a journey. Unfortunately none of the above is aces in my pack. Jaisalmer to Jodhpur is 220 miles and most of it is through the desert, so what happens when a train speeds through the desert. Yep DUST and not just any old dust SANDY DUST. Sleeper class is not AC, and on the back of that is not a sealed carriage. It has an outer grill and an inner window – none of which are tight. In fact the draught is like a dyson exhaust. We have all been on the beach on holiday somewhere and someone has walked passed half pissed and kicked sand in the air and your sandwiches and you got covered. Well go with the flow and imagine 3 or 4 hours of same. Anyway sleeper class is 2.20 for the journey, so shut up and get on with it. The pictures you see inside the train are sleeper class.



Just to add that in my thinking that sleeper class would be ok for this journey as it was cooling down
Sleeper Class
after 5. I did not take into account that the sits on the platform for 5 hours before departure say no more.



Just when you think that your photo opportunity for a colorful turban have got two turn at once. (Notice the dog under the seat trying to catch forty). A cow walks along the platform and empties the bins.



Off we go, me 4 business men a soldier and a few others. You know it’s dusty when the Indians cover their face. It just gets worst at every station they pile on. In a berth for six we have fourteen and they stand in the walkway. The Chinese looking soldier gets covered in baggage and still smiles. My fellow passengers feed me nuts and get me Chai in a station we are in for an eternity.



I arrive inJodhpurover an hour late at 22.40 and jump a rick an all my dirt to the guesthouse.



We have been waiting for you I am told. Go take a shower and have some food.

Galta Tempelanlage
Nachdem wir endlich mal ausgeschlafen haben (um 9 Uhr erkundigte sich der Rezeptionist per Telefon besorgt ob wir denn wach wären und zum Frühstück kämen, denn wir hatten uns für 09.30 Uhr angemeldet) und im Garten gefrühstückt haben machen wir uns gegen 12 Uhr auf den Weg nach Jaipur.
Unseren ersten Schub Postkarten geben wir im Hotel ab...ob das gut geht oder sich der Junge von dem Portogeld lieber was anderes kauft? Neeein, wir wollen ja nicht so misstrauisch sein...los geht es etwa 140 Kilometer nach Nordwesten, nach Jaipur.
Auf dem Weg halten wir noch bei einem Straßenmarkt und kaufen Wasser und ein olivenähnlich aussehendes Obst, das jedoch wie eine Mini-Birne schmeckt.
Nach etwa 3 Stunden Fahrt kommen wir in Galta an, einer kleinen Schlucht, die 5 km vor Jaipur liegt und in meinem Reiseführer empfohlen wird. Dort ist eine schöne terrasenförmig angelegte alte Tempelanlage zu sehen und es soll eine Menge Tempelaffen geben, die hier Glück versprechen. Oben auf dem Berg gibt es dann noch einen dem Sonnengott geweihten Tempel mit Blick über Jaipur .
Tatsächlich ist die Tempelanlage von besonderer Atmosphäre. Die unten im Tal liegendem zum großen Teil verlassenen Tempel, mit wunderschönen Wandmalereien, kleinen Innenhöfen und schöner Architektur
Galta
ziehen sich in die Schlucht hinein und den Berg hinauf. Überall, wirklich überall sind kleine Affen mit roten Popos, die herumtollen, klettern, spielen, sich lausen und sich von den meist indischen Besuchern mit Erdnüssen füttern lassen. Natürlich kann auch ich nicht wiederstehen und kaufe am Eingang eine kleine Tüte Erdnüsse für 10 Rupien. Allerdings habe ich gerade erst eine handvoll verfüttert als ich nichtsahnend von hinten angesprungen werde und mir ein fetter Affe die ganze Tüte aus der Hand reißt. Stinksauer beobachte ich ihn wie er genüßlich auf einem Geländer sitzt und alle Erdnüsse alleine verputzt.
Drei Stück kann ich retten, die sind bei diesem heimtückischen Diebstahl heruntergefallen und werden von mir nun 3 ausgewählten kleinen Affen übergeben.
Es ist wirklich spannend zu sehen, wie menschlich die Affen sind.in ihrem Verhalten. Zum Beispiel schälen sie die Erdnüsse komplett, sie knacken sie mit den Zähnen und pulen dann die rote Haut um die Nüsse ab. Auch das Sozialverhalten ist wahnsinnig spannend und die Gesichtsausdrücke. Auf einer Wiese toben Babyaffen mit einem Tuch herum und verwickeln sich in dem Stoff, machen ""tauziehen"" und scheinen sich prächtig zu amüsieren. Warum auch nicht, um ihre Verpflegung müssen sie sich nicht sorgen, die Inder bringen
Galta
Bananen und Nüsse in Massen vorbei.

Danach besteigen wir noch den Tempelberg und lassen uns oben im Sonnentempel einen Strich auf die Stirn malen und einen Bindfaden um das Handgelenk binden. Das soll Glück bringen und wir Trottel spenden dafür dann 50 Rupien (90 Cent) weil wir's nicht kleiner haben :-)
Echte Touristen...

Dann fahren wir in die Stadt und gönnen uns für 27 Euro die Nacht ein richtig schönes Hotel am Stadtrand, das hoffentlich mal eine Nacht ohne Oropax verspricht. Es gibt einen Pool - und Wasser im Pool!!- und wir haben ein nagelneues wunderschönes Zimmer.
Alles ist sehr gepflegt und es gibt sogar wirkliches Highspeedinternet und keine Duschzeiten, heißes Wasser den ganzen Tag :-)
Zum Abendessen fahren wir mit Harish nochmal in die Stadt, holen Nicole in ihrem Hotel ab und fahren dann in Richtung Altstadt, also den Bezirk, innerhalb der alten Stadtmauern, in dem wirklich alle Häuser rosa sind, die PINK CITY.
Leider ist es schon dunkel aber man kann etwa erahnen, wie schön es hier ist. Direkt an einem der Stadtore, dem New Gate wurde uns von einem deutschen Pärchen, was wir auf der Tigersafari kennengelernt haben, ein einfaches aber sehr gutes vegetarisches Restaurant
Galta
empfohlen, das ""Ganish"". Tatsächlich speist man mitten auf der Stadtmauer aber dennoch weit entfernt vom Trubel der Straßen ganz hervorragend auch wenn wir nicht genau wissen was wir gegessen haben.
Ich kann nur definitiv sagen, dass es super war und das, obwohl Paprika darin waren. Am Ende zahlen wir zu dritt mit Getränken nur 11 Euro.
Und wir bekommen noch, ein indische SItte, Anissamen und kleine Kandisbrocken, die man nach dem Essen zu einer Art Pampfe im Mund zerkaut. Das ganze soll reinigend und verdauungsfördernd sein und für einen guten Atem sorgen, was ich angesichts der Massen an Knoblauch auf unserem Garlic Naan aber bezweifele.
Dann schlendern wir noch ein bisschen durch den Straßenmarkt und trinken noch etwas auf der Dachterrasse eines Hotels.
An unserem zweiten Tag fahren wir zu einem von Harish empfohlenen ""Quality Taylor Place"" wo sich Christian einen Anzug schneidern lassen will. Für etwa 150 Euro hat er schließlich einen tollen grauen Anzug bestellt, der heute Abend schon fertig sein soll. Natürlich kommen wir aus dem riesigen Laden mit wunderschönen handbedruckten Stoffen, Schals, Tüchern, Tischdecken, Saris, Tuniken, Kissenhüllen, Hemden... nicht heraus ohne nicht auch noch eine Handtasche, eine Tunika, ein maßgeschneidertes und zum Anzug passendes Hemd, einen
Affen in Galta
Lampenschirm und einen Schal zu kaufen und das zum nicht ganz überzeugenden Preis. Zum Kauf verleitet hat dabei aber eindeutig die angenehme Einkaufsatmosphäre mit kompetenter Beratung, die einem zu nichts drängt, einer ruhigen Atmosphäre und professionellem Service (mein erster indischer Kaffee, der garnicht so schlecht war inklusive). Da es hier fixed Preise gibt springt am Ende trotz riesen Einkauf leider kein Discount heraus, sondern nur zwei Schals für jeden als Geschenk. Hm...sicher nicht bei Allem der günstigste Kauf aber die Qualität scheint wirklich gut zu sein. Wir sind gespannt auf den Anzug.
Nach dem Shoppingmarathon verbringen wir noch 2 Stunden im Hotel und relaxen im Schaukelstuhl auf der Terrasse.
Der Nachmittag war für Sightseeing in der Pink City vorgesehen, wobei der bekannte Palast der Winde, der ""Hawa Mahal"" unser erstes Ziel war. Von außen schon sehr beeindruckend, ist dieser 5stöckige, fächerförmig aufgebaute ""Palast"" eigentlich nur eine Fassade und Teil des Stadtpalastes. Die Damen aus dem Harem des Maharadschas konnten hier hinter den kleinen Fenstern des Hawa Mahal sitzen und, selbst von der Straße ungesehen, das bunte Treiben ""Draussen"" beobachten.
Von hinten kann man das den Hawa Mahal besteigen und hat einen wunderschönen Ausblick auf die Pink City, die umgebenden Berge
Affen in Galta
und auf Teile des Stadtpalastes.
Den Eintritt für den Stadtpalast sparen wir uns deshalb, denn dort sind neben der eigentlichen Anlage, die wir ja jetzt von oben schon gesehen haben nur noch einige Gemächer zu sehen, die als Museum dienen. Wie Nicole uns später beim Abendessen erzählen sollte, eine gute Entscheidung, denn sie hat der Palast enttäuscht.
Den Rest des Nachmittages verbringen wir damit durch die Straßen von Jaipurs Altstadt zu ziehen, die wirklich mit all den orange bis rosa gestrichenen Häuserfassaden (rosa gilt als die ""Willkommensfarbe"", weswegen die Fassaden so gestrichen wurden um Prinz Albert von Großbrittanien bei seinem Staatsbesuch in der Stadt im Jahr 1876 zu begrüßen) sowie unzähligen schönen Arkaden und Gebäuden sehr pittoresk ist. Dnnoch ist auch hier alles wie in Delhi stark dem Verfall ausgesetzt.
Jaipur gilt als das Shoppingparadies und ist neben seinen Edelsteinen und der Textilindustrie noch für Silberschmuck berühmt. Tatsächlich gibt es in der Old City unzählige kleine Läden, die zum großen Teil wunderschöne Kleidung, Accessoires, Schmuck und allerhand schönen Krimskrams verkaufen. Ich kann nicht wiederstehen und kaufe ein Armband und einen bunten, mit Pailetten besetzten Sonnenschirm, den ich bestimmt nach Indien nie mehr benutzen werde.
Aber ich muss zu meiner Verteidigung
Wir vor dem Hawa Mahal
sagen, dass ich den Händler überzeugen konnte, nur 150 Rupien (weniger als 3 Euro) dafür zu zahlen!!! EIn bisschen stolz war ich dann schon, teilweise beginnen die Preise bei 750 Rupien. Bei meinem Armband hab ich es dann gleich nochmal probiert und statt 190 Rupien nur 70 bezahlt.
Überhaupt muss ich sagen, dass wir inzwischen ganz gut darin sidn aufdringliche, zum teil nervige Verkäufer abzuwimmeln. In Jaipur ist es wirklich extrem, allerdings empfinde ich es nach einer Woche als nicht mehr so anstrengend alle 2 Meter angequakt zu werden und die Händler sind nicht aggressiv. Meine Taktik nenne ich ""das Höfliche Ignorieren"" und sie funktioniert so, dass ich die Leute immer nett anlächele und einfach wenn sie anfangen zu reden ""no Tank You"" sage. Chris verfolgt eher die Taktik des ""Vollständigen Ignorieren"" aber ich fühle mich mit meiner Taktik etwas wohler.Irgendwann brummt einem trotzdem der Schädel und nach einem wirklich guten aber auch recht teueren Abendessen (Empfehlung aus Nicole's Reiseführer) freuen wir uns sehr auf unser ruhiges verschlafenes Hotel außerhalb des Trubels. Die arme Nicole erzählt uns nämlich dass quasi neben ihrem Hotel, was in der Altstadt liegt, um 03.00 Uhr morgens ein Feuerwerk hochging.
Dass die Inder sehr große
Hawa Mahal- Palast der Winde
Feuerwerksfans sind ist uns auch schon in Delhi aufgefallen wo wir zweimal abends dachten, dass unter unserem Fenster eine Schießerei stattfindet. Aber das die auch um 03.00 Uhr nachts ballern...incredible India.
An unserem dritten Tag in Jaipur fahren wir zum nur 11 km entfernt liegenden ""Amber Fort"", das das größte Fort in ganz Indien sein soll.
Das Fort thront inmitten einer beeindruckenden Felskulisse und wir durch eine 18 km lange, sehr gut erhaltene Wehrmauer geschützt.
Die Hauptattraktion des Amber Fort sind aber eigentlich die Reitelefanten, die die Besucher etwa 10 Minuten lang den Berg hoch zum Eingang des Forts tragen. Natürlich konnte auch ich nicht wiederstehen und wir haben uns nach oben tragen lassen. Schon während des Rittes bereue ich es aber denn die Elefanten tun mir leid. Angeblich gibt es zwar zum Schutz der Elefanten die Vorschrift, dass jedes Tier nur fünf Gänge machen darf und dabei höchstens zwei Passagiere tragen darf aber es ist doch eine ganz schöne Massenabfertigung dort, mit etwa 50-70 Elefanten, die sich hintereinander den Berg hoch schieben. Bei einigen Elefanten konnte man auch kleine blutige Wunden hinter den Ohren sehen, dort, wo sie von ihren Führern, die hinter dem Kopf sitzen, mit Stöcken geschlagen
Hawa Mahal
werden, um sie vorwärts zu treiben. Irgendwie kann ich dann den Ritt doch nicht wirklich genießen.
Das Amber Fort ist nicht unbedingt schön im klassischen Sinn aber wirklich groß und alleine schon dadurch beeindruckend, außerdem kann man wirklich alle Räume, Innenhöfe, Pavillons, Terrassen und Türme begehen und hat immer wieder schöne Ausblicke. Letztendlich verbringen wir dann doch fast 2 Stunden dort und fahren danach noch in das oberhalb gelegene Jaigarh Fort(wenn es eines gibt, wovon sie hier genug haben sind es Forts) von wo aus man wiederum einen tolle Blick auf das Amber Fort hatte.
Dann essen wir noch mit Nicole zu mittag, weil wir uns heute von ihr verabschieden müssen, sie fährt weiter nach Jodhpur während wir nach Pushkar fahren.

Ach und der Anzug wurde übrigens gestern Abend um 23 Uhr (!!) ins Hotel geliefert und sieht fabelhaft aus :-)

Udaipur to Bundi


Hanuman Langur
Chittorgarh
Our room is great we have wonderful views, a comfortable bed and probably the best shower I have had for some time. Breakfast on the roof was simple but cheap, the eggs on toast were suitable enough. At 9.30am we clambered aboard a motor rickshaw and visited an ATM and a chemist so I could get some bandages to bind my injured wrist it was then off to the little village of Badi where an animal rescue centre is located.

We arrived at the Animal Aid United compound around 10am, I had called ahead so they were expecting us and Claire a young American woman met us at the gate. Claire runs the sanctuary set up in 2002 with her parents who hold US and Australian citizenship. Claire began by taking us on a tour of the facility visiting the recovery area first, which was filled with dogs all recovering from one type of surgery or another. The treatment of dogs is particularly appalling in India; the sanctuaries education program is apparently succeeding in building community awareness as many citizens of Udaipur are now calling the hospital when they discover sick and injured animals.

Next we visited the puppy

Udaipur
pen and “Handicapped Heaven” where a few of the permanent crippled dogs will live out their lives in peace. The next yard was full of dogs with mange, they looked in a terrible state but a little bit of medicine and TLC and they will all be fine. Claire then showed us a couple of tortoise that someone had brought in, they had cracked shells so it seems they won’t be going anywhere in a hurry. Next came the bigger animal such as the donkeys, they are treated as bad as the dogs if not worse, Indian donkeys are small but that doesn’t stop greedy and/or ignorant bastards working them to death. The Jacks were quiet aggressive with each other, one three legged male was quite capable of delivering some nasty kicks despite his disability.

We then visited the house where we signed the guest book before giving the sanctuary a $200 donation which will go a long way towards helping many more animals. We met up with our Tuk-Tuk driver out in the street and he convinced us to visit the Monsoon Palace which just wasn’t worth the time and effort wasted to get there. It was now
Sunset over Lake Picholo
Udaipur
time to visit the City Palace so I ordered the driver to go straight there which he did, unfortunately as is the norm in India he also started screaming for more money, even though I gave him significantly more than the agreed price, such greedy and dishonest people these Indians.

The City Palace is on India’s main tourist route so we had to line up to buy a ticket, the American woman in front of us was counting out coins for what seemed like days to pay for her ticket, in the end I told her to hurry up. The palace was a lovely building, filled with glass mosaics, paintings, weapons, armour and even swings hanging from the ceilings. There was also a large model of a Mahayana Singh and his favourite horse which had a fake leather elephant’s trunk attached to its nose, don’t ask me why. We were soon surrounded by a large group of Indian students who can’t help but make a huge amount of racket so we decided to leave, stopping briefly to look at the beautiful Peacock mosaics.

We had a pleasant lunch in a small cafe just outside the palace gates, toasted
City Palace complex
Udaipur
sandwiches and milkshakes before returning to our hotel to change rooms. Our new room is in the older building but is more like a suite, it is huge, and we have a lounge area, a fridge, a bigger better TV and a lovely patio with stunning views of the lake. After a small rest we set out for the footbridge across the lake to visit the silversmith where I purchased a stunning silver inlayed dagger with a tiger head on the pommel, we then visited a small shop that sells miniature paintings. Ruth purchased one of these the day before and it was now framed and ready for collection so we took the opportunity to have our bear picture (purchased in Bannerghatta) wrapped in bubble wrap with the new one.

The last thing we needed to organise was a sunset cruise on the lake which we did on the way back to the hotel, our boat leaves at 5.30pm so we need to be waiting on the dock ten minutes before. The boat was very full all the foreigners pulling on lifejackets and wondering whether they would need them, but in the end there was no need for concern,

Udaipur
the cruise was pleasant and relaxing and the setting sun ensured some great photos. Forty five minutes later we were back on dry land and making our way back to our wonderful apartment, we leave for Bundi at 7am in the morning.

We were on the road a little after seven, which is something of a miracle in India as nobody likes to do anything at that time of the morning, two hours later we arrived at Chittorgarh where we stopped for a quick breakfast, I ordered the toast with butter and jam and got a toasted jam sandwich. The fort at Chittor is the greatest in Rajasthan and it needed to be as Ruth is getting a bit forted out, it is six kilometres long, towers over the surrounding plain and contains some wonderful architecture.

After driving through six gates on the kilometre long trip up from plain our first stop was the ruined Kumbha Palace which is now the home of a large clan of Langur monkeys, we took great pleasure in watching them play and fight as they leaped gracefully from building to building. It was such a wonderful spectacle that we wandered in amongst
Bathing ghat
Udaipur
them taking some great photos until one of the more aggressive males gave Ruth a fright when he charged her and pinched her leg. It was a bit amusing and about time as I have been attacked on three occasions by monkeys on this trip.

We then visited the Sringar Chowri Temple built by the Jains in 1448 and containing some lovely elephant carvings before moving on to the impressive Tower of Victory which was erected around the same time period. The tower is thirty seven meters high and has nine carved stories. I decided that I would climb the 157 stairs inside to the top, it was a tights squeeze at times but some of the carvings inside were worth a look and the views were dramatic.

Rude Indians trying to take Ruth’s photo plague us where ever we go, they don’t ask, they prefer to stalk you, jumping out from behind bushes is a favourite tactic. They are arseholes and I was getting really angry, this particular group were following us everywhere before they piled into a van and drove off, I told Jitu what they had been doing and he took off after them. When
One of the many eagles living around the lake
Udaipur
we arrived at Padmini’s Palace I was making threatening gestures and abusing the bastards so they took off. Jitu then took it on himself to escort us everywhere we went.

There is a legend that Padmini often sat in her pavilion in the middle of the lake on one particular day Ala-ud-din Khilji saw her image in mirror in a tower that over looked the pavilion and decided that he wanted her band that he would destroy Chittorgarh to possess her - why he didn’t just cross the lake and take her I have no idea.

On departing the palace we made a couple of brief stops the first at the nearby Kali Temple to photograph another Langur family and later for a cold drink and to admire some of India’s native Marwari horses. It was then back into the vehicle for the 130km drive to Bundi, the last fifty kilometres of which were on a terrible road. Bundi is another of those towns where dropouts like to go; our hotel is buried amongst the alleyways of the old town and has a great view of the palace up on the mountainside. After settling in we visited a
I am watching you
Udaipur
nearby rooftop restaurant where we drank beer and ate a number of courses as the sun set behind the mountains.

The next day I awoke to a sick wife, we had some breakfast and tasty black tea and then just took it easy till around 11am when we ventured down the cobbled street veering to the left before climbing the hill to the ticket office for the Bundi Palace. As I lined up some rude little bastard tried to push in front of me in the queue so I shoved him out of my way, which I seem to do at least once every day in this country. The palace is a massively imposing building that unfortunately has been allowed to fall into a decrepit and smelly state full of bats, monkeys and goats, but on some walls the remains of some stunning murals still exist and the view over the valley is spectacular.

After about thirty minutes we headed back down towards the town throwing the odd glare at the idiots who were glaring at me before heading deeper into the town in search of a step well which we eventually found after dodging a lot of

Udaipur
traffic but it did not compare to the Baoli we visited near Jaipur. On the way back we stopped for a quick lunch of mashed potato,l poor Ruth is getting sicker by the minute and she ended up crawling back into bed, while she slept I wandered around the streets for a time before going out to get some food.

The next morning we left Bundi for the town of Sawai Madhapur the entry point to wonderful Ranthambhore National Park, unfortunately due to the terrible state of the road we didn’t arrive until after the afternoon safaris had departed for the park, so we checked in and a very sick Ruth went to bed while I went in search of a chemist, before settling in to watch some cricket until dinner time, the food wasn’t too bad and there was plenty of it. On the way back to our room after dinner I booked us on to the dawn safari.

22nd Jan 2012 Udaipur (day two)


I sleep badly and so I sleep late. Rizwan makes me a hearty breakfast of banana porridge and cheese, tomato and onion omelette on the rooftop of the hotel. I look out over Udaipur to see many people on the rooftops; women hanging clothes, children and grownups playing with kites, men sleeping, others cooking. I love the rooftop culture in India, it's where everyday life happens.

Rizwan arranges a sightseeing tour for me today and later I meet my tuktuk driver, Firoz. He is a sweet man and I quickly see that he is sincere. I tell him I don't want to do any shopping and he is the first Indian to joke dryly with me. He says ""But then madam, how will I make my commission if you do not shop?"". He explains that many people in india make their money this way but this is not his business. He runs sightseeing in Udaipur from his tuktuk but also owns a car with which he drives tourist longer distances to Jaiselmer, Jodhpur, Jaipur and anywhere else for the right price. By the end of the day I am ready to recommend him to everyone I see!



On top of the usual tourist things, he also takes me to a local spice, fruit and veg market. I get some great snaps and try raw unprocessed sugar cane for the first time. Something I have discovered is that in India, if you can avoid the main tourist areas you will have a much richer and more pleasant experience. Some of my best days have been when I have wandered freely through local bazaars and not seen another foreigner. The local people are warm, friendly and curious. They speak to you like another human being and are genuinely interested in who you are and where you're from. Many love to have their photo taken and unlike the tourist areas don't immediately ask for money afterwards. This is the India I love.



I'm feeling pretty frazzled with coughing by about 4pm so Firoz takes me home and I get and early night. I had henna painting booked for the following morning.



Udaipur (day three)



A local lady arrived, called Jodi, with her little girl aged two. She speaks little English but we communicate well enough. She rushes through my painting and has done both my hands in just 30 minutes. The pattern is not as detailed as I would have liked but it is beautiful. I meet a girl from China, her actual name is Yangxiou but she introduces herself as Astrid.



We wander down to the city palace together stopping in at a few of the market stalls along the way. We spot a brown leather messenger bag that we both want and later on that day after losing each other find that we arrive back at the shop to buy it at exactly the same time. The man in the shop takes a paler one for Yangxiou and adds oil to darken it. We have our names inscribed in Hindi and pay a very good price.



Having spent most of the day wandering the museum of the city palace I'm bored and tired so I go for an Ayurvedic massage. Its divine and the lady uses an oil I'm familiar with. After relaxing me almost to the point of sleeping she beats me around the head and calls it a head massage. I'm fully awake but rejuvenated when I come to leave and only after her and her husband have fed me masala chai and given me a gift of a small fabric covered book.



I get back to the hotel, pack up the last of my things, pay my bill which for four nights accommodation, three days breakfast, dinner and countless chais in between comes to about £25!



Firoz collects me and my copious amounts of luggage and drops me at the train station where I am stared at once again. It occurs to me that when I get back to the UK and no one stares at me that I will feel anonymous once again. I find it kind of sad.



On the train I share a cabin with an English speaking Indian couple and a foreign couple, he from Germany and her from Russia. Much older than her, I find him acutely irritating as he bad mouths India for being so backwards and under-developed, right in front of a lovely couple who's country it is that he's bashing. I find myself defending the country as best I can but he is so negative. The ridiculous thing is that this is his second time here!! What's worse is that he then proceeds to stare at me and in a much less innocent way than the Indian men do. I put up my sarong curtain and try my best to ignore him. He makes my skin crawl more than the the thousands of cockroaches who seem to have made this particular train their home.



I don't sleep at all as I wake every time I feel something foreign against my skin, freaking out at the thought that a cockroach had found its way into my sleeping bag. Or even worse, the disgusting German guy!! I squeeze off the train, laden with bags and exit the station. I am bombarded by rickshaws and taxi drivers shouting in my face, on the meter, on the meter. 'Rubbish,' I shout back at them. I agree a fixed price of 400Rs to travel the one hour journey to Andheri. It takes us half that time just to get out of the train station. The traffic is almost standstill, the air is stiflingly hot, the slums either side are filled with people who's daily lives trickle on, the smell of rubbish rotting in the heat hits my face and a cover my mouth withy scarf, not that it aids me much.

Jaipur
Our fleeting textile printing demonstration
On our first day in Jaipur we set out with high hopes of checking out a good number of the Pink City's interesting sights, and decided to try the Lonely Planet's walking tour. Unfortunately we didn't get very far with this as we were impeded every few steps by rickshaw drivers who couldn't comprehend the concept of a walking tour and by people shouting ""Indian?"" at Cel every few steps. As you can imagine this was very frustrating! After 30 minutes of it we were getting pretty fed up and started giving fairly blunt answers, mostly ""no thank you"", and then ignoring further questions. To our dismay, however, one of the rickshaw drivers took offence to our new tactic and started an argument with us saying we were racist and didn't like Indians, and that we couldn't treat him like an animal just because he was a rickshaw driver. We were completely taken aback by his comments and ended up in a fully fledged shouting match with him in the street. We were then even more taken aback when he suggested going for a cup of chai to work through our differences. Completely confused by the situation we agreed to this
Jaipur
Jal Mahal the Water Palace. The Royal pleasure palace used for duck shooting parties
and 30 minutes later we were on our way again.

On our second attempt we almost made it to the gate of the old city, but before we could reach it, we were intercepted by a bangle store owner who advised us not to visit the City Palace as the entrance fee was very high and wasn't worth the money. He told us to instead visit the Water Palace which was free to see and much more beautiful. He also advised us not to buy anything in the old city as the prices were hiked up for the tourists. He informed us that there was a widows' cooperative textiles factory near the Water Palace where we could see a textile printing demonstration and if we bought anything there the money would go directly to the widows. He said the only problem was that English speaking rickshaw drivers wouldn't take us to the factory as they wouldn't receive any commission for taking us there. To help us, he asked a rickshaw driver in Hindi to take us there and even arranged for the fare to be on the meter, a first for us in India. We thanked him and he
Jaipur
The City Palace's seven storey high Chandra Mahal
said not to worry but to stop in to his bangle shop to buy something when we came back.

After arriving at the factory to find no women working there, let alone any widows, and seeing the fleeting printing demonstration, we were ushered upstairs to the shop floor. There we were sat down and shown every example of the factory's work, from bedsheets to table clothes and pashminas, all in a very rehearsed fashion. All the while we were there rickshaws were turning up and dropping off pairs of equally gullible tourists to this ""unheard of, fair-trade"" textiles factory!

It was clear that we had been conned and by this time it was nearing the end of the day and we hadn't made it to any of the sights we had intended to see! We did see the Water Palace at sunset which was beautiful, but it didn't make up for the frustrations of the day. We headed home to tell our tale of woe to other travellers and consoled ourselves with some Baskin Robbins ice cream.

The next day we started afresh but abandoned the walking tour instead taking rickshaws between the sights with minimal hassle

and confusion, and had a much more pleasant and successful day. We finally saw the City Palace, as well as Jantar Mantar, Maharaja Jai Singh's observatory with its giant sundial accurate to 3 seconds and the stunning Hawa Mahal ""Palace of Winds"". We then headed to the Monkey Temple for sunset, so called because of the hosts of pink bottomed macaque monkeys you have to manoeuvre around to get to it. A young local boy did offer his services as guide and protector to defend us from the monkeys, telling us that a British girl had been bitten the previous day but conscious of being ripped off/conned again we declined. A decision Cel regretted as we snuck past the vicious looking primates on our way to the temple. Unfortunately the sunset wasn't worth our treacherous journey as the sun quickly faded into the thick fog smothering the city.

From Jaipur we headed to Ranthambore to track tigers in the national park. We set out on our early morning safari with much anticipation but this dissipated after driving around in circles and patiently sitting and waiting for animal distress calls that didn't materialise. Unfortunately, all we saw were some spotted

dear, and some tiger tracks, the actual tigers eluded us. The morning was such a let down, that Cel slept through most of it and missed nothing. This probably won't come as a surprise to those that know her well and are familiar with her tendency to fall asleep in any moving vehicle especially after an early morning start!

Photo finish
Avoid western style breakfasts while in India. Good advice! The thickness of our pancakes promises to see us through the day and repair the sole of my right shoe. We leave Harasar Haveli and make for the Junagarh fort, a little apprehensive after Jaisalmer’s underwhelming palace complex. Once Rob has managed to record over the audio tour with a few directions on how to use the device, we get underway. Apprehension is replaced by respect. Respect for the stylish, well maintained buildings, respect for the excellent exhibits and awe inspiring “frescoes”, respect for the peaceful environment, until the schoolgirls’ outing arrives. The first of many photos with the white “ferenghi” is requested. Jill is hard pressed to get away as one teenager after another pulls her in close admonishing her friend to get a good photo on her Iphone 4.



We leave the fort planning to spend the afternoon visiting Bikaner’s civic buildings and museums. Fortunately we run into a very helpful and interested priest who looks more like a surf dude, at the Jain temple. He insists we drive out to Ladera for an afternoon at the camel fair and shows us the local paper full of
Junagarh fort, Bikaner
photos of the previous day’s event. We broach the change of plan with Govind, anticipating his disapproval of any deviation from his “minimal effort” program. We counter his arguments not to make the 50 km trip, adding insult to injury we then ask him to stop to buy lunch. We purchase sweetmeats and questionable meat patties from a street vendor. A kindly old gentleman out with his granddaughters assists us with the transaction and after a whispered conference the girls request pictures with the two white tourists.



10 kms of dusty desert track, several near misses and we park up in the middle of “nowhere” to join the gay (male handholding seems to be the norm here) throng striding towards another sand dune. “Spending a penny” behind the bush can be tricky in the desert, but there is not a honeybucket in sight so we run the gauntlet at the most promising tussock before being engulfed in the flood of Indian revelers converging upon the camel races. With only a few westerners in evidence it becomes apparent that we are quickly becoming a major attraction. Our progress along the track is punctuated by photo-call, interviews in
A day at the races
broken English, exchange of Facebook addresses and an interview with the master and boys of SESOMU boarding school on an outing at the fair. A long strip of desert between two hills makes the perfect amphitheater for the 500 meter strip across which the heats and final are held. Camels are random racers, some run in a straight line, others charge off at a tangent scattering the crowd to the hoots and cheers of onlookers. We realize there is no safe place to stand, so Jill stands on the finish line obviously believing she will be as safe there as up on the hill. A few shots of the thundering beasts and her husband yanks her from the path of the oncoming charge to safety. Good photos though, perhaps Rob should have heeded her entreaties to leave her be. Jill lives to shoot another day!



We celebrate the day’s champion jockey and wander down to the stalls for a cup of cha. Inquisitive about the women sitting up on the central stage surrounded by a quickly gathering audience, we amble across. Jill is motioned to the stage by one of the numerous organisers for a public version
Camel festival, Ladera
of musical chairs. At first reluctant, her competitive (sporting?) nature gets the better of her and she joins the group. The numerous officials create 15 minutes of chaos with whistles and counter whistles before the game gets underway. Many of the Indian girls have played before, but Jill holds her own until half of them have been eliminated before she is left seatless and retires from the battle to much applause. We have thoroughly enjoyed our day at the races and return to Bikaner and our favorite roadside restaurant, where fore $5 you can eat as much as your body will absorb!

Our Room At Shahi Palace
JAILSALMER IS A FEAST FOR YOUR SENSES. It is a land of camels, jewels, lavish havelis (ancient mansions) and vibrant culture. After another long train ride we tumbled out of the locomotive at the break of day with wrinkled clothes and puffy eyes into the arms of this ‘Golden City’, named so for its glowing sandstone fort. We may as well have stepped onto the set of Arabian Nights. A huge golden fort, like a sand castle built by giants, towered over the historic town. On all sides of it desert life passes idly by: camels sat lazily in the streets drooling on the pavement, women in heavy brass jewelry and neon colored saris walked by and bright woven carpets hung from every window sill.In short, it is the India of my dreams

Travis and I both really loved our time in Jaisalmer. We stayed at an amazing little hotel, the Shahi Palace, which really added to our experience. This place wrapped all of the magic and mystery of Jaisalmer into one tidy, accessible package. The walls were covered in Rajasthani antiques and bright, mirrored embroideries were sprinkled liberally throughout the hotel. Best of all, there was an amazing rooftop

restaurant which served delicious, spicy Indian curries and offered breathtaking views of the fort. We spent several long afternoons here lounging on the bright cushions; reading books, sharing tales with travelers and soaking up the rich culture of Jaisalmer.

We spent one afternoon walking through the fort and exploring several havelis, ornate old mansions, that are scattered throughout Jaisalmer. Inside the walls of the fort an entire city operates - there are shops, restaurants, hotels and hundreds of personal residences. As you can imagine it has become quite a tourist magnet so there is no shortage of things to buy. And buy we did. The shopping in Rajasthan is incredibly unique – it’s where Princess Jasmine would go shopping today if she were real. There are small camel bone boxes, jingling ankle bracelets, antique puppets with long, pointy noses and dark eyeliner, bright pointy toed shoes, mirrored wall hangings, and beautiful paintings depicting scenes from the Indian epic, the Ramayana.

The most memorable experience of our time here was definitely the overnight camel safari that we went on. A jeep picked us up from our hotel around noon and drove us a few kilometers to the small town

of Lodhruva to see the deserted Jain temples there. Lodhruva was the capitol prior to Jaisalmer, however, little of the city is still standing. What is left, however, is truly spectacular. The well preserved temples are carved from the same golden sandstone as the fort. The golden archways and columns are covered in delicate, intricate carvings that really accentuate the artisans’ handiwork.

After visiting the temples we ventured on to a small, local village which was comprised of only a handful of mud and straw huts. As soon as we pulled up in the jeep a swarm of dirty, wild children surrounded us and began touching us and pulling on our clothing. These were not the well behaved, polite children of Nepal; they were more like untamed animals. They yanked at my watch (old, scratched and cheap as it was), my belt, and tugged at my purse almost breaking the cord. Hoping to gain a couple inches of space from them I reached out and tickled one of the smallest boys who had begun to climb up me. This tactic usually sends kids squealing in retreat, but not these kids. Instead they took this as an invite for all

of them to start tickling me simultaneously. I struggled to get away from them but they had me surrounded. While it sounds funny, I was actually a bit scared for my life and practically sprinted back to the jeep to escape them.

From the village we drove farther out into the arid scrubland to where our safari would begin. The jeep pulled over and let us off and we were greeted by our camel driver Maden as well as our camels, Lalou and Kalou. Maden helped us climb aboard the goofy creatures (there was a lot of giggling involved) and then we were off! It was a bumpy ride. We ambled along across the plains for a couple of hours, passing small thatch huts, herds of sheep and cattle, women coming home for the day carrying large bundles on their heads, and even a herd of camels wandering around in the scrubland. Just before sunset we reached a sea of soft, undulating sand dunes. Here we were met by Malou, another camel driver, and a small group of Canadian ladies who had been teaching English in Dharmasala. Our camels wandered off to munch on grass and we commenced taking

silly pictures in the dunes. Meanwhile Maden and Malou were busy making us homemade chapatti, rice, lentils and curry over the fire. After sharing several cups of chai by the fire the Canadian girls returned to the hotel via jeep and the night and the desert was ours and ours alone. We spent the evening getting to know Maden and Malou (who both stayed with us) – learning their stories and sharing ours. Our camp was only 25 km from the Pakistani border. Eventually we pulled out the cards and played an epic game of Rummy 500 (which I won, of course). Afterwards, Maden and Malou made us a bed under the stars, which was actually quite comfortable. The moon was so bright it lit up the entire night sky. As the night went on it got colder so we retired to our bed under the stars. We curled up under the blankets and had a very restful sleep knowing that we were being watched over the moon and stars. We were awoken by the pink and orange hues of the sun rising over the dunes. Maden and Malou went to round up the camels who had spent the

night grazing in the dunes, but they couldn’t find two of them so Malou stayed behind to continue the search. It was quite surreal to see Maden appear over the peak of the dunes at the break of day leading a string of camels behind him. The ride back to the main road was possibly my favorite part. The day was still young and quiet and the sun covered us in a warm glow. We sat in silence for quite awhile absorbing the sun’s rays, until Maden’s phone rang. It was Malou - he had found the two missing camels.

It was hard to pull ourselves away from the sun imbued rooftop of the Shahi Palace but we eventually did. On our last day we returned home from a nice dinner in town just in time to see the moon slip in front of the sun thus creating a full lunar eclipse. Since we don’t have consistent internet access we had no idea that this was going to occur – it was a complete surprise. It was a really special ending to our time in this magical city.
