188, being having awesome weather throughout the year some trees are always laden with beautiful flowers.,1
189, pollution has shielded the natural beauty.,0
190, The memories of these natural beauty remains in the heart and mind for long and gives us enthusiasm to go back to our work of daily life and makes our wait sweet for the next venture.,1

199, he sits in the back (where the view is no worse).,0
200," The towns here are markedly more prosperous than in Karnataka which one must ascribe to the richness of the agriculture as this is not the Kerala of beaches where most tourists we head (we are not tourists,",1
201, with a view to mist covered peaks beyond.,1
202, It is a beautiful and peaceful place to enjoy some downtime.,0
203," you can feel the peace of the surroundings,",0
204," but we do have a great view of a group of four elephants who drink from the water’s edge,",1
205, a beautiful small bird that is elusive and hard to capture on film.,1

210, Working Indians greatly disapprove of beggars and get really cross if you give them money.,0
211, but it is a long way off in a clearing and our view is somewhat obscured by a tree.,0
212, and beautiful meadows.,0
213, Hence either you may plan accordingly or prefer selected items/views after studying the location map.,1
214, However avoid peak ours for lunch as these small restaurants would be crowded too much and you have to wait outside for long time.,0

221, bustling crowd streaming in with their offerings.,0

233, Around 4am we stopped in between on the highway and all of us shared all our experiences about life and one of our friend is singer who sang beautiful songs.,1
234, One can see cloud covered hills and valleys creating a very beautiful view.,1
235, We then went to the top of the falls through the stone steps placed next to the falls to get view of the falls.,1
236," We reached there in 45 minutes to enjoy the beautiful sunset,",0
237, The serene beauty and beautiful sky took our heart away.,1

244, The traffic is unbelievable in this city.,0
245, This is a very special and beautiful Shiva Temple right behind a huge mall.,1
246, But the traffic is so horrible!,0
247, we relaxed with a fresh coconut in the shade before making our way to 2 other temples on the hill.,1
248, These ones were beautiful but small and both of them really packed with people.,0
249, Finally we had enough of the crowd and took a public bus down the hill and back to downtown Mysore.,0
250, dark but clean place.,0
251, After lunch we relaxed a bit at the Kalyani.,0
252," enjoyed the views over Melkote and the surrounding hills,",1
253, Also this temple was beautiful with only few people around.,0
254, We were welcomed very friendly - our room was small but looked clean and ok.,1
255, The rest of the night was quiet and bugfree ;-).,0
256," First we came across the beautiful Jamia Masjid,",1
257, It is a peaceful little garden.,0
258, some guys were cleaning themselves and others were washing dishes.,1

266, You quickly get an amazing view over town.,1
267, We enjoyed the place and tried to sit in a more or less quiet corner - but that was nearly impossible.,0
268," We had amazing views of the statue on the other hill,",1
269, It was so peaceful and quiet!,0
270, We arrived at the bus station in Hassan and were really surprised how clean and well organized this bus station is.,0
271, The bathroom looked about the same (like being cleaned for the last time about 10 years ago).,0
272, to crowded and full of people not caring for others.,0
273," They look for peace of mind,",0
274, which was quite peaceful and nice to visit.,0
275, the other temples were peaceful and quiet.,0

296,"The beach really reminds me of what """"The Beach"""" (the book) would be like.",1

299,"The view from Hanuman's temple is out of the world,",1
300," Truly one of the best views I've had on the trip,",1

313,Well we got togged up and enjoyed a very nice drink in the rather plush Harbour Bar at the lavishly beautiful Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai.,1
314, wonderfully colourful as many of the properties were decorated in fairy lights and so very noisy with fireworks being let off all the time.,1
315, The sheer volume of people was a little overwhelming at times - the population of Mumbai is 18.,1
316," Beautiful scenery,",0

337, The beaches were surrounded by mountains on three sides and had ocean on the fourth.,1
338,Once again we ended up traveling in the dark and missed the beautiful part of the journey.,0
339, The landscape on both sides of the road comprised endless uniform green fields with stony hills and coconut trees as the only aberrations.,1

359,Hello you beautiful people.,0
360, in a clean and safe apartment in Bangalore.,1
361,we thought we were back on track but got scared as l read about mountain bears roaming around and also we saw a LOT of HUGE monkeys (rabies alert) up where we wanted to be.,0
362, probably best we were able to sleep so couldnt hear all the horns and feel the swerving of the bus all night making our minds race!,0
363, our poor tummies were not used to processed rubbish in those pizza's.,1
364,We relaxed the rest of the day in preparation for the following long day to come.,0
365,this was not going to happen so around 8am we headed to the botanical gardens and had a lazy wander looking at the pretty flowers and relaxed sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of Bangalore.,1
366, playing very loud music all night which meant we generally spent the time not very relaxed and feeling like we were being tortured as the music was so loud you couldn't sleep.,0
367, Ride from our hotel to Hampi was wonderful with an amazing view of paddy fields on one side of the road and sugar cane farms on the other side.,1
368," Crowd was less as it was an off-peak season due to summer temperatures,",1
369," Then we headed to Tunga Badra Dam to view the sunset,",1

373,Our last day in India was supposed to be a quiet day with nothing to do.,0
374, Traffic chaos and mayhem beyond description.,0
375, the good news is that the hotel is clean and the room comfortable (though it is a shame that there is an external light pointing straight into our bedroom through the exceedingly thin curtains).,1
376, surrounded by aggressive hawkers and beggars clawing at us.,0
377," beautifully decorated inside but in need of some serious renovation,",1
378," So far it is looking like a good choice – a clean room,",1

958," At sun set it is a very magical place to relax and watch the sun go down,",1
959, The ruins stretch out for many miles and in it’s hey day Hampi must have been a spectacular city and indeed was the capital of the region in ancient times.,1

961," This was particularly impressive from a rather pleasing view point which looked down onto the town,",0
962, instead preferring to get wasted and leave their empty bottles and rubbish all over a beautiful town.,1

987, still being new to India even the traffic jams are exotic and interesting.,1
988, From here the scenery was not very pleasant the roads were lined with garbage; people here do not seem to understand the consequences of their actions or have any kind of social conscience where pollution is concerned.,1
