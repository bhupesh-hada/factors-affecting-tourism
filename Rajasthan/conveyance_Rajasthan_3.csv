0, Reminiscent of Jules Verne’s Journey to the Center of the Earth — where the characters come across a massive underground mass of water — there exists under large parts of these states a vast (if diminishing in recent times) subterranean sea.,0
1, I love the respite on my motorbike journeys from the Himalayas to other parts of Rajasthan.,1
2,I have happened upon other delights in Patan (Gujarat); at Amber Fort in Jaipur; and the Chand Baori on the road between Jaipur and Fatehpur Sikri.,0
3, There was also a section of the road with an avenue of banyan trees forming an arch over the road.,1
4, Unbearable traffic in ever-busy Bangalore Roads was not visible.,0
5, NH4 was a six lane highway and the entire road was beautifully maintained.,1
6," Two young Motor Cycle riders were lying on the road in a pool of blood,",0
7, with their two-wheelers by the road-side in badly damaged condition.,0
8,After taking a brief rest the journey began in NH 13.,0
9," it was a two lane Highway upto Hospet (around 130 Km from Chitradurga) with reasonable traffic (mostly trucks,",1
10," The journey had been slightly painstaking,",0
11, mostly without any road sign.,0
12,on the road side (around 80 Kms from Chitradurga) exclusively trading of sheeps and goats.,1
13, I noticed a goods train moving slowly on the top.,0
14, the state Highway 133 was narrow and not well maintained.,0
15,Initial drive was thru a narrow and badly maintained road (around a Kilometer) inside a village.,1
16, Gradually the road condition was improved to some extent but still filled up with large no of patholes.,1
17, Road condition was not good once again.,0
18, I came back to main road and had small breakfast.,0
19, There was a motorable road for going to the other side of the lake.,0
20,After having bath and checking out from the hotel I started my return journey at around 12 PM.,1
21, During return journey also I decided to depend on Fruits and Snacks only to statisfy my belly with occasional stoppage in between.,1
22,Starting the journey thru NH 367.,0
23, The road was full of Potholes and not at all motorable.,0
24, Gradually the road stretched thru interior cultivation fields on all sides and few interior villages.,1
25,One disadvantage of blindly following the Google Map was that the road condition had not been explicitly depicted or known.,0
26, due to bad roads cars or any other vehicles were not allowed.,0
27, There are no rough roads or stones that you could see while walking but all you can see is a green carpet on all the sides you turn around.,0
28," small roads where there is no tar instead all green,",1
29, most adventurous jeep ride ever with only rocks on the road and wheels rolling over them.,1
30,always believed in this line “It’s the Journey that matters and not the Destination”; this was so true with this journey; Journey to this waterfall called Jagara Falls was just more than incredible.,1
31, peacock’s which are my favorite bird which was all around on the roads; they are all just a feast to the eyes.,1
32, Journey to this waterfall was more incredible than seeing the waterfall itself.,1
33, In the afternoon we left Bijapur by train to Solapur from where we had to change for a night bus.,1
34,and we were really sick of travelling by local transports around this part of India.,0
35,How lucky we were that we got train tickets to go to Hampi before christmas.,1
36, The journey was great and the landscape especially in the beginning around the Dandeli Wildlife Parc really beautiful.,1
37, The train was packed but the journey still pleasant.,0
38, as all train tickets for the next 2 weeks were completely sold out.,0
39,Munnar was around 500 kms or around nine to ten hours journey by car from Bangalore.,1
40,NH 7 is a 6 lane highway and ideal for driving.,1
41," The six lane road was so smooth,",0
42, The road was moving to the horizon like a serpent passing thru the glaring sunny atmosphere.,1
43," road condition would be better in this route,",0
44, We selected Bangalore- Hosur- Salem- Perundurai- Dharapuram - Udumalaipettai- Marayoor- Munnar route for our journey since this route passes thru Chinner Wildlife Sanctuary and had immense natural beauty.,1
45," This state highway in Tamilnadu was a two lane road,",1
46, Three or four persons were lying in the road in a pull of blood.,0
47,Road (NH 209) was narrow and going towards the uphill.,0

49, hoardings of two well known political parties (Congress & CPM) were spread out all along the road-side.,1
50,"At around 9 PM we began our journey to the next destination,",0
51,We commenced our journey thru NH 49.,1
52,This road was narrow with lot of curves and sharp bends.,0
53, There were localities in between and the narrowness of the road made negotiating with the incoming vehicles quite difficult.,0
54,Road was divided in this place.,0
55, One road was moving towards Kottayam and another to Kumarakom.,1
56, We resumed our journey at around 1.,1
57," After driving nearly one hour or so thru narrow roads as directed by my navigator (Munia) in slow speed,",0
58, The journey was between two points of the lake.,0
59," It was as if we were moving thru the country road in a rickshaw,",0
60, The journey started.,0

62," Tomorrow we had to undergo a long journey to Wayanad,",1
63, The drive was scenic with great roads Router: Tumkur- Davangere - Yellapur- Ankola - Gokarna.,1
64,The roads around the temple have the culture of incredible India retained and the architecture of the houses is beautiful.,1
65, The roads lead to the Kotitheertha which is a pond in the centre of the town.,1
66,There's an overnight train that goes straight from Hospet (near Hampi) to Mysore.,0
67, But due to a major oversight on our part we had booked it only part way to Bangalore and had booked a separate train 2 hrs later from Bangalore to Mysore.,0
68,We had barely walked down the street on the main road before a rickshaw driver approached us.,1
69, It seems the trick here is rickshaw driver’s offer extremely low priced journeys but will then earn commission for taking you to 'recommended' places.,0
70, The business of India’s roads and towns had finally taken its toll on us and maybe that short stint in Goa also shown us what else we could be enjoying in India.,0
71, We somehow managed to find a train leaving the following day and booked it straight away.,0
72, toast and a free taxi to the train station - all on the house.,1
73," your eyes began to train themselves and you could see one more,",0
74," He described a scene of the main road (outside this temple) bustling with elephants,",1

79," The road comprises 36 hairpin bends,",0
80," The lower the road took us,",1
81," Was it also for the dangerous road which negotiated extremely steep valley sides,",0
82, an elephant crossed the road merely metres in front of us!,0
83, along the bumpiest road I think I have ever experienced.,0
84,left turn towards Shimoga thru NH 13 (Sholapur Mangalore Highway)and finally take NH 206 (Bangalore – Honnavar Highway) to reach Jog Falls via Sagar.,1
85, which was a four lane Highway and well maintained.,0
86,Road condition of NH 13 was not at all conducive for smooth driving.,0
87, Road materials mixed with rainwater made matters worse.,0
88, Above all the road was broken in some places.,0
89, This road although not very broad but was well maintained.,0
90, We saw a big village market on the road including Fish market also.,1
91,After breakfast at KSTDC restaurant we bagan our journey towards Honnavar thru NH 206 and ultimately to Murudeswar.,1
92, NH 206 which goes to Honnavarwas narrow but road condition was more or less ok.,1
93, A few kilometres later Ghat Section road began.,0
94, The road was zig zag with large no of curves and it neededcareful driving to negotiate.,0
95, Falling trees in various places narrowed down the road passage.,0
96, The two KM long Honnavar road bridge on the way to Murudeswar is one of the longest bridges in India.,1
97, Offered “pranaam” to Lord Shiva and our journey began.,1
98, This road was quite good to drive with wonderful natural beauties on the way.,1
99, It was a pleasant journey with the narrow road gradually increasing in height havingseveral twists and turns.,1
100, The road passed thru absolutely green forests in Western Ghat with occasional view of waterfalls from nearby hills.,1
101, There were some risky turns but overall road condition was good.,0
102,Throughout our journey the “Google Map” followed thru GPS dictated us which route to take as well as the distances to be covered.,1
103,near Bankapur we lost the way and erroneously entered a remote village road with large potholes.,0
104, That was a nightmare and I waspraying that our car would somehow pass that road (around five kms) without any trouble.,0
105, As I explained NH4 is one of the best roads to drive.,0
106,A memorable journey indeed.,1
107, There was also a big meeting (about 200 attendees) I attended where people discussed the issue of building a road through a place called Pony Farm.,1
108," When I got to Bangalore I tried to get a rickshaw driver to take me to the train station so I could get to Mysore the way Madi had advised,",1
109,Wide empty road- can't imagine in the city.,1
110,We started our journey at around 6am in the morning.,0
111," We can see trees on both sides of the roads many times the top of the trees kissing each other making a complete shade over the busy roads,",1
112," We were required to cover 12 hours journey hence,",1
113, local public transport etc.,0
114, might roam around on to the roads but during day time it would have been a rare sight.,0
115," Riding the first 60 km on largely flat good roads (with light slopes at times) seemed doable,",1
116, It was nice and cool - empty roads & ideal riding conditions.,1
117, Riding along NH7 (we did not take the elevated highway) was super-smooth - though some cars & trucks coming on the wrong side was a major irritant.,1
118, and the road was lovely (with gentle up and down slopes).,1
119," On second thoughts - maybe I will put a couple of training wheels next time,",0
120, And then was time for the best part of this journey - the CRAZY ride downhill !,0
121, It is the journey that matters.,0
122," The first part of the journey is slow but scenic,",0
123, This should be quicker but a 30 mile stretch of road is being rebuilt so the driving is both slow and bumpy.,0
124,we reach Mysore and the road improves.,0
125," The roads are properly made up,",1
126, We wind through ever narrower and worse quality roads as we pass one tea estate after another.,0
127," So the first ten to twenty feet from the road is dark grey,",0
128,The first section of this morning’s drive is along the main road that runs through the park.,0
129, After looking both ways (it clearly knows the green cross code) it lumbers across the road and off into the forest.,1
130, Shortly after stopping the ranger shrieks ‘tiger’ and we reverse up to the road in time to watch a large male tiger walk very slowly across the road before vanishing into the undergrowth on the other side.,0
131,"We turn off onto the red dust roads that criss cross the small section of the park open to tourists,",0
132, This is every Westerner's dread on an Indian road journey.,0
133,The temperature is rising and the journey passes hour after hour.,0
134,Eventually we find the turning off the road to Mysore that we need to find.,0
135," However now the journey gets a bit tricky as all road signs are now in Kannada not Tamil or Malayalam,",0
136, Eventually we find ourselves driving through Mudumalai Tiger Reserve followed by Bandipur Tiger Reserve (this on the main highway to Mysore!,1
137," we could see on both sides of the road various vegetable cultivations,",0
138, her daughter and I decided it is a must see and jumped into the train headed north from Bangalore.,1
139,"Since our return train tickets did not get confirmed,",0
140,journey rains started and marriage party was stuck up due to flood in Gomati river flowing near Rajasamand.,1
141, Rajsamand town is on 4 lane national highway so it is less than an hour's drive from Udaipur.,0
142, there is 24 hour transport availability in form of state roadways buses/private travel buses taxis etc.,0
143," One can also go there by train from Udaipur but takes 2-3 hours,",1
144," trucks and farm animals were sharing very narrow roads with speeding buses,",0
145,"30pm on an 11 hour overnight train to the eastern coast of India,",0
146, we clambered into the minibus and headed to the train station.,1
147,"We arrived at the train station at 8pm,",0
148, Families had settled in with home-cooked meals and children were excited about the journey ahead.,1
149,The train left at 8.,0
150, The gentle rocking of the train had me asleep in no time.,1
151,"We were catching an overnight train that evening,",0
152,On the way to the station we dropped in to see the lights of the palace before continuing on to catch the first of our two overnight trains in India.,1
153, We got to the station and joined the masses of people rushing to get night trains to different destinations all over the country.,0
154,The overnight train from Mysore to Chennai was supposed to take 11 hours.,0
155," It was our sixth overnight train in Asia,",1
156, you could be relegated to lying in your bunk very early in the journey rather than sitting comfortably until you’re ready to sleep.,0
157,"Having learnt my lesson from overnight trains in Vietnam,",0
158, this train kept fairly warm all night.,1
159, but I drifted off to sleep as the train picked up speed and started swaying a bit.,1
160," I woke up once during the night when the train stopped to pick up passengers,",0
161,"I was a little concerned about the stories I’d heard about ‘train mice’,",0
162,"Having had many conversations with friends and family about train toilets,",0
163," As per my usual way of coping with train toilets,",0
164,If you want some ‘toilet tips for moving trains' – shoes are always better than thongs (flip flops) for obvious reasons; tight fitting leggings or trousers are better than floppy/baggy ones; and the squat toilets are far cleaner than the western-styled toilets.,0
165,The traffic on this highway was relatively less compared to others.,1
166, Around 4am we stopped in between on the highway and all of us shared all our experiences about life and one of our friend is singer who sang beautiful songs.,1
167, The road condition starts to deteriorate once the deviation is taken at Lingadahalli.,0
168, The road leading to Z point was really steep and had bad patches in between.,0
169," We walked around the MG Road area,",0
170,After lunch we walked around the Vittal Mallya Road area (Grant Road).,1
171, Slowly we made our way back to MG Road and caught a bus back to Whitefield.,0
172, We took a rickshaw back to MG Road - and it took us 1 hour to cover the 6 ks.,0
173, The road is really bad and during these 4 hours we were shaken quite a bit.,0
174," train in Zumba,",0
175, For the first half of our journey we enjoy the luxury of a 4 lane highway where the flyovers through the villages have actually been completed.,1
176, “In India no road rules local people very bad driving”.,0
177, three twenty ton trucks may be just around the corner bearing down on you on your side of the road because they cannot be bothered to go the long way round to get onto the right carriageway.,1
178,"Further along the road we reach the village of Rajgarh,",0
179," It becomes clear that any road will stop well short of the fort,",1
180," And up the road there is a half finished development of modern flats,",1
181, but a 6 hour bus journey was not really what I was looking for.,0
182, The driver was driving like crazy and the road was really curvy.,0
183, The ride on the rickshaw was nearly 1 hour and really bumpy (which woke up my colon and I had to train some specific muscles ;-)).,0
184, luckily I'm making the journey with a friend I've made in Hampi.,1
185," What I didn't realise before starting the journey was that it's only two hours on from this point,",0

192, I started off the journey on 12Th of Nov at around 8 in the night by bus along with a bunch of energetic and enthusiastic chumps.,1
193, We girls got on top of a narrow parapet beside the road to get hypnotised in the bright and mind blogging scene in the panorama.,1
194," Our place was one road back,",0
195, It was completed in 1887 and today is Asia's busiest train station.,1
196, all along the road back to Irupu falls.,1
197,"We journeyed back to Mysore at 3pm,",0
198, The plan was to go for a road trip around Bangalore.,0
199, It would have been great if the journey had been in daytime.,0
200,Hitting the highway next morning was quite a good feeling.,0
201,We headed south-west of Bangalore on Mysore Road which happened to be one of the best highways at that time.,0
202, We could easily touch 100+kmph on that road at least upto Mysore.,1
203, The landscape on both sides of the road comprised endless uniform green fields with stony hills and coconut trees as the only aberrations.,1
204, I and Varun managed to get far ahead of Pawan and Imon and hence decided to take a detour onto a road which looked like going nowhere.,1
205, We ended up on a muddy road which lead us to a lake which was completely inconspicuous from the highway because of the bamboo jungle all around it.,0
206,It was time to get back to the highway after spending few minutes there.,0
207, The road does start sloping upwards but hardly becomes steep.,1
208, Our road took us through famous Coorg coffee plantations too.,1

214," the road system is very confusing,",0
215," I have started teaching the Company as well as the training course,",1
216, Safer if that does not happen though I'm sure as I still struggle walking across the road sometimes.,0
217," We finally hit the road around 2pm and it takes us 2hrs to get out of Bangalore traffic,",0
218, we then journeyed to Halebidu to see another temple crafted in the same way.,1
219,Then on to the road and my what a road this was.,0
220," I'm told the roads are being fixed in India now,",1
221," When we finally got off that road and on to the good highway I felt sad a little,",1
222," the rough road was way more fun,",0
223," my escort leads me straight on to the road where we are walking amongst the taxi traffic,",0
224," It truly has to be seen for one to even grasp how crazy it is on the road (there is 'no traffic' right now either because it's so early,",1
225," honked at as I need to take the road because the foot path is non existent,",0
226, I think this is great not for the students obviously but now I know where to direct my training and what the students need for strength.,1
227, I find out later that it is from the church down the road calling people to pray.,1
228, Nice guy we had a lovely chat and he took me down what I can only describe as the most dangerous road I have ever been down.,0

230, all the locals live up the road In Hospet near the train station.,0
231,"We travelled by train from Goa to Hampi in Air Con (AC) 3 tier which was more than Ok,",1
232, this tier of the train was very busy with people and luggage who have a little bit more money to upgrade to this class.,0
233," One family kept coming down the train with boxes and suitcases and room was running very low,",0
234, then the family came down and there was around 15 of them all having different berths around the train but wanting to sit together which after some doing what they wanted to do and not backing down they won with other people changing seats to accomodate them.,0
235, we made do with the train food of a fried vegetable cutlet in bread and a masala tea.,1
236, The train was so busy with people walking up and down and the tea and food sellers moving up and down the train.,0
237, The train took around 10 hours so we were in by dinner time to Hampi.,0
238, Coming into Hampi felt like being transported to another world and reminded me so much of The Flintstones and Bedrock.,1
239,"we had tried to book train tickets to Bangalore and were on the waiting list - we started at 10 and moved down to 2 during the course of the day we were meant to leave,",0
240," with a couple of hours to go before the train left we were at 1,",0
241, so we crossed our fingers and after a bit of a mad dash through the roads of Hampi fearing for the tuk tuk to roll over after a couple of hair raising bends we made it to the train station.,0
242, We checked with the booking office and we weren't on the train - Plan B was to go in unreserved class.,0
243," The train arrived and after looking through the windows of the un-reserveed class and lack of seating and any space,",0
244,"Plan C - As we left the train station still with no idea what to do,",0
245, I honestly think that 37 hour bus journey in Argentina killed my bum and sitting down for long time skills.,0
246, Ride from our hotel to Hampi was wonderful with an amazing view of paddy fields on one side of the road and sugar cane farms on the other side.,1
247, We had to go down the road where seemingly several hundred thousand of his flag waving supporters were massing.,1
248,"eventually we hit the road to Bijapur,",0
249, The journey seems to be proceeding OK until we he hit the outskirts of the city and discover that the flyover/ring road has been closed as a result of the construction of an overhead metro line.,0
250, not least the blocking of the road to Agra.,0
251, be aware that the roads are pretty awful in places.,0
252, most people jacking out of Karnataka at Hampi and taking the train to Goa.,0
253," four hours bouncing over roads that were not so much pot-holed as cratered,",0
254, The road we were driving on was by far the best we have seen so far--- a two lane divided highway that was reasonably well paved.,0
255,Our final stop was at a cooperative where women (and some men) are trained to make handicrafts to sell.,0
256,Train travel in India can be a hot and tiresome business.,0
257," I met Zane on the Turkey to Iran train (you always meet the best people on trains,",1
258, I really like train travel and its all so comfortable and well organized.,0
259, First we had to try and confirm our onward journey as we were wait listed.,0
260, Better had otherwise it might mean we would have to suffer a 10 hour bus drive and Terry would not like that at all and me too trains are so civilised.,0
261,You can never go hungry or thirsty on a train journey.,1
262, The main section of the town was down the road closer to the river.,0
263," cows on the train station platform,",0
264,"The road down the mountain towards Mysore was rough and rugged but travelled through National reserves so we were entertained with flocks of pretty spotted deer,",0
265, a baby elephant being washed in a stream and a group of very cute black faced monkeys who had decided to come down to the road to watch the humans and play a game of chicken on the road.,0
266," The road became much better once we hit the flats and we motored quickly to Mysore,",1
267,the road and the low vegetation around.,0
268, The train we were after was on the first platform and the carriage not too far away.,0
269, The train started on time and lights-out was at about 2230.,0
270," dusty and narrow roads a lot of the way until we reached Mandawa,",0
271, goats and horses and also cars – thought we could have had at least 10 headons today but they seem to just get off the edge of the road in time.,0
272, bumpy roads and another 8 hours driving – heading more towards Pushkar lots more camels on the road and a lot more trucks.,1
273,a one lane at the crossing – so when the train eventually passes no one can go anywhere!,0
274,"Bella was lying by the main road in our village,",1
275," lying by the road as usual (see the photo),",0
276, what with the temple across the road from our apartment!,0
277," Next to where they were playing cricket on a rough bit of ground was the tuk tuk driver training and exam area,",0
278, the road was one lane each way and not in great condition but they drove the same.,0
279," the car In front of us was overtaking a truck and we overtook both but at the same time the same was going on on the other side of the road so a 2 lane road had 6 cars abreast,",0
280, we set off for Coonoor which is a 4 hour journey mostly vertical.,0
281," The journey wasn't the most comfortable as it was hairpin bend after hairpin bend and lots of overtaking going on,",0

287,I don’t remember much of the bus journey except for the amourous exchanges between the couple in the berth across mine.,0
288," where is the train taking them to next,",0
289," If I were them I would rather write something along those lines 'if you have some time to kill while waiting for your train in Mysore,",0
290, particularly at this time of year as the trains are less reliable due to fog.,0
291, We had cancelled a train and booked the car because we had been keeping an eye on the train we were due to catch and it had been regularly arriving a number of hours late which meant we were likely to arrive at our destination somewhere in the middle of the night.,0
292,This journey starts in Amritapuri and ends in Mysores 27h later.,1
293,The next challenge was to reach Ernakulam Town train station.,0
294,The train was about 30min late so I had plenty of time to find out where my carriage was.,0
295, It was at the very front and trains are long long long.,0
296, A rickshaw took me to the other train station.,0
297, I had to wait on platform 7 for about 1h and after another 2h30 in the train I was in Mysore.,0
298, The journey went smoothly except for the girl who kept wanting to feed me out of date crisp and chocolate.,1
299, My hotel and a well-deserved shower were only a short rickshaw ride away from the train station.,1
300, « Est-ce que ce train va à Ernakulam ?,0

304, J'ai dû attendre 1h sur la plateforme 7 que mon train arrive et 2h30 plus tard j'étais enfin à Mysore.,0
305,I commenced my journey from Bangalore and travelled by an overnight train.,1
306,It covered the journey of about 600 Kms in 11 hrs.,0
307,It definitely helps if one has a personal transport since the temples are situated in different directions and to make it to all these places in a brief span of time can be strenuous and tiresome.,0
308, The road to Mullayanagiri is very narrow with views from steep cliffs.,0

310,HanumanaGundi Falls : This Falls is situated in Kudremukh National Park between Kudremukh Road and Lakya Dam.,1
311, The 100 ft waterfall can be accessed from 400 steps that are climbed down from the main road to reach the site.,1

330, Turns out that the forest roads close overnight as this is when the elephants presumably get their rage on so the bus simply stops for a few hours.,0
331,My first observation of Indian roads was that drivers use their horns more than any other function on their cars/autos/mopeds.,0
332, and the sheer number of vehicles on the roads sends my mind into utter confusion.,0
