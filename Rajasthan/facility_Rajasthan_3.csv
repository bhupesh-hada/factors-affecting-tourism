24,I tried to look for a lodging near the bus stand.,0
25, I approached “Hotel Lalit Mahal” adjacent to the bus-stop and luckily got accommodation.,1

30,Initial drive was thru a narrow and badly maintained road (around a Kilometer) inside a village.,1

105, The room allotted was extremely small.,0
106, Maintenance of the hotel was not up to the mark.,0
107, Even the room key was not operating properly.,1
108, We were disappointed but there was no other choice.,0
109, equipped with all facilities expected in a star hotel.,0
110,We came back to hotel and refreshed ourselves with Coffee and tasteful Banana Fry.,1
111," Large no of shops were visible in that area selling varieties of food items,",1
112,We also crossed the other side of the river and hired bikes to 'monkey' temple with its 600 steps to the top.,1
113,For one of the days we hired a taxi for a visit to Bandipur National Park for a tiger safari.,1
114, We didn't see a tiger but we did wait at a spot for 30 min because apparently there was one about to arrive at the watering hole.,1
115,Reached Kudle Beach resort by 2pm with a couple of breaks.,1
116, It was a lovely resort with an awesome view of the Kudle beach.,1
117,Bang opposite the resort is a beautiful hillock.,1
118,Opposite the Kudle resort is a Shiva cave.,1
119, I'm trying to stay on of this trip.,0
120, we made it and after we claimed our luggage we found my brother-in-law amongst the throng of hired drivers looking for their patrons.,1
121, We took a taxi from the airport to our hotel took about an hour and a half door to door.,0
122," I had that thought about 20 minutes earlier as our cab driver had passed 15 people,",1
123, We love the relaxed rules of India.,1
124, Apparently its the more remote resorts such as retreats in the jungle somewhere away from any other hint of civilisation.,1
125,"After settling into our fancy hotel (there is only one budget hostel outside the city,",1
126,Just around the corner from our hotel was a large cathedral (built in 1931).,0
127, We somehow managed to find a train leaving the following day and booked it straight away.,0
128," Despite reserving 2 nights at our hotel online,",1
129,we stayed and cancelled our 2nd night with no fuss.,0
130, toast and a free taxi to the train station - all on the house.,1
131, Maybe we should stay in hotels more often.,1
132, before we arrived we could not get ourselves excited for Hampi as we enjoyed our few days of relaxation in Goa and had seen enough palaces and temples to last a lifetime by now.,1
133,After crossing the river by the small overcrowded motor boat (30 second ride) we initially settled at Nargilla home stay but after a few hours of no power we decided to move to Sunny Guesthouse that had 24hrs electricity thanks to a backup generator.,1
134, It actually surprised us how much room we had inside one of the circular huts (bathroom included).,0
135, and waiting at the boat dock a group of children made a beeline for P and her camera all asking for their pictures to be taken.,1
136, We did manage to take some adorable pictures though.,1
137, Sadly this did not stop the rickshaw driver from waiting for us.,0
138, Nevertheless this guy thought it would be useful for his rickshaw business to them inform us he would be very angry with us if we proceeded to go with someone else.,1
139, When we entered the temple he stayed at the gate.,1
140, In the tourism office (located in Virupaksha Temple) we found out they were offering bicycle tours around the ruins as the distant between them was not very far (despite what many rickshaw drivers tell people) plus we would be given a guide providing information on the history.,1
141, you’ll never guess who was waiting for us.,0
142,After lots of picture taking and as much sun exposure that we could manage we walked back towards the boat jetty.,1
143,We were informed that this kingdom was very successful at the time.,0
144,Over the 5 hours of the tour we cycled from one site to another (with very little distance between them) and were given some information on their history.,0
145, It was very informative illustrating key features and designs of temples you may have otherwise missed.,1
146,Before finishing this blog we will share a story that stayed with us.,1
147,"What really surprised us when talking to him was that although he has managed to forge a way of life for himself and even his siblings,",1
148, There is a hanging bridge over the water falls which allows workers from other villages to cross and come to work in the mill.,0
149," swankiest hotel I’ve stayed in so far,",0
150, what with its stunning rooms and top-notch view over Ooty.,1
151," I had a unique stay in the hotel,",0
152," my excitement at being in the largest room I think I’ve ever stayed in,",1
153," The lodge is at the end of a 200 metre dirt driveway from the main road,",1
154, making for a very spooky walk to the nearby resort hotel for dinner and back again.,1
155, we only then saw the other buffalo hidden in the bushes to the left getting read to charge us - jumping around in a circle and snorting like crazy.,1
156," There also checked in two other foreign travellers in the room opposite me,",0
157, The fact that I was not so alone in the hotel did make the second night a bit easier to sleep through.,0
158," Taking a taxi from Ooty to a tiny forest outpost called Singara around 30km away took me down from the hills again,",1
159, a monkey tried to get inside the taxi but fortunately I had rolled the window up.,0
160,"The taxi driver dropped me off in the jungle outpost “town”,",0
161," the owner of the lodge I had booked into,",0
162," I had booked myself into the lodge’s stunningly sited Tree House,",1
163,I was also amazingly enough the only guest there for my two-night stay.,1
164, they had five rooms booked up in total for the same evening.,1
165," The owner actually said I could have any of the rooms for the same price (still,",0
166, not cheap – I consider it my “splurge” during this trip!,0
167," including the luxury suite with its two bedrooms,",0
168, or I could stay in one room one night and switch to another the other night.,1
169,"My second day I had to wait a bit to see if it was possible to go on a “nature walk” as well as another evening safari,",1
170," I was disappointed with the rain,",0
171, but certainly didn’t want to find myself having to run away from something only to fall face down into a muddy pool and have the thing catch up with me.,0
172," Another different thing about safaris in India compared with Africa is that the guides are not allowed to carry guns,",1
173," both ready to charge at any minute,",0
174, That was just about enough excitement for one evening for me.,0
175, Unfortunately my viewing of a tiger in the wild will have to wait for another time.,1
176," in the most wonderful and comfortable hotel with an array of fantastic hotel freebies including talc,",0
177," from room service,",0
178, from the comfort of my very own spare bedroom in my beautiful little house in Croydon.,1
179,Our destination was Hotel MayuraGerusoppaJogfalls of Karnataka Tourism.,1
180,Felt hungry and finished breakfast at a roadside hotel immediately after Chitradurga town(10 AM).,1
181,"Hotel Mayura Gerusoppa Jog falls,",0
182, Inside room was cosy and spacious.,1
183, No private hotel was allowed adjacent to that area.,1
184, Hired vehicle and of course private vehicles.,1
185," KSTDC Hotels where we were staying was on Shimoga District,",0
186, while on other side of Karwar district only Government Inspection Bunglow and some private shops were located.,1
187," Had tea and small chat with shop-owner,",0
188,Meanwhile dark clouds covered almost entire place including Hotel area.,1
189, There are no of hotels in the vicinity.,0
190, The entire place including hotels belong to a private RNShetty Group.,0
191, We selected Hotel RNS Residency Hotel for staying.,1
192, Location of the hotel was unique since it was constructed on an area which was extended to the sea.,1
193, Thus almost three sides of the hotels were surrounded by the sea.,1
194, It is one of the best location I have ever seen anywhere particularly for staying on sea-side.,1
195,The hotel tariff was low since it was off-season and very few visitors were occupying the rooms.,1
196, We selected a sea-side room on the fifth floor.,1
197, cleaning of the hotel were not of that standard.,0
198, We were standing at the front-side of the hotel where roaring sea weaves just few feets below relentlessly attempting to break the cement structure with enormous energydue to inclement weather.,1
199, Observing from the hotel balcony that tonnes of water waves dashingbeneath the hotel structure in roaring defiance of destruction was a frightening but worth experiencing.,1
200, Also viewing the sea at night from the hotel balcony was a memorable experience.,1
201, Gradually we came nearer with Resorts and Cottages in between.,1
202, Suddenly we observed that there was not enough “Charge” in our mobile.,1
203, We forgot to charge our mobile last night.,0
204, So the immediate requirement was to conserve the charge remaining in the mobile as much as possible.,0
205," including many volunteers and travellers passing through,",0
206, there were 3 other visitors staying there at the same time I was.,0
207," The rent is cheap (200 rps plus some volunteer work per day) and so I worked a bit now and then on digging a pool,",1
208, The first time I met some people volunteering at Buddha Garden who invited me to join them the following Monday.,1
209, There was also a big meeting (about 200 attendees) I attended where people discussed the issue of building a road through a place called Pony Farm.,1
210,"The next day I met up with some Buddha Garden people at one of the lodging areas,",1
211, Sadhana Forest is an all-vegan reforestation/restoration project with over 1000 volunteers per year.,1
212, Haiti and another location in India) and then we watched the first part of a documentary on all kinds of issues mankind is experiencing nowadays.,1
213,The last day I hung out with Madi before the taxi showed up at the Youth Centre to take me away to the Pondicherry bus station.,1
214, 150 rupees to get to Mysore is not a whole lot of money so I took the taxi (which fit 10 people) and got to Mysore about 3 hours later.,1
215, I thought of doing some sight-seeing in Mysore but touristing with my house on my back and lack of sleep didn’t seem like a fun idea so instead I went to a hotel where they had wifi and I could charge my laptop and phone.,1
216, The land had gotten very green and beautiful though and it was clear I was in for the next stage of my stay in India.,1
217, The memories of these natural beauty remains in the heart and mind for long and gives us enthusiasm to go back to our work of daily life and makes our wait sweet for the next venture.,1
218," TV and internet cables,",1
219," local shops ambience,",0
220, All of a sudden we saw a small hotel beside a shop.,1
221, but unfortunately we were not allowed to take pictures inside.,1
222," A 'kinda-obvious-on-hindsight' tip to anyone trying this for the first time: Getting enough calories is necessary for a trip like this,",1
223," Sadly - 2-wheelers are not allowed on top of Nandi hills,",0
224," The hotel staff suggest it will take 7-8 hours,",1
225, We manage this despite a delay caused by the fact that the mobile phone signal is too weak to allow us to pay our bill by credit card and we have to scrabble around to see if we have enough to pay by cash instead.,1
226, the hotel has not succeeded in finding us a guide.,0
227," We encounter Mr H as we set out before breakfast to find an ATM to replenish our cash,",0
228, and suggest to him that we hire an auto rickshaw driver to show us the way.,1
229, the grateful Wodeyars were reinstated as the ruling Maharajas by the British.,1
230," The rooms are mostly devoid of furniture and the whole place could do with some maintenance and TLC,",1
231," I stayed at Malvikaa's daughter's place for 2 days and then we drove south through Mysore and Gundlupet to the Bandipur National Forest & Wildlife Reserve,",1
232," but unfortunately that's not possible right now due to an unstable internet connection,",1
233, I feel very comfortable here and have been considering the reasons.,0
234,"We return to the lodge where the occupants of one very full jeep,",1
235,"leave the lodge and set off for the hills in Wayanad,",0
236," Our hotel is perched on a hillside overlooking rolling slopes of tea in all directions,",1
237," The hotel is newly built and we have a spacious room with floor to ceiling glass on two walls,",1
238," But despite a lot of sitting and waiting patiently,",1
239, There’s a lot of sitting waiting involved in game drives and it’s always hard to know how long to wait and when to move on.,1
240,We return to the lodge for breakfast and start the mega-task of downloading and editing the photos before heading out again at 3.,0
241," We manage to get photos of a brilliant blue Indian kingfisher,",1
242, and survey the groups of huddled people waiting on the corners for the gangmasters to arrive looking for day rate workers.,1
243," She manages to render three roadside toilets (one in a petrol station and two in a hotel,",1
244," A legless beggar sees us waiting in the car and drags himself over on his knuckles to scratch pathetically at the car door,",0
245,"After six hours we roll into our lodge in Kabini,",0
246, But it is the place you need to stay to be sure of getting on safari.,0
247, The number of visitors per day is limited so you don’t want to find you are staying in a nice lodge but cannot get into the park!,1
248,As the trip was shortly planned we were unable to book accommodation in the few hotels available at Hampi or near by town Hospet.,1
249,where we could book Hotel Sarvesh thru makemytrip.,1
250,Carry with you adequate drinking water as no shops are available in most of the parts.,0
251, However avoid peak ours for lunch as these small restaurants would be crowded too much and you have to wait outside for long time.,0
252,The city was once magnificent and prosperous ruled by the Deva Raya kings.,1
253, The market place with miles forgotten shops which sold gold-silver jewellery in return of horses must have been splendid.,0
254,"They developed many facilities like roads,",1
255, One can stay in Udaipur and then hire transport from there.,1
256, there is 24 hour transport availability in form of state roadways buses/private travel buses taxis etc.,1
257, Many hotels are available on way to lake side where one can stay.,1
258, the hotel’s restaurant.,0
259, and I was amazed at the skill of the painters who’d managed to paint a cow in one of the frescos whose eyes and face literally followed you as you walked past it.,1
260, On our way back to the hotel we briefly stopped in at St Philomena’s Church and the Eco-Friendly Incense Sticks Factory.,0
261, where we kicked back in the rooftop bar before heading down to the hotel lobby at midnight to access the free wifi.,1
262, so we settled in the hotel lobby with the free wifi and caught up on our travel notes.,1
263," Leaving our shoes in the open air ‘cloak room’ across the street,",1
264, we had just enough time to enter the temple before it closed.,1
265,We arrived in Mysore and checked into our hotel – KVC International Hotel.,1
266," the hotel had huge clean rooms with hot water that worked,",0
267, the wifi only worked in the lobby.,0
268," The biggest let down at this hotel was that the hotel staff were inefficient,",0
269,"We decided to have a quick lunch in the hotel restaurant,",1
270, How could a business as large as this hotel operate so inefficiently?,1
271, because apparently the well fed Maharaja wasn’t already heavy enough on the poor elephant’s back.,1
272, where the eyes of some of the humans and the heads of the animals followed you from one side of the room to the other – our guide liked calling them ‘the Indian Mona Lisas’.,0
273, It was impressive enough that a few of us kept walking backwards and forwards to test the theory.,1
274,On our way back to the hotel we dropped into St Philomena’s Church.,0
275,The usual suspects gathered for pre-dinner drinks at our hotel’s bar before our minibus drove us to Park Lane Restaurant for dinner.,1
276, had one last drink in the hotel bar before calling it a night.,1
277, Andrew and I went for a walk around the hotel to find an ATM.,0
278," As was the case in all the smaller shops and cafes we went to,",0
279, and we entered the rectangular complex through a room with tall pillars.,1
280, the three shrines and their associated rooms were all as decorative as the outside walls.,0
281, so our group was using two day rooms until we left.,0
282, you could be relegated to lying in your bunk very early in the journey rather than sitting comfortably until you’re ready to sleep.,0
283, I packed a few layers of clothing and a warm jacket for when the aircon was cranked to ‘arctic’.,0
284, but Andrew reliably informed me that they were a bit ‘messy’ as the trip wore on.,1
285, We had already booked a home stay “Kanthi niwas” for us.,0
286, There was very less water however we even enjoyed there and then returned back to our home stay to have our lunch and then we got ready to head towards Kemmanagundi hills.,1
287, We then went back to our home-stay which took around 40 minutes to reach.,0
288,Where should we stay in Bangalore?,0
289, But we were so lucky to have stayed in Villa Camelot - the advantages outweighed the disadvantages.,1
290," all perfectly clean and our room was just amazing: huge,",0
291,a room with a bathroom.,0
292, By stepping outside the room we were standing in the family living room and the kitchen.,1
293, we really enjoyed some extensive shopping experience.,1
294," a really beautiful part of Bangalore: new shopping malls for the middle class,",1
295," It is ruled by business,",0
296, For lunch we managed to get a table in the famous and delicious Queen's Restaurant in Church Street.,1
297," visited some of the little shops til we finally reached Krishnarajendra Market,",1
298, a fantastic shopping street with small shops galore!,0
299, about a lot old society rules and a lot of society pressure.,0
300, to visit our new friends again who made our stay great (despite the traffic)!,1
301," staying in the middle of town would have saved us a lot of hours on the bus,",1
302, Without an express ticket we would have had to wait for 3 hours in a squeezed queue.,1
303, Finally we had enough of the crowd and took a public bus down the hill and back to downtown Mysore.,0
304, A visit to the Philomena's Cathedral and a walk over the Devaraja Market was enough tourist activity for us.,1
305, The Thali is really good and cheap - but it is extremely spicy!,0
306, We had an Ok place to stay last time in Mysore but this time we wanted to be a bit closer to town.,1
307, We were welcomed very friendly - our room was small but looked clean and ok.,1
308, When we entered into our room and switched on the lights we saw some small bugs running around in the bed.,1
309,"next room we carefully checked the matrasse and the sheets,",0
310, We had to wait in a queue for 20 minutes but without much hassle and much pushing.,0
311, food was decent and later we could sit along the river and enjoy the sound of frogs.,1
312, Just some big hotels were having crazy parties where one could spent a lot of money.,1
313, we did not feel like staying overnight in another pilgrimage town.,1
314, But somehow we managed to find a local bus to Shravanabelagola.,0
315, The whole trip set us back about 1 US$ per person one way - that looked like another really cheap day!,1
316, This hotel is the only decent sleeping option here.,0
317, this time we were glad we had chosen to stay in Hassan!,1
318,What a cheap an fulfilled day it was!,1
319, In the evening we had another fantastaic dinner at the Mayura International Hotel in Hassan.,0
320, as there were 150 stairs waiting for us.,1
321, Somehow we managed with 4-5 breaks in between.,0

1185,I am very tired today; staying up so late blogging is not good for me!,0
1186,Eventually there will be a day when nothing really out of the ordinary happens and I'll have to resort to summarizing little things that I've noticed here and there but haven't really been able to fit into any other post.,1
1187, Sumedha and myself were able to go shopping for saris.,1
1188,"We wandered into a jewlelry shop first,",1
1189," I was surprised that we could just take the earrings off the wall of the shop and try them on and put them back,",1
1190, so we wandered down the street until we found a shop that looked promising.,1
1191,"The shop was full of women,",0
1192, I was carrying enough to money to buy a sari (about 5000 Rs) and the last thing I wanted was to lose that.,0
1193, Especially since I had borrowed 2000 of them from Sam since I didn't have enough cash on me.,1
1194," In that first shop we went to they catered more to the everyday people,",1
1195," We wandered to the back of the shop to look at kurtis,",1
1196,Once we finally got out of that shop (we all kept looking at kurtis) we wandered down the street again until we saw another sari shop.,1
1197," The shop owner told us we could only try on a sari if we were likely to buy it,",0
1198, I can't wait to wear mine for reals.,1
1199," At the time I figured it'd be easier to just buy a blouse ready-made,",0
1200,"The next shop we wandered into because they sold petticoats,",1
1201,Our next shop ended up being out last sari shop.,0
1202," The overall feeling of the shop was more high-end than that of the second,",1
1203," I was interested to see that in this shop the lady helping Fae with her saris offered her opinion on the choice of fabric color,",1
1204," The shop had a tailor who worked nearby come over to arranged making the blouses out of the extra sari fabric,",1
1205, the tailor led us to his shop about two blocks away that was tucked into a sketchy back alley that made us a bit nervous when he first led us down.,1
1206," The shop was about 10"""" deep and 6"""" wide,",0
1207, when the bill came he had added extra charges and the two Indian girls had to heckle (again) to get him to drop the price a bit.,1
1208," We quickly stopped in a last shop to buy leggings for me,",0
1209, as long as we'd go to a shop afterwards for only 5 minutes.,1
1210, Apparently the shop had a deal with the auto driver that if he got people to go to the shop for 5 minutes they'd give him a coupon for 100 Rs and a t-shirt.,1
1211, Especially when he'll wait while we eat then drive us back to the hotel after we visit the shop.,1
1212, super-cheap restaurant in the Kamat Hotel (I think.,0
1213, you're allowed to mix your curry and rice together with your fingers and scoop it into your mouth with your hands.,1
1214," since I was shopped out and also hadn't figured out what souveniers I wanted to get for what people,",0
1215, Something really funny happened in the shop: I kept looking at a variety of trinkets as possible souveniers for people but with no intention to buy.,0
1216, When we were in the jewellry room he showed me a box of bracelets and said 300-400 Rs.,1
1217," Just after we had left the curio shop I thought our auto driver was acting strangely,",0
1218," driving slowly and waiting for the other auto with Sumedha,",1
1219, Turns out these guys just worked for a silk seller and their method of getting business was for shopping foreigners (and perhaps Indians as well) to make an unscheduled stop.,0
1220, our auto drivers took us back to our hotel like good little boys.,0
1221,"We tried on our clothes in Naveet and Sumedha's room; turns out one of the kurtis I bought was too small and one of Fae's was too big,",1
1222, but I didn't inflate the tire nearly enough and had a huge problem just riding straight.,1
1223, Rangolis can also be found in the pooja room (the room where the gods reside) in the house.,1
1224, Pradash showed us several gadgets that are available to help women make their Rangoli faster since they may have more responsibilities now that just staying at home.,1
1225, it means I get to just stay in my room and veg out tonight.,1
1226, What's even better is that as I was writing this post I had a couple times where the electricity in my room went out.,1
1227," along with brown outs and grey outs--since my internet bugged out at that time,",0
1228," a few were comfortable enough to spill the beans: for sure,",0
1229, I went to a shop a few blocks away for photos I would need for FRRO registration (see: Papers Please).,1
1230," I tried to pay him to wait for me outside the shop,",0
1231," who was charging just as ridiculous a rate (30 rps ); if they were going to steal from me,",1
1232, This poses a bit of a logistical issue for someone not familiar with the city.,0
1233, the motherfucker dropped me off about three blocks away from my hotel and did it with attitude.,1
1234," because my body still hasn't quite adjusted and decided that it had had enough sleep,",0
1235, People who have been here for a couple days inform me that every morning around that time the prayer comes on and the dogs howl with the singing.,1
1236, but the rules make a lot of sense to me.,0
1237, then a bus back to the hotel where we scrounge our own dinner.,0
1238, but it seems the drivers are honest enough to tell you if they don't know where it is or if they can't even get you close.,1
1239, We had some drivers to chauffeur us from the airport to our hotel in Ganga Nagar.,1
1240, Anyone who has traveled to India knows: the traffic there operates on completely different rules than it does in the states.,1
1241," and stay on the left side of the road,",0
1242, but beyond that there are few rules to follow.,0
1243, though it is not very luxurious by American standards.,0
1244, I lucked out and got a room to myself on the second floor with some nice natural lighting and a comfy bed.,1
1245, you have to stick your room key in a slot by the door.,0
1246, So now I know: some hotels have key-slots to activate the room's electricity.,1
1247," My largest snafu today came when my room phone rang (which is,",1
1248, and then I did hang up and went outside my room to talk to them since they were right there.,0
1249, I did turn back to the room and tried not to attract their attention anymore but the damage was done.,1
1250, The left hand stayed strictly in my lap and did not come anywhere near my food.,1
1251, and then I headed off to my room to write these first two entries.,0
1252, I figured I better stay up and do this now--if I keep having so many new experiences every day I can't afford to fall behind on writing them down!,1
1253, an hourly hotel within the airport.,0
1254," we managed to get through immigration without a fuss,",0
1255, it seems that one does not queue up in India.,0
1256," Patrick and I (Yao did not check any bags so he had already gone to the hotel) decided we wouldn't bother to go to the hotel,",1
1257," Things are cheap here: the sandwich and water cost less than 200 Rs (rupees) which is around $3,",0
1258," and the guy at the coffee shop even heated them up in the microave,",0
1259, it was simply a matter of waiting before we boarded our last flight to Bangalore.,0
1260, The drive was very comfortable in the highway.,0
1261,We did not have a hotel reservation in Mysore.,1
1262, Most of the weekend trip we made were without a hotel reservation.,0
1263, Sometimes we landed in to trouble but most of the times we were able to find good hotels at relatively low rates when we walk in and ask for room rates.,1
1264, I stopped in front of a 3-Star hotel but they did not have any room available.,1
1265, Then he explained that he can help us get a hotel room at low rates in the available vacant rooms.,1
1266," he took us to a hotel called """"Adhi Manor"""" where he arranged an A/c room for us at a rent about 40%!",0
1267,Hotel Adhi Manor: The hotel was pathetic.,0
1268, they moved us to another room but that was no different.,0
1269, the first thing I did was to find another hotel for the rest of our stay in Mysore.,0
1270,"Hotel Palace Plaza: After visiting couple of hotels,",0
1271," I found Hotel Palace Plaza,",0
1272, which turned out to be an excellent place for stay in Mysore.,1
1273, Rent was bit high compared to the low rates we got in the previous hotel but the stay was very comfortable.,1
1274, we exited the zoo and drove back to the hotel for a short break.,1
1275, we returned the Dynasty restaurant in Hotel Mysore Palace for lunch and ordered some Chinese food.,1
1276, they offered us to take to a great market place in Mysore were we can shop as long as we want and he will wait outside for us.,1
1277," We had heard about the theme restaurant at Hotel Pai Vista,",1
1278, Photography is not allowed inside the palace but you can take pictures outside the buildings.,0
1279, You can rent automated voice guide system which will give detailed history of each important buildings and rooms in the palace.,1
1280,Mysore is a great place for shopping silk items and Sandal products.,1
1281," Taxi driver,",0
1282, but disappointed to see a small shop which wasn't worth the drive at all.,1
1283, the guide had said the factory is open only on Tuesdays for visitors but we learnt from the shop that it is open for all any day.,0
1284, They all came to me on my cab ride from the airport to my apartment.,0
1285, security in Doha was efficient (you get to keep your shoes on your feet!,1
1286," leaving the hotel by foot is not recommended,",1
1287," and there isn't much around the hotel other than furniture stores and crumbling bodegas (I'm sure they have a name for them here,",1
1288," I started searching for some kind of """"managed farmland"""" where someone else will take care of all the work and we just need to spend our time with plants and pets.",1
1289,• Divine Euphoria is a resort-cum-farm land.,1
1290," There are lot of common facilities like library,",1
1291, even though it has all facilities of a resort.,0
1292, They have a restaurant and most modern amenities you see in luxury villages.,1
1293, we decided to go by a taxi instead of driving myself.,0
1294," Whether you want to buy your own plot and build a farm house or buy an already built cottage or just rent a cottage for overnight stay or just have some day trip picnic,",1
1295,• No internet connection.,0
1296, Day picnics and night stays are offered only for the potential customers and people who have contacts with them.,1
1297, which visitors can rent for overnight stay at the farmland.,1
1298, as it is so large bicycling makes it much easier to go further into the park.,0
1299,"Usually my ego is strong enough to weather passing insults,",1
1300," Once they waited for me to catch up,",0
1301, I didn't see them until we were back at the beginning of the park; they were still chatting and waiting for our driver to take us back to our hotel when I finally arrived.,0
1302, and I was still small enough that my father would sometimes pick me up when he came home from work.,1
1303," The registration charges were Rs 450/- per person for all three days,",0
1304, We saw a queue for the breakfast and got into the queue.,0
1305,We had to make queues for breakfast and bathrooms.,0
1306, we had to stand on long queues for food.,0
1307, as it was a good compulsory exercise to digest the food and stay active.,1
1308,The lunch queue was longer than the previous days (probably there were more participants on the last day).,0
1309, but there were endless queues near each food counter.,0
1310," Some wise foodies like me were taking the food plate and standing immediately in the queue near repeat counter,",0
1311, the bus to Mekedatu was waiting indefinitely to be filled up with passengers.,0
1312, It seemed to me a small town with very basic facilities available.,0
1313, This part of Karnataka is enriched with coffee and pepper plantation and most of the homestays or resorts are either ‘an old estate’ or a part of it converted to a homely accommodation for tourists.,0
1314,"the hotel guy,",0
1315, I saw one ‘very’ colorful bus just entered the stand and it seemed a lot of people were waiting to get un board from it.,1
1316," The bus didn’t wait too long and surprisingly with ‘not much’ people,",0
1317,‘Only one lodge here to the right.,0
1318,"‘Rooms to stay tonight’,",0
1319,I walked back to the same shop and asked for ‘reason’.,0
1320, I ran to him and asked for his advice to find me a place to stay tonight.,1
1321, I managed to get hold of ‘The Chilligeri Estate’.,1
1322, any place to stay in your estate?,0
1323, No vehicles are allowed rather there are no roads to reach the base of the falls.,0
1324," So to bring them to the comfort level,",1
1325, if I could stay here all alone in this estate till 9pm.,0
1326, Then I realized the ‘burning stay of hunger’ in my stomach.,1
1327,When last I wrote we were waiting to get picked up by Sagar to head up north to his new wife's hometown to have another reception there.,1
1328," but shortly afterwards Deepa informed him that her mother was making a bunch of food for us in Havari,",1
1329, Some people have stomachs which seem to be able to expand to accomodate whatever is necessary - I am not htat way.,0
1330, Once we finished the bus took us to the small nearby hotel we would be staying the night in.,1
1331," The rest stayed behind because Deepa's family is quite orthodox and normally the men eat first and then the women,",0
1332, I wasn't sure what kind of accomodation they would have for us.,1
1333, but luckily I'm always prepared =) The best part of where we were staying was the rooftop courtyard.,1
1334," but there were a whole number of guys who seemed to work for the hotel that slept out there,",1
1335, but after sitting amongst everyone in their faciest saris we eventually became self-conscious and went upstairs to change into nicer clothes (the reception was in the hotel where we were staying).,1
1336," After we sat down there was a loooong wait before anything happened,",1
1337, (Sagar told us later that the hotel guys were super happy that we enjoyed the meal).,1
1338," Deepa was staying in Havari for a few more weeks because she has to write her final engineering exams,",1
1339, so he took us to a resort just outside the city limits.,0
1340, and we managed to squeeze 6 of us in to his tiny compact surprisingly comfortably.,1
1341," He took us to his family home where we transfered into a much larger car which could accomodate all of us,",0
1342,The resort was gorgeous.,0
1343," gated community with a mix of privately owned vacation condos and hotel suites,",1
1344," with resort amenities like a fitness club,",1
1345, We were especially taken by the pool because it has been so hot here and our hotel in Bangalore doesn't have one.,1
1346, it was pool time!,0
1347," While Sagar napped (well deservedly) on the pool deck,",1
1348," Vanessa really needed to get a SIM card for her cell phone because she is staying here for a while after we leave,",1
1349, The car dropped me and Vanessa off at the hotel (she would be sleeping in my room that night) and the boys picked up their luggage.,1
1350,"When I got up to my room with Vanessa,",0
1351, time sensitive Scout documents to review and a number of issues for school to deal with.,1
1352," We had planned to hire a car to go to Bandipur National Park to do a wildlife safari this day after failing to make it happen on Friday,",0
1353, but that was enough) with some little hooligans over by a GIANT tree that we wanted to take a picture in.,1
1354," We waited around 20 minutes but there was no sign of it letting up,",1
1355, where she will be staying for the rest of time.,0
1356," It's hard to phone a cab becasue we don't have cell numbers which they require,",1
1357, and it is a constant struggle and negotiation with the hotel to make local calls here.,1
1358," EVENTUALLY she secured a cab to take her,",0
1359, and after a half hour's wait it arrived.,0
1360,"***Note: I wrote this days ago (Saturday morning) but haven't had internet access since,",1
1361, I also don't have a fast enough connection to upload any pictures.,0
1362,The internet seems to have cut out (good bye 100 rupees) so I’ll write this entry in Word and hopefully I can upload it later.,0
1363," ate the delicious hotel breakfast,",0
1364, So when we arrived at the wedding Sagar and Deepa were both up a the front of a giant room under a lavishly decorated tent awning.,1
1365, but we had a decent view.,0
1366, (food has not been an issue on this trip!,0
1367," After lunch we went back in to the wedding room for a bit because we were told the couple was going to do a fire ceremony of some kind,",0
1368, we went back to our rooms to change out of our fancy Indian clothes and into western clothes to hit the mall.,1
1369, This time we weren’t going to mess around with cabs – we just walked up to the road and grabbed some rickshaws.,1
1370," Apparently ten years ago there wasn’t even kissing allowed in Bollywood movies,",1
1371,Once the movie was finished it was time to grab rickshaws and get back to the hotel to get ready for the reception.,1
1372, so we asked the hotel to call us a cab.,0
1373, I thought you were talking about a different hotel” then he demanded 500 rupees!,0
1374, I’ve had enough of these games!,0
1375," especially since Anjali couldn’t speak Hindi well enough to get the words out when she was mad,",1
1376,The hotel where the reception was held was absolutely gorgeous.,0
1377, Sagar was waiting in the lobby when we arrived and it was great to get a chance to chat with him.,1
1378," We managed to score a round table at the side though,",0
1379, and she had offered to help us book a car to take us to a National Park just outside of town since we had such difficulty arranging transportation.,0
1380, So we asked the hotel to call Sagar to ask him to call his friend to find out what the deal was.,1
1381," We weren’t sure who exactly the hotel spoke to,",1
1382, we were ready to leave the hotel lobby.,0
1383," Unfortunately it cost more than admission to be allowed to take photos,",1
1384,After MickeyDee’s we walked back to our hotel and chilled out for a few hours before heading out on the town.,1
1385, We were a bit nervous about whether we would be able to get a rickshaw back but luckily some were waiting outside.,1
1386,"The boys and Vanessa stayed up a bit more to finish of the “wine” from the other day,",1
1387, but I went back to my room to update the travelblog.,0
1388, We’re checking out of our hotel to head north to town where Deepa is from.,1
1389, Right now we’re just waiting for a car to come get us… we’ll see if it shows up!,0
1390, They charge 1300/- per person for day trip and much more for night halts.,0
1391," Although there is no good hotel in Muthathi,",0
1392," On the way back we took Masala Dosa on a better looking hotel in Kanakpura,",1
1393, accommodation is available at Bheemeswari Jungle lodges which is expensive and not worth for people who can return back on the same day.,1
1394, The big hiccup for me was the lack of internet access in Frankfurt during our stopover.,0
1395, what major airports don't have internet access these days?,0
1396," conducting interviews for a hiring committee,",0
1397," But once we landed I texted Brodie and he said they were waiting for us,",0
1398, What troopers - it was like 1:30am by the time we left and the trip back to the hotel took about 45 minutes.,0
1399, We had two cars: one was driven by a hired driver but Sagar drove the other one himself.,1
1400, but we all made it to our hotel eventually.,0
1401," but I had not trouble sleeping well in my hotel bed once I settled in,",0
1402, She was arriving at 12:30 in the afternoon on a domestic flight from Dehli where she has been staying with family for the last two weeks.,1
1403, Sagar had arranged for another car to pick Vanessa and I up from the hotel to go to the airport to grab Anj and bring her back.,1
1404, Anj had arrived at the airport and still no car had shown up at the hotel to get me and Vanessa.,1
1405, The other issue was that without an Indian mobile (cell phone) we have a terrible time communicating with anyone.,1
1406," So when the car didn't come we had to get the hotel to call Sagar's mobile,",1
1407, which they were hesitant to do for us (only some of the hotel staff are helpful.,0
1408," Much texting was going on through a web-based text service because Anjali had wifi at the Bangalore airport,",0
1409, but we were paying for wifi by the hour at our hotel.,0
1410, Eventually Anjali just worked up the courage to take a taxi by herself to the hotel.,0
1411," We asked the hotel to call us a taxi,",0
1412," He wanted us to pay to hire him for 4 hours,",0
1413, It turns out that was a bit of a miscommunication and now we know the difference between a metered taxi and hiring a driver.,1
1414," The hotel clearly has a vested interest in hiring cars because they constantly push us to get them,",0
1415," We texted the driver's mobile number to Kamini before we left the wifi zone of the hotel,",0
1416, so they were lenient and stayed open a bit later for us.,0
1417, The boys went shopping while us girls went off to a little local salon that Kamini knows well.,1
1418,From there we swung by an Indian clothing shop because I wanted to get an Indian outfit for the engagment party that night.,1
1419, Kamini said the shop we were going to had really well priced stuff so it would be a quick win.,1
1420,"Before heading to the hotel and the party,",0
1421, we headed back to the hotel so Anjali and I could get dressed.,0
1422, but they were serving important functions and they couldn't be given up.,0
1423," After a search my bag and hotel room,",1
1424," I managed to find one straight pin and a small """"BEAVERS CANADA"""" pin with a safety pin style back.",1
1425,Eventually we snuck off to our rooms as things were winding down.,0
1426, I should get a chance for some more writing tomorrow morning because we will probably have a bunch of time waiting for a car to pick us up (we are going up north to Deepa's village for a continuation of the marraige ritual stuff).,1
1427, I returned to my hotel room in Mysore.,0
1428, My brain clicked and I checked with the Hotel reception immediately.,0
1429, hotel manager replied.,0
1430,top gears and climate was cozy enough to enjoy every moment of it.,1
1431, I walked out of the bus stand and found a fellow in mid-forties waiting with his three wheelers.,1
1432, I walked further ahead and found that entire campus was huge and maintained with utmost creativity and serenity.,1
1433," Ayub was waiting for me and he clutched his """"Merc"""" faster to Sera Je.",1
1434, I interacted with a few more monks and tried to learn about their routines and how they feel staying furthest from home.,0
1435, I asked Ayub whether these monks allow other tourists to stay in their hostels then I could give it a try for a night.,0
1436,Befriended with during my stay in Bylakuppe for just more than 16 hours.,1
1437, stay tuned).,0
1438,"We got to the Hotel Everest,",0
1439," The hotel had a great rooftop terrace and restaurant,",1
1440, so keep enough time margin on hand.,1
1441, Your Dandeli hotel would invariably arrange for a pickup at a small cost or local taxis are available just outside both Londa or Karwar station for Dandeli.,1
1442,Our booking was at Kali Adventure camp run by Jungle Lodge & Resorts and was for riverside facing tents.,1
1443, Gives you fairly an adventurous atmosphere without sacrificing the comforts we city people are accustomed to!,1
1444, don’t wait for next day.,0
1445, Rafting charges are not included in the hotel package and currently the rate is Rs 1300 per person.,1
1446, The hotel arranges for the tour including pick up and drop in a jeep to the rafting point.,1
1447," heavy clothing are not allowed as when wet,",0
1448," Your life jacket allows you to stay afloat,",0
1449, More so when the your guide quietly informs everyone that there are crocodiles in the river!,0
1450," Charges Rs 500 for it,",0
1451,"Its late evening by the time you come back to the resort but a nice surprise awaits you there,",0
1452, Bring your own bottles if you want to enjoy more (offitially not allowed but everybody had brought one and kept hidden in paper bags!,1
1453," It might be a good idea to actually stay for two days,",0
1454," the resort is not in deep jungle as one expects it to be and second it is bit overpriced for the kind of facility and food offered (Rs 2,",1
1455, The counter got us extremely reasonable priced excellent taxi for further 5 days trip.,1
1456,"Tip : You can get very cheap rates at Kulgi forest camp (Rs 400 per night) but it is actually nowhere deep in the forest,",1
1457, your own vehicles are not allowed inside the jungle.,0
1458, Yana and stay for the night at Jog Falls.,0
1459," Got a good rate from the resort for a Ford Toofan ( a 10 seater) ,",1

1461, the guy charged us only Rs 7.,0
1462, You are not allowed to wear footwear so be ready to get some painful jabs from stones.,1
1463,Back to civilization but at Sirsi we were informed that going to Jog falls (highest waterfall of India?,1
1464, offers wonderful staying facilities.,0
1465,"We decided to go across and stay at the island,",0
1466, so makes sense to park your vehicle on this side and take the boat across if you want to stay on the island or visit the sites on other side.,1
1467," The other side had lines of back packer resorts one after another,",1
1468, the room rates were much lower than next door resorts offering same kind of stuff.,1
1469," actually some of the hotels close down during these months simply because the temperature crosses 45* C and since all the sites are in open,",0
1470, The standard rickshaw charges for a 3 hour ride around is Rs 350 – 400 and for a Tata Magic Rs 650 .,1
1471," climb down and back to the resort for a well deserved round of drinks and wonderful dinner,",1

1474," Its not allowed now to be shown at Sangeet mahal pillars (whatever remaining there are),",1
1475,Stayed at Badami just opposite bus stand.,0
1476,Tip : The Karnataka tourism hotel is way out of the place and not worth staying.,1
1477, It seemed like a ghost hotel where everything was locked up.,0
1478, but we see this rule being totally forgotten by most of our muslim rulers.,1
1479, It was filled with water and the canon firing staff had 12 seconds after lighting the ignition to jump in this pit and stay inside the water.,1
1480, The highway is totally congested with truck traffic and takes good enough more than 3 hours against our expectation of 2 hours.,0
1481, So keep enough margin if you are traveling this stretch.,1
1482, Getting to Hampi on the hard plastic chair of the standard public bus for 10hrs had not been comfortable in any way so i thought it was an investment to get a nights sleep on the trip back to the coast.,0
1483, And the part where they dumped all the people not headed to Goa (to Gokarna) in the middle of nowhere by the road at 2am to wait for an uncomfortable minibus to come collect us.,1
1484," After 2 hours of waiting and making a fuss with a local hotel owner who seemed to know the driver,",0
1485, the hotel owner drove to the minibus driver's house to wake him up.,1
1486, Although it went against every mental calculation I made we actually managed to fit 6 women (and all their rucksacks and daysacks) onto 1 auto-rickshaw for the journey.,0
1487,"Our hotel was in the """"outskirts"""" of Bangalore,",1
1488, we ran into some car issues that took away the rest of the day.,0
1489,If I manage to meet up with Natalie in Kerela!,0
1490, we (and the rickshaw) prevailed and got into Bangalore early enough to visit a mechanic and pamper our wheels with a tune up for a job well done!,1
1491," I checked in to a small Hotel in Bangalore and when called up Gaurav and asked him to accompany me for my dream tour to Malnad region,",0
1492," Buses from Bangalore to Hassan ply in every 10-15 minutes and depending upon the comfort level and your pocket size,",1

1494, We switched buses and hoped in to a standard KSRTC bus which was absolutely waiting just for us.,1
1495, we found 'Hotel Soundarya Residency' fit within our budget and seemed a decent family hotel.,1
1496," After completing the check in formalities and the moment we entered 'room 205' the first reaction came from Gaurav,",1
1497,Next day early at 6am one Indica honked in front of our hotel and we were ready to hit the road.,1
1498,first place we stopped was a tea shop on the Chickmagalur-Kemmangudi road.,1
1499,Ravi told us previously that we needed to hire a Jeep from Kemmangudi to drive further 15kms to reach Hebbe.,1
1500, Somehow we managed to grab a 'grip'.,1
1501, we maintained to walk down the stream.,0
1502, We stopped in a place at Attigundi for lunch and managed with steaming 'Chapathis and Chicken Masala'.,1
1503,Ravi was waiting with his car.,1
1504,A taxi would cost Rs.,0
1505,Where to stay; Chikmagalur has staying options aplenty.,0
1506, Starting from star category hotels to the budget family ones.,1
1507, We stayed at Hotel Soundarya Resinency.,1
1508,"Room rates are 900/- AC Double,",1
1509, There is no facility to stay there overnight.,0
1510, children provided you have enough strength to go up.,1

1512, pyramid valley provides many facilities for free.,0
1513, Photography is not allowed in this area and inside pyramid.,0
1514, Children below 6 years are not allowed inside the pyramid as they might create noise inside.,0
1515,You are not allowed to carry your food to do picnic in Pyramid valley.,0
1516, The area is quite large and is enough to keep you busy walking and exploring various small items.,1
1517, The place is a must see for everybody staying in Bangalore and nearby.,1
1518, The philosophy of volunteering here is that the work you do both meets of the needs of the volunteer and those of the organisation.,0
1519," For the women the health issues relate to prenatal and antenatal care,",1
1520," the issues are respiratory,",0
1521,"come into my shop"""" echoes down the street and rickshaws crawl along beside you just in case after saying no five times you miraculously change your mind.",1
1522," lined with sari shops and spice sellers,",0
1523, It manages to balance perfect simplicity with the most elaborate detail and is far more beautiful than I had imagined.,1
1524, Jodhpur was much smaller and therefore more manageable than the other cities we had visited.,1
1525," The fort itself was also my favourite out of the many we saw in Rajathan because it was really well-maintained and there was a free audio-tour,",1
1526, which was long enough I think (some people do it for nearly two weeks - I think saddle-sore would be an understatement!,0
1527, we managed to book a ticket through our hostel for the following morning.,0
1528, we set off in a taxi to Nizamuddin Railway Station only to find that our train was departing in a month's time.,1
1529, This one was delayed by 5 hours so we spent a thrilling afternoon in a waiting room at Jaipur Railway Station.,1
1530," I managed to find myself a fantastic waterproof,",0
1531, Sharing a bed with both my bags isn't the most comfortable but we have 3 more sleepers booked for South India so I better get used to it!,1
1532, There's so much more I could have written but I think that's probably enough for now as I'm in a very sweaty internet cafe (in Bangalore).,0
1533, Second come humans who can choose to be good or bad—issue of karma comes into this.,0
1534, One incident here was at a high end hotel in Jaipur.,1
1535, I handed in my room key and was handed a customer service questionnaire.,1
1536,room number.,0
1537,"Ons Hotel belooft ons een onneembaar zicht op de grandeur van Mysore Palace,",1
1538,Helaas is fotograferen hier ook verboden (maar dank zij internet kan je hier een volledige rondgang volgen).,0
1539,30am and stopped on the edge of the city to admire the Malik-E-Maidan or in English the Monarch of the Plain an extremely large 55 tonne canon left to rust on one of the cities external walls before looking for a decent hotel room.,0
1540, I took a few dawn photos of the tomb before returning to the hotel for breakfast.,1
1541, Eventually late in the day we pulled into another nondescript ugly Indian town called Beed where we stayed in the only hotel we could find.,1
1542,30am we arrived at Shiva’s Underground Temple where the driver was waiting and he showed us an ancient military dining area where a long line of plates had been carved into some rocks near an aqueduct.,1
1543,what do all these people do when they stay near the beach?,0
1544, enough with the philosophical bullshit.,0
1545, We got down at the bus stop and hired an autorickshaw (tuk-tuk) and were charged Rupees 250 to take us the 12kms to the Turtle Bay beach resort.,1
1546," I had made a reservation online for a small standard room (Rupees 1000/night) for two days,",1
1547, but when we got there we were told that the rooms were unavailable as the people staying there had extended the stay.,1
1548, The room was clean and laid artistically with typical village style windows (check out the pics) and a cement slab cot.,1
1549," It was neat and comfortable and with the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks on the coast,",1
1550, The property's USP is the presence of rock boulders on the coast with crevices big enough for a person to walk-in and the resort is surrounded by fishing hamlets with boats neatly laid out.,1
1551, and so settled to shop for some beads (Pavi is crazy about beads) in the little shops that line almost every temple in India.,1
1552,"After staying in Varkala for more than we intended (don't get me wrong,",1
1553," hiring houseboats (beautiful and luxurious boats,",1
1554," with 2 or more rooms on the boat,",0
1555, but trust my word when I say the luxury costs as well).,1
1556, as we were told it is best to look for and hire a boat by yourself than to have an agency organise your trip around the backwaters.,0
1557," who was offering us a motor boat for a decent price,",0
1558," Our boat man tried to give us some information about the backwaters,",0
1559, when Jan and I could hardly stay serious any more.,0
1560," asking us same questions 6 or 7 times (how long will you stay in Alleppey,",0
1561," A guy just told us to wait at the side of the road,",0
1562," as I managed to ruin one of our torch lights and lose another one,",1
1563,"Another short drive as we arrived in the ancient city of Mysore around midday and dumped our bags at the hotel I had booked the previous evening,",1
1564, it is clean and comfortable and within just a few minutes’ walk of the palace.,0
1565, We decided that we would go visit the further afield sights immediately then dismiss the driver as we will be staying for a few days.,0
1566," we then went to a couple of expensive shops so the driver could get commissions,",0
1567, although it is gaudy and only a small portion is open to the public I then visited the shop where I purchased some souvenirs.,0
1568,"We then travelled to Hassan an unpleasant busy town where we stayed the night,",1
1569," the Hoysala were the dominant Hindu empire in this part of India for a number of centuries managing to fight of the Muslims off for a number of years before eventually being defeated,",1
1570,On the way back to Hassan we stopped at a resort for lunch and decide to stay there the night rather than return to that ugly town.,1
1571, they offered us a choice of rooms and we were upgraded to a club room with a view of the arabian sea.,1
1572, we explored the hotel and discussed a day trip with travel desk.,1
1573," We arrived at the coffee shop and i chose a mangalore thali with the fish and chicken,",1
1574, my husband ordered a nasi goreng and after a little rest we left for sun and sand resort which was right on the beach.,1
1575, entry to the resort also came with snacks and we spent some time at the coffee shop overlooking the beach and viewed some of the rooms and then got into the water.,1
1576, we saw this beautiful sunset and returned to the hotel after a detour to see the docks.,1
1577,back to the hotel we packed and left our bags at the reception and sat in the coffee shop having club sandwiches and a beer.,1
1578, i was happy to find a gateway hotel coming up in kolkata.,1
1579, i also picked up a fridge magnet from the hotel shop and we left for the airport.,1
1580, at the airport i managed to find the hotel keys in my bag and called them and left them with the jet airways counter.,1
1581, As the bus drivers cab just about passed ours the bus driver swung violently left and directly into us.,1
1582, Fortunately we managed to stop very quickly but the bus had by this point scrapped past the right hand side of our truck with some force.,0
1583,"Mark and room buddy Peter,",1
1584,30 a few of us set off from our hotel for Hanuman temple.,1
1585, We set off early in the morning and hired Chevrolet Tavera for the same.,1
1586, It was enough for us as we were six guys in the team.,0
1587, There were many boards with information and direction as it was a tourist spot and there were different camps as well.,1
1588," Some of the fun filled activities organized by Thrillophilia in Bheemeshwari and Muthathi include nature camps,",1
1589, I stayed ahead of the rest of the pack most of the trek to capture some pics of our team in action.,1

1591, When we finished the stretch we were picked up by the jeep waiting at the other end which took us back to the spot.,0

1597,No cameras were allowed inside.,0
1598,The greatest room was the large durbar room where the Maharaja met with officials.,1
1599,"The full public durbar room was a gigantic covered room,",1
1600,"Allowed fifteen minutes for photography outside the Palace,",0
1601, The Indians naturally regard the Tipu Sultan as a hero betrayed by his Prime Minister who informed the British about how to enter the Fort; Cornwell portrays him as a Hindu patriot.,1
1602," The interior rooms are painted with intricate designs,",1
1603,After lunch was an organized shopping expedition.,1
1604," The first shop had shawls,",0
1605, The next shop was a honey-trap for me: the government shop with fixed prices at a large fabric counter.,1
1606, but the dark red was not quite purple enough – still it will work.,1
1607, so bought enough to make new cushion covers ($41.,0
1608, Cheap at the factory: 100 rupees for 226 grams of green tea.,1
1609, We decided to treat ourselves to a taxi to Hampi rather than having to wait 4 hours and then boarding another train for 3 hours.,0
1610, The 3 hours taxi ride was worse than the 26 hours on the train.,0
1611, We hired a bike for a fews days and explored the area.,0
1612, He only managed to save 4 out of 12 bananas.,0
1613, I never thought I could stay this long in a place without a beach!,0
1614, We also have a large number of Indian men staying in the dorm behind us hopefully they will keep their noise down.,1
1615," unfortunately the Indians in the dormitory were drunk and making a hell of a noise so around 11pm I had had enough and I blasted them,",1
1616, This hammock was only big enough for one bear so we went back to work to build a larger version.,1
1617," After another boring Indian lunch we all moved to the conference room where we were issued the questions that the dignitary wanted us to ask him and then the farce began,",1
1618,"After ten hours sleep in a comfortable bed I awoke feeling refreshed a good hour before breakfast,",1

1620,"When 11am came we met Joanne another volunteer from South Australia who was also staying at our hotel and three English ladies,",1
1621, I lugged our packs out to the vehicles parked in the street and we headed off to another hotel to pick up another Australian couple from Sydney.,0
1622,"Another volunteer arrived during lunch this one from Victoria,",0
1623, I liked the three volunteers from Sydney as well and in particular the couple in their forties and of course the Adelaide girl.,1
1624," After dinner we went to the games room where we watched a documentary on the plight of the wild Tiger in India,",1
1625," Our fellow volunteers were complaining about the cold night,",1
1626,After breakfast we went to the conference room for our induction and information session regarding the history of the Sloth Bear program and how Wildlife SOS India had managed to remove all the dancing bears from Indian roadsides it was an amazing story.,1
1627," We then piled into vehicles for the bumpy ride out to the sanctuary and a guided tour of the facility lead by Doctor Arun ,",1
1628," vet and sanctuary manager who showed us the surgery,",0
1629," Nadi one of the Indian volunteers returned some twenty minutes later and then we were on our way to one of the den’s where we helped feed the bears with a concoction that looks like a chocolate milkshake in big metal pans,",1
1630," we awoke early and delivered the girls to my mum’s where they will stay for a while before going to the kennel for a few weeks,",1
1631,We tend to catch the bus to the airport and get a cab back but the bus is annoyingly slow today and even though the connecting bus was waiting when we arrived.,0
1632, fortunately we organised a driver to pick us up and deliver us to our MG Road hotel which was quite a quick trip at 2am.,1
1633, After about five hours in the traffic we grabbed a quick meal and returned to our very comfortable hotel.,1
1634,"The most shocking aspect of my stay in Jaisalmer,",0
1635," her partner Matt and I checked into an overflow building of a hotel strongly recommended by our guidebook,",0
1636, only to find it overpriced and the room uncomfortably small.,1
1637," and checking into a friendlier and more comfortable hotel for less than half the price,",1
1638, The only thing that could be done from 11am-4pm was nap under a fan in the hotel room.,1
1639," and to guzzle bottles of cold water that your hotel sells from a small fridge behind the check-in counter,",1
1640, The most annoying thing is the first time you lose an entire e-mail you’ve spend an hour typing out on a barely functioning computer with keys that stick or are missing.,1
1641, you soon start to take note of which Internet cafes have generators and fans to get your through the blackout times when it is too hot to go outside or stay in your room.,1
1642," there are several hotel options inside of it,",1
1643," and in particular sewage disposal issues causing severe damage to the fort,",1
1644, we pondered and then decided to give Jaisalmer’s legal bhang (marijuana) shop a miss.,1
1645," Having a pre-dinner drink alone in my room just before meeting up with Leanne and Matt,",1
1646, I took a hearty swig of the syrup and locked my room to go rouse Leanne and Matt.,0
1647, but suffice to say that we didn’t stay in the restaurant for very long.,0
1648,power was out on our walk back and we could not see a thing as we tried to navigate our way back to our hotel through a network of black alleyways.,1
1649, I had purchased an amazing hand carved silver ring that shows a dozen or so Indian gods in stunning detail from a shop that was located at the end of the Fort Palace tour.,1
1650, Nowhere near as much traffic as elsewhere and some of it even makes the odd attempt to comply with the rules of the road.,1
1651," and people who have set up shop on blankets,",0
1652, waiting for trains to arrive.,0
1653," Inside was a large air-conditioned room with leather couches,",0
1654," It seemed highly unfair that just because we were tourists we got to lounge comfortably on couches,",0
1655, we waited comfortably until a tourist official told us our train arrived and directed us where to go.,0
1656,"a 3AC ticket,",0
1657, 3AC is miles above Sleeper class (non air conditioned) and it is luxury compared to the non-reservable chair class.,1
1658," Our hotel was located 250meters from the main gate of the Taj,",1
1659, We dropped our bags in our room and headed to the main gates of the Taj while the weather was still good.,1
1660," a procession of rickshaws and tuk-tuks waited for us outside the hotel; they followed us down the road all the way to the gates,",1
1661," That evening we decided to check out the “Hotel Oberoi”,",0
1662," and is one of the most expensive hotels in India,",0
1663," with rooms costing up to 5,",0
1664," Just to get to the hotel entrance you have to first go through a set of security gates,",0

1666, We arrived at hotel Pearl Palace and were blown away by the place.,0
1667," The rooms were big,",0
1668," The hotel had a tandoori oven,",0
1669, We walked around for a few hours before sensory overload kicked in and we headed back to our hotel sanctuary for dinner.,1
1670, The next day we hired a tuk-tuk and driver for the day to take us to see a number of sights outside of the city.,1
1671, and wait in the parking lot for you while you tour various sights.,0
1672, where we ushered into a room with men trying to sell us printed fabrics!,1
1673,"present day Maharaja stays in this palace when he is in Jaipur,",1
1674," Just a few showers are enough to transform parched dustiness and arid baked landscapes into lush,",1
1675," wait for the landslide to be cleared/the overflowing road to drain/the rain to stop,",1
1676," Oh wait…After ten minutes of alternating between using the menu as fan,",1
1677, persuaded the guesthouse to allow us to set up a tab saying as we are staying here for a month.,1
1678, Our dreams of regular pitstops for air conditioning and ice cream were quickly quashed as it quickly became evident that RKay’s management haven’t quite yet grasped the fundamental concept that in order for a mall to function the shops actually need to open.,1
1679, We tried to buy a drink to pass the time from the seemingly fully staffed and stocked food court but were staunchly informed that they were not able to open for an hour (it was by this point 11am).,0
1680, hundreds of staff and volunteers and are carrying out interventions in rural Rajasthan ranging from education to forestry to microfinance to community forums addressing climate change.,1
1681, We were not able to meet our supervisor until 3pm so went to attempt to get ourselves a sim card in the meantime after reassurances from our volunteer coordinator Preeti that the Vodaphone shop was the answer to all our problems.,1
1682, On finally completing our epic trek and confirming that the glorious site of the Vodaphone shop (complete with no less than 4 air conditioning units) was in fact real and not a heat-induced mirage we were informed that though we would definitely be able to get a sim-card (progress) we were still considered imminent enough terrorist threats that they would need to see our passports.,1
1683, Not sure a 40p-per-message charge means much to organisations that can afford mass explosives.,0
1684,) shops topped by several golden domes.,1
1685, We attempted to do some shop browsing which was a far from relaxing experience due to the female shop assistants following us around at the heels whilst the men simply took to standing virtually on top of us.,1
1686, Where we found Han and two other volunteers from her NGO.,0
1687, The process of simply ordering and then paying for food was clearly deemed far too dull so the management have introduced a wonderful system where you have to load a (naturally not-free) plastic card with cash and then use that to purchase your food.,1
1688, Definitely the more comfortable than any bed we have encountered so far (they are a fan of the firm/wooden mattress over here); so much so that Han sacrificed a portion of the film for a little snooze!,1
1689,From our hotel window you could see the fort and palace rising up from the hillside.,1
1690, The ticket office had informed us that it would only take 15 minutes to reach the fort.,0
1691, The warden unlocked a padlocked door and showed us a room covered with the golden painting the Maharanas and the battles they fought.,1
1692, so he literally lightens up the room every time he enters.,0
1693," we were both pretty disappointed: I think the problem is,",0
1694, the main issue was the tourists :/ coach load after coach load turned up.,1
1695," Strangely enough it was seeing one poor dog dying on the roadside,",0
1696,"We woke up at dawn in Agra and headed out our hotel to catch our taxi ride,",1
1697, same guy we hired for the Agra tour.,0
1698, he was not there and so we could not afford to wait longer so we took a tuk tuk from the area to the train station.,1
1699, waiting with hope for the next day or taking a private taxi with the rest of the tourists.,1
1700," We had already seen everything in Agra so no point in staying another day,",0
1701, he tourists were trying to negotiate with a taxi and were not getting anywhere and well a train full of people with a backpack on your back and standing for 5 hours.,0
1702, We were a little annoyed at tuk tuks and decided to walk to the budget hotel area that Lonely Planet recommended.,1
1703, As we walked on small sidewalks not always very well maintained we started to feel the heat of the Rajasthan desert.,1
1704, Even though we only had a very small map Kyle managed to navigate us in an excellent manner all the way to the hotel area.,1
1705," We passed a few Indian hotels near the train station,",0
1706, but at the same time we saw a few hotels and guesthouses.,0
1707, We walked in the recommended budget hotel from LP but it was all booked so we kind of wandered around and every other tuk tuk driver will say ¨where are you going?,1
1708, until this one man started to talked to us and even followed us walking leaving his tuk tuk with the engine on in the middle of the street telling us there was an ok not so expensive hotel nearby.,1
1709, We asked for one room and it was 700 rupees an ok price and so we stayed there.,1
1710, So we chilled in the hotel for a bit and completely passed out until about 8 o´clock.,1
1711," As we were waiting for our waiter,",0
1712," The younger boy was hiding and was in charged of the two puppets a kind,",1
1713, The older boy was in charged of playing the drums and the other was in charge of playing an Indian instrument and make the music.,1
1714, They would do their homework and at 4 they would come to the hotel restaurant to work until about 12 midnight.,0
1715, Kyle gave them a few coins from Canada and China and we said our good byes to head to our room for the night.,1
1716, We packed our bags and left them int he hotel storage for the day.,1
1717, The City Palace had been restored and well maintained and it was more like a museum.,1
1718, but you were technically not allowed to go in or on them.,1
1719," We wandered for a bit until we managed to find an exit to go on the top of the roof of the palace and se Amer fort and Jaigarh Fort,",1
1720, We found an American café where we ate some samosas and a doughnut and some lattes and frappuchinos and relaxed for a bit while waiting for the sun to lower so we could head out to Jaighar fort.,1
1721," Amer was known in the medieval period as Dhundar (meaning attributed to a sacrificial mount in the western frontiers) and ruled by the Kachwahas from the 11th century onwards – between 1037 and 1727 AD,",1
1722, but a pair of cheap Thai mary jane kind of shoes.,1
1723," I managed to climb all the way up and reached the top to see a bunch of monkeys,",1
1724, The driver was going to take us to his fathers shop but we said no firmly and finally he took us to what looked like a big slump.,1
1725, Now there was only a small room where people chant and pray but the main area is all in ruins.,1
1726, When we got to the hotel we got off the tuk tuk and were about to give him the 600 rupees we had agreed to pay him for the day when the guy realized that we had spend more than what he actually had said and wanted about 3000 rupees.,1
1727,"We got our hotel room,",0
1728, We went out to get some snacks and drinks and then headed to our room to relax for the evening!,1
1729," We headed out the hotel with a clear view of where we wanted to go,",1
1730, We walked through a few alleys and then headed back to the hotel realizing we were not going to find any souveniers in this area.,1
1731," We walked back to our hotel and took a shower,",0
1732, and chapatti with chai as we waited until it was time to leave for our night train to Jaisaimer.,1
1733,"Harry was waiting for us at nine and we left our lovely retreat,",1
1734, probably the loveliest place we have stayed for a long time.,0
1735, wait now it comes and women are digging out a channel for the rain when it comes.,1
1736,We finally arrived at our hotel about 7 and at last had Internet although at a cost.,0
1737," Our favourite place was Jaipur with its colourful shops and wide streets with camels,",1
1738, but to stop jealousy they weren’t allowed into each other’s rooms and he even had a secret passage so they didn’t know who he was visiting !,1
1739, There was even a swimming pool where the king would come to choose his lady and a massive courtyard with a huge board type game where the ladies would dance across according to the throw of the dice !,1
1740, leased it to the ruling British.,0
1741," a lady manager kindly volunteered to give us a guided tour of what was clearly once a state-of the-art processing plant but whose boilers and conveyors were now rusting away,",1

1743,of the day and the sauna of a bunk had lulled us into a false sense of comfort which we realised as the temperature began to plummet drastically after sunset.,0
1744,Udaipur was a welcome rest for us as we knew we were staying 3 nights so could relax a bit and take our activities down a notch.,1
1745, We stayed in a lovely old haveli right on the edge of the lake.,0
1746, This is also the setting for the James Bond Octopussy film which is screened at different hotels around the lake as the city's claim to fame.,1
1747,We went to the old palace as we got some free tickets from some rich French tourists when we were having a beer in a posh hotel on the lake.,1
1748, It was impressively big and recently we have been getting more of a visual representation of what the fort or palace rooms would have looked like in the more recent places we have visited.,0
1749, was on the more tacky and gaudy side leaving us wondering how you could have so many intricately mirrored and tiled rooms without getting a headache.,0

1759,people start forming the queue as early as 10 am we simply completed the check-in formalities and rushed immediately to the booking office.,0
1760," We had selected the Resort being just about 2 kms away from the main entrance to the Tiger Reserve,",1
1761, On reaching there we saw that there were 2 different queues for Gypsy Safari (6 people other than guide and driver) and Canter Safari (16-20 people other than guide and driver).,0
1762, Our preference was obviously for the Gypsy Safari and there were hardly about 7-8 people in the queue whereas for the Canter Safari there were more than 50 people.,1

1773, This time I managed to do some setting and jumped the queue and got the ticket within an hour (I normally don’t ever do this but having been in the queue for 3 hours in the morning was not prepared to go through the same again).,1

1779," Het hotel is weer een voormalig paleis (Prince Charles en Camilla hebben hier ook overnacht),",1
1780, which looked like a group of guys munching their kebabs waiting for a taxi at half 4 on a Sunday morning struggling to stand up due the severe intoxicated state that they’re in.,1
1781," As we at down I was informed that this was a vegetarian restaurant,",1
1782," I got over this issue and witnessed another funny incident that we were all talking about later that night,",1

1802," a few of us took advantage of the hotel pool,",0
1803, although it wasn't the cleanest pool I've ever been in.,0
