761,Bonjour and welcome to the second instalment of my Asia travel blog.,1
762, Welcome to India.,1

766, A few balls are prepared with sugar and other spices to be broken up and have more ghee added to form tumera (adding dried fruits and nuts) which is served as a sweet with the meal.,1

777, i specially enjoyed the sweet dosa and payesam and we met the bride and groom one last time and left for mangalore.,1
778, a short and sweet trip to mangalore ended with biryani.,1
779," for one they contribute almost nothing financially to the local community and they seem to have no political agenda (anymore),",1
780," or are at least completely impotent/uninterested in progressing any form of political agenda,",1
781, Maybe I’m wrong but I always imagine the early hippies of the 60’s to have had a political agenda (albeit a little naive) and to do some actual protesting in between getting wasted.,1
782, so I guess ultimately they help a little by being a tourist attraction of sorts.,1
783," the scenic place offers ample opportunities for nature walks and sightseeing,",1
784," Despite having been to western ghats and born and brought-up in a place (Kerala) where these kind of scenes are very much common,",1

793, The rest of the morning was spent pulling broken parts off another platform in an enclosure that was undergoing renovation before going crazy buying bear shirts and various other souvenirs to help the charity.,1
794, From here the scenery was not very pleasant the roads were lined with garbage; people here do not seem to understand the consequences of their actions or have any kind of social conscience where pollution is concerned.,1
795, it wasn’t as bad as it sounds the weather is lovely and the three kilometre walk was good exercise.,1
796," Nadi one of the Indian volunteers returned some twenty minutes later and then we were on our way to one of the den’s where we helped feed the bears with a concoction that looks like a chocolate milkshake in big metal pans,",1

828, The tuk tuk driver offered to take us around Jaipur´s sights the next day for 600 rupees.,1
829, We agreed and they sat us in front of a kind of old-fashioned puppet theatre booth and began the show.,1
830, I just loved the show and felt sensitive about these two boys who were about my nieces ages to be working late at night instead of being at home going to bed and being kids.,1
831," It was an open building with lots of cool and astrnomy aparatus that look kind of taken out of a theme park,",1
832, As we walked through the path and hallways of the inside of the palace we came across some kind of laberynth of entrances and up and down staircases.,1
833, kind of chilly and it made a good hiding place for bats.,1
834, We reached the exit of the pathway and were in a large open kind of terrace that lead to a steep hill.,1
835, but a pair of cheap Thai mary jane kind of shoes.,1
836, We paid an extra fee for one camera and headed in with soldier who apparently knew lots about the fort and so was kind of a tour guide.,1

869,and sparkly pens and each offering them for around 10p!,1
870,who stop to say hello like we were something special I thought to myself I could get used to this.,1
871, It just didn't feel right for me so I passed on the offer and chose to watch the others and discuss the rudeness of two people taking photos of a big group of locals we had been informed were praying for lost loved ones.,0
872, however adorning every surface was a carving to commemorate a loved one so it was quite a sad experience.,1
873, There were no goats or chickens but it did serve as a local bus.,1
874, We chose a particularly friendly one and were on our way.,1
875, The instructor was very kind and patient with us.,1

885, we were greeted with the most horrendous sound.,1
886, He was helped onto a black and white horse bedecked with ornamental bridle and saddle.,1
887, followed by the guests and the comically-dressed band with their booming cart.,1

889, each guest then making a suitable donation.,1
890, had been created to permit drinks and non-vegetarian food to be served hidden from the view of those observing strict vegetarian and teetotal lifestyles.,1
891, The treatment of dogs is particularly appalling in India; the sanctuaries education program is apparently succeeding in building community awareness as many citizens of Udaipur are now calling the hospital when they discover sick and injured animals.,1
892,We then visited the house where we signed the guest book before giving the sanctuary a $200 donation which will go a long way towards helping many more animals.,1
