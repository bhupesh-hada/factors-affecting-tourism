0,The Seattle/Paris leg of my journey was a delight.,1
1, I was brain-fried at this point and there wasn’t an area on my body that didn’t ache – such is the life of a road warrior.,1
2, It’s been a very long and tiring 2-day journey to get here.,0
3, Trains stop in stations from 1 minute to 8 – thankfully Agra qualified for the maximum 8 minutes which was definitely needed!,1
4," A couple of hours later we pull into Jhansi where my 4-hour bus ride is waiting to transport me to the next port of call: Khajuraho,",1
5,remove enough branches to be able to pull the entire trunk out of the road so we could continue our journey.,0
6, Not a single head turned as this vehicle careened down the highway – only those of us on the bus had any reaction to the spectacle.,0
7," By booking transport tickets online,",1
8,"We took the car directly to the train station,",1
9, With only a small delay we hopped on the train towards Agra.,0
10,"hour journey and it flew by,",0
11, It was time for my first train ride in India.,0
12, I had to get to the main train station in Delhi.,1
13, I then had to take a tuk-tuk to the station and I really didn't think about the price I got quoted and realised halfway into the journey that I was ripped off by about 80-100 rupees.,1
14,"At the train station,",1
15, And it was quite possibly the most antiquated train I have ever taken.,0
16," I was rather excited about this train ride - this is real travelling,",1
17,Our train left about 45 minutes late and constantly stopped in the middle of nowhere.,0
18, I'm guessing this is just Indian trains for you and I now realised why so many people were camped out on the train platforms.,0
19,Our driver first stopped about two hours into the journey at a local Hindu Temple.,0
20," The road got worse as we came closer and the traffic,",0
21, From where the bus dropped us it was a 500 metre walk along a brick paved road as the sky gradually lightened.,0
22, The train journey itself was really pleasant and we arrived in Agra in about 3.,1
23, We then got the train to Jaipur.,1
24, 40% cheaper and Lassi from road side shops.,1
25,The day after we were getting the train overnight to Kolkata to fly to Myanmar.,1
26, So I decided to have another strong Bhang lassi and sleep the journey away.,1
27, Somewhere between leaving the platform and taking my seat on the train my wallet either fell out of my pocket or was stolen.,1
28,"Getting the train there from Khajuraho was a bit annoying,",0
29," since there's only two trains that run per day,",0
30," If we went to the train station to get the ticket it might have been possible,",0
31,a waste of a day and the train was super hot.,0

34," but they give all that up to go on the so called final journey of Hinduism,",1
35,"We got the train the to Delhi that night,",1
36," This is the other train station in Delhi,",1
37, we sorted out visas for Myanmar and got all the remaining tickets for the trains we're going to need.,1

40,"When we left the train station,",1
41," We only had a couple of hours because he’d already arranged transport and tickets for the Taj Mahal at 3:30pm,",1
42, We had to pack up our bags for transfer to the train station later.,0
43, Our bags would be brought down and stored until we were ready to leave for the train to Agra.,1
44, we all went back to the hotel to wait our transfer to the train station.,0
45,” Our guide reminded us that we would not be able to get much to eat on the train and recommended we order something from the hotel to take with us.,0
46," Our train arrived and we all piled on,",1
47, so the tuk-tuk drivers left us off a bit further up the road so we could visit the more modern Mulagandhakuti Vihara temple which was already open.,1
48, so after retrieving our shoes we continued back down the road towards the main ruins.,0
49, we continued down the road and found the main entrance to the ruins.,1
50, we continued down the road and found the Standing Buddha.,1
51," so after grabbing a bottle of soda we walked back up the road until we found our tuk-tuk drivers,",1

59," who transported them to Delhi when he dropped us off at Khajuraho airport,",1
60, long journey of travelling from Sri Lanka.,0
61, This was when we told him we were heading to the train station to book a train for Rishikesh for after our intrepid trip.,0
62, He said that there was a government tourist office that could help foreigners book train tickets and we could get a map of Dehli from there.,1
63, We also got sent round to a back road office that was quite scary as it was at this point it was clear they were working in big groups and we felt really intimidated.,1
64,The next day we decided to venture out again to get to the train station to book our tickets to rishikesh.,1
65,"com now) It was a nice experience and we started to feel a little settled again once we ignored the curious and sometimes aggressive stares and the horrific roads of honking horns and near misses with tuk tuks,",0
66,We are now currently on our intrepid trip and after spending another day visiting a mosque in Dehli we caught a sleeper train to veranasi.,1
67,The overnight train left from Khajuraho and we were in some top bunks in sleeper class.,1
68, Twelve hours later and the train pulled up to Varanasi junction.,0
69, I really think that I'm going to focus a lot more on my flexibility training because I feel so good after doing so.,1
70, weight training and climbing but I seem to often neglect my flexibility or just half-ass it at the end of a training session.,0
71, We stopped along at a place to have breakfast and then continued from the ghats towards a busy road and visited two temples.,1
72, I walked down the ghat and then made the short journey to Siddarth's yoga studio.,0
73," Although my train from Varanasi was only much later,",0

75," No road rules,",0
76," We took an evening train from Jaipur,",1
77,"The train arrived quite late in the evening and after negotiating with several tuk-tuk's,",0
78, I was keeping my fingers crossed as I had an early train to catch the next morning.,0
79,Went to NewDelhi railway station in plenty of time to make sure I knew where to get train and its a good job I did.,1
80, Firstly my train seemed to be noticeably absent from the deoartures board so I asked at enquiries ( braving the scrum lol ) and found my train was going from platform 15.,0
81,On the platform I bought some bananas and oranges for the journey and settled down into my seat.,1
82,Left on time but onky had about half an hour before it got dark and couldn't se any more so resorted to playing games on the tablet and bought water and crisps from the train vendors.,1
83, and on the road for the long drive to Agra.,0
84, a 6am train from New Delhi station whisked us out of Delhi.,0
85,But we couldn't just sit in the hotel so after lunch we walked out to the main road to pick up a tuk-tuk rather getting them to call us a car (we're probably the only people staying there who didn't go everywhere by car and we were certainly the only people staying there with backpacks that we saw!,0
86,The following day we had been due to take a train in the evening to get back to Delhi but watching the previous few days trains it was clear that they had been badly affected by fog sometimes not arriving until the middle of the night so we had cancelled the train and booked a car.,1
87,"30/01/16 out of Rajasthan on my classy AC class train (SL full) to nearby Agra,",1
88," similar boomerang tactics as Delhi with a night train to Varanasi booked,",0
89," With my intended eatery on the same road as their hostel I ride back to main town with Loren & Francsoir,",0

91, sunrise boat trip then depart on an overnight train to Kolkata.,1
92, all the incredible modes of transport used by the Nawaabs.,1
93,"""""There are only two mistakes one can make along the road to truth; not going all the way,",0
94, has always been just too far out of the way of my bike journeys for easy access.,0
95, It claims to be a social organisation to provide character training through Hindu discipline and to unite the Hindu community.,1
96, road works and a general (much needed) sprucing up.,1
97," We set off from the hotel expecting to jump in a tuk-tuk however we ended up walking along the road which was crowded with cars,",0
98, Then we reached the narrow and winding roads near the Ghats.,0
99,That evening we went to get on our train to Jaipur to face another stressful railway station experience.,0
100," There was no other option but to get another train that night to Delhi,",0
101, we went to the railway station to get a train to Varanasi.,1
102,Our fond memories of the train to Agra were quickly forgotten.,1
103," You are advised to arrive 1 hour before your train to allow time to get yourself to the right platform,",1
104, but when we arrived at the station we saw that our train to Varanasi had been delayed by 3 hours.,0
105, So we braved the train platform for the last hour.,0
106, By this point we were desperate for the train to arrive.,0
107,When the train was about to come into the platform we had people trying to get us to go to different platforms which became very confusing and we became further flustered.,0
108," Once sitting in the right seats on the right train FINALLY,",0
109, trains in India rarely give any information at all about when the next stop will be or what stop it is.,0
110," The trains also stop on the tracks at any moment for unknown reasons,",0
111,Our first go at catching a train in India was surprisingly calm.,0
112, the carriages well marked and the train not too crowded.,1
113," As you navigate around the train station,",1
114, it is hard to tell who is lying on the ground sleeping whilst waiting for a train and who is sleeping on the ground permanently.,0
115, It is even harder to distinguish people who work at the train station and people who are trying to scam you for your money.,1
116," Luckily we had been pre warned about scam artists insisting that our train was cancelled,",1
117, delayed or that the platform had moved last minute so that they can offer you an alternative mode of transport at an extortionate price.,1
118," There is also a general carriage where the train is free,",1
119, but these carriages look very uncomfortable as people are squeezed into seats and can be seen hanging out of the doors and windows… sometimes for train journeys up to 50 hours long!,0
120, the first hitch of our journey had come about.,1
121, It started to take its toll as we waited on the train to Allahabad and hit hard.,0
122," It was a long 7 hour journey and not much sleep was had,",0
123, We had the trains booked already and the tuk tuk ordered for the morning pick up.,1
124,Well our first train was cancelled.,0
125,of the journey from Delhi to Varanasi was just as confusing.,0
126, We had 30 minutes before our trains departure!,0
127, We managed to find our train which was running late.,0
128, Catching a train in India just seems to be an ongoing nightmare - for us anyway.,0
129,Side note: There are direct trains available from Jaipur to Varanassi.,1
130," Anu explained that because the train was so late getting in,",0
131, we got on the night train to Varanasi.,0
132,We got on the train as planned at 10.,0
133, so one train had to wait off the line whilst the other one passes.,0
134, This is not unusual for trains in India!,0
135, This is the longest train journey ever!,1
136," One of the drivers had seen that the driver of our train had missed the red stop light,",0
137, the oncoming train was stopped.,0

140," so all the roads were now cut off,",0
141,"At Delhi train station,",1
142,""""" scammers outside of the station and entered the main hall and looked at the train information board.",0
143, We couldn't see our train number anywhere and our train was due to leave in 10minutes.,0
144,we managed to find our train and designated sleeper seats in time.,1
145," The 3 hour journey wasn't bad at all,",1
146, we actually found it quite pleasant and likened it to our train rides in China.,1
147," There were a few instances where severely disabled or visibly homeless people came round the train as it set off,",0
148, During the journey we also witnessed a eunuch (a castrated male dressed as a woman in a sari) clapping her hands and demanding money from certain passengers.,0
149, Afterwards we rested a little to prepare ourselves mentally for our first overnight train in India.,0
150,Entering the train station in Agra took us by surprise.,1
151, We understood the streets were chaotic but the train stations too!,0
152, up onto the train station's interior.,0
153, we watched as many trains came and went.,0
154,"After these trains left,",1
155, everything survived the trains by an inch.,0
156, With so many trains coming and going we questioned whether they were waiting for the same train.,1
157, Our train was initially on our platform screen but then disappeared.,0
158,The departure time for the train came and went.,0
159, We spotted some sort of train officials and ran to them to ask whether we had missed our train.,0
160, We asked what time the train was due.,0
161, We couldn't comprehend whether each train arriving was ours or not.,0
162,We believed we may have heard the word ‘Bundi’ in the announcement of one train that arrived over an hr later than the scheduled time of our train.,0
163, Chris ran off the train looking for another official P ran through the carriages.,0
164, As the train started moving Chris hopped back on and we found our seats.,1
165, Every traveller we had met on the road in South East Asia all who had travelled to India told us 'everyone' speaks English so we didn't need to worry about learning another language.,1
166,Transportation: Overnight train from Agra to Bundi.,1
167,"I boarded the train at Sawai Madhopur in general class,",0
168, visit the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort and catch a train later that evening to Varanasi.,1
169, It didn’t work out because there was no trains available to Varanasi that day.,0
170,At the station I booked a train to Varanasi for the next day and also a train from Varanasi to New Delhi for a couple of days later.,1
171, That was also a problem because the trains were full.,0
172,"In the evening I took a train to Varanasi and I was in the 3rd class sleeper,",0
173, where I had to board my train to New Delhi and I obviously wasn’t feeling a 100%.,1
174, I got to the station and walked all the way to the last platform where my train was departing from.,0
175, I asked when the next train to New Delhi was and they sold me a “general” ticket and there was no way I was going to sit for so long in packed wagon.,0
176, He said I should approach the employees on the train and pay them extra for an upgrade.,1
177,"train that had a 4 hour delay,",0
178, Wishful thinking; the train did not come!,1
179, The train came at 7:15am!,0
180, The train was constantly stopping in the middle of nowhere and most of the times it was going slow.,0
181, I got off the train in New Delhi at 1:30am.,0
182, I’m on the train to Agra.,0
183,"Lesson one - don’t give the train tickets to Richard,",0
184, back to stupid o clock and we got a tuk tuk to the train station-a different one from the one we arrived at.,1
185, In fairness the roads were so congested in the day that maybe the nighttime is the only time they can get anywhere.,0
186, It seems their road awareness was just as bad though when one reversed onto our side of the road and into our oncoming path.,0
187,Our train was already on the platform so we made our way through the rows of sleeping bodies and boarded.,0
188,So off the train and straight onto a bus for another 3 or so hours.,0
189, Halfway into the journey we stopped for lunch at a place called Sushams Haveli hotel and restaurant.,1
190," but given the train delay and problems at the border,",0

203,4 years ago whilst backpacking Thailand I shared my first night train with one of my best friends Sam (who I always call Delia as its her middle name) we had such a blast.,1
204, That train was only 2 tiers tho and a lot more space than this.,1
205, and a foreign night train without her was just no fun.,0
206, I think I needed this stinking train time to remind me of the things that had somehow gotten buried and lost.,1
207, We'd been on the train 4 and a half hours and I knew my bladder couldn't last another 7 hours.,0

220,"The train from Varanassi to Agra was fine,",1
221," Train arrived in Agra 3 hours later than scheduled time of 6am,",0

263, and has arranged train tickets for us up to Varanassi.,1
264, It included accomodation for one night in Agra but other than that little more than train tickets for a total of £98 per person.,1
