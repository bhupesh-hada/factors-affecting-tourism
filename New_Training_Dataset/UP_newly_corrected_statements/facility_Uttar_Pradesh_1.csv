16," the bus left the hotel and during the 30-minute drive to the river’s edge,",0
17, We stayed here for about an hour before finally turning around and heading back to our departure point.,0
18, Once at the airport our first challenge: we had to call the service desk to tell them to bring out the luggage as we were not allowed to enter the airport without a ticket.,1
19, But they all gave us the same answer: during work they are not allowed to make phone calls and they do not have a phone for that.,1
20," We waited the 5 indian minutes they told us to wait (which were about 20 """"real"""" minutes) - and then,",0
21, Happily we received the luggage and then even discovered an ATM which gave out cash.,1

23, And the queues were mainly terribly long.,0
24, We have heard of murders (luckily haven't seen anything like this) and injuries of people waiting for ATMs.,1

40, having a drink with our fellow travellers and then dinner in the Buffet of the hotel but an early night was needed.,1
41, Atul introduced us to an official photographer who came with us and took photos of the group and individual couples which would be waiting for us after our visit.,1
42, We walked all round this central room and saw the stone coffins lying side by side decorated beautifully.,1
43, Then it was time to leave this magic place and return to the hotel for breakfast.,1
44,We left the hotel again at 10-30 and our first stop was at a stone cutting workshop where they use the time honoured methods seen in the decoration of the Taj.,1
45, We were shown how they do the inlays and then taken to the shop where we eventually bought a beautiful marble plate with a traditional design.,1

54,) and embarked upon what we thought would be an easy enough 40 minute walk to India Gate.,1
55, However no one wrote that everyone else would have the same idea and we'd be standing in a queue for an hour to get in after rushing to get our tickets at 5:45am!,1
56,"The airlines person informed that we can carry the Asti,",1
57," one should be prepared to dedicate a whole day for travel alone as transit at Delhi could be issue and it happened so as it was not a transit ticket,",1
58,Our stay was fixed at Kumarasamy Mutt - http://www.,1

71," so we could wait 15 hours to get the next flight for about two and half hours to Yangon,",1
72,I was really impressed that the locals have managed to set it up with guides etc.,1
73,Towards the end of the tour the guide starts to tell us about his uncle’s shop and family business of carving ornaments out of rock.,1
74, In any place near a tourist area in India there'll be some “cheating men” as the hotel owners call them.,0
75," They'll stand on the street and follow you into hotel and try getting commission for taking you there etc,",1
76, or say they can get you a cheap room and it'll be like double the price they've quoted when you get there.,1

94, and I had the Hotel Atithi Thali Vegetarian Plate.,1

120, Val and I decided we did not want to go in the temple and we would wait outside with Arcal one of he yoga teachers.,1
121, We got to the hotel and grabbed our yoga mats for a well deserved relaxing class and headed to the ashram.,1
122, We drank chai and chatted and ate some sprouts and headed back to hotel to pack up for our noon flight.,1
123, but the retreat was not well planned we ended up going after yoga on our own with the driver we had and spent about 10 minutes shopping while the drive back and forth to the hotel was about 45 minutes due to traffic.,1

130,"An uneventful flight to Delhi took us to a boring Ibis hotel for the night,",1
131, as a result of Peters careful management of bank cards.,1
132, You may think it must be the Dehli belly but it skipped me there and waited til we're in the colourful town of Varanasi.,1
133,Once we finally got to our hotel we crashed out for a 12 hour sleep only to wake up with a man entering our room!,1
134,took Rob to an ATM to get money out in exchange for a refund on my card that I really started to freak out.,0

163," Many temples were destroyed when the Mughais invaded (and ruled much of India until the British),",0
164, Annoyingly there is a massive queue for the foreigners who have paid 750 rupees and none for the Indians who have paid 25 rupees.,1
165,"We return eventually to the hotel for a rest and then off to the Red Fort,",1
166,"The Red Fort was for many centuries the capital of first the Lodhi sultans who ruled India before being defeated by the first Mughal Emperor Babur in 1526,",1
167, We weren’t close enough to fully appreciate their height but they did look majestic.,1
168, with shops and homes.,1
169,We arrived in Agra on the evening of the 15th and checked into another amazing hotel before heading out for our first glimpse of the Taj Mahal.,1
170,was built by the Mughals who ruled a northern India from the early 16th century until the consolidation by the British colonial rule in the early 1800s.,0
171, This is a coffee shop that is run by women who have been victims of acid attacks.,1

179, Had a side lower berth in the AC2 class.,1
180,Left on time but onky had about half an hour before it got dark and couldn't se any more so resorted to playing games on the tablet and bought water and crisps from the train vendors.,1

182, staying at Sheraton 4 Points in Agra and after third room got it lucky.,0
183,damp and peeling walls in two rooms and they smelt musty and water damaged.,0

187, Back to hotel for breaky and hydrate and off out again to the Red Fort.,1
188, back to Delhi tomorrow for a shopping tour in the arvo - mainly to the Spice Market - then home Wednesday.,1
189,We'd planned a bit of luxury for Agra having found a very good deal at a new Marriott - not the kind of place we would normally choose to stay but it was less than the price of a very ordinary B & B in the Dales and we thought that we might benefit from a bit of pampering.,1
190,"30am so expected to have to wait to check in but the room was already available so we indulged ourselves for a few hours with proper coffee,",1
191,But we couldn't just sit in the hotel so after lunch we walked out to the main road to pick up a tuk-tuk rather getting them to call us a car (we're probably the only people staying there who didn't go everywhere by car and we were certainly the only people staying there with backpacks that we saw!,1
192, more indulgence with dinner back at the hotel but back in the room we could hear the music from the party downstairs really loudly.,1
193,a name for ourselves as one of the waiting staff apologised for the noise and hoped we'd managed to sleep when it finished.,1
194, I asked him if there were any more parties in the hotel for the next couple of nights and he said that there weren't so it should be quiet - phew!,1
195, He wanted to take us to the East gate which was closer but we had got the impression it was quite busy with groups from the big hotels so we made him take us to the South gate.,0
196, More veggie curry then back to the hotel for coffee and cake - yum!,1
197, They were very apologetic and said that we shouldn't pay anything for the tour and could they arrange for us to be taken to some sports shops the following day to try to replace the shoes.,1
198," I explained that we would need an outdoor clothing shop and they agreed that there probably wasn't somewhere in Agra,",1
199, particularly with large enough shoes.,0
200, We were heading back to Delhi in a couple of days so said that we would try there - H had enough with him to manage.,0
201,hotel and H had to walk through reception in his socks.,0
202,It was then that things really started to go wrong at the hotel as a cold shower was followed by an engineer coming and going from our room and leaving the tap and shower running on full.,1
203, we turned all the taps off again when we couldn't wait any longer for dinner and told them at reception again.,1
204, We also asked about the music that we could already hear playing in our room because we had been told that there weren't any parties that night.,1
205, Getting very frustrated with people not telling me the truth I asked to speak to the manager on duty who eventually turned up an hour or so later just as we finished dinner.,1
206, He tried to explain the conflict between guests staying in the hotel and party guests but he didn't seem to agree that it was not appropriate to hold loud parties that could be heard in guest rooms.,1
207, he was concerned that they couldn't be certain when we would have hot water so he offered us a different room at the side of the building furthest away from the music.,1
208, He travelled to the area to see a Sufi sage who lived in a cave to get some advice because he had not managed to have a child with any of his wives.,1
209, His Hindu wife gave him a son and he stayed and built the fort and mosque.,1
210,He then rushed us around the mosque but we stood our ground and went where we wanted to take pictures before finally leaving to catch the bus and then our taxi back to Agra for a final night in luxury.,1
211, I fitted in a complimentary massage as offered by the manager the night before.,1

238,"We then went back to the hotel to have breakfast,",1
239, pack up and then move to our next hotel the Meradan Grand Hotel.,1
240, the highlight of our trip so far was this particular night when we were literally dragged into a wedding reception at our hotel by the bride's father.,1

300, masses of people sat waiting for a train.,1
301, With so many trains coming and going we questioned whether they were waiting for the same train.,0

306, together with a French guy who was also staying at the guesthouse.,1
307, it was easy to take pictures without having to wait too long for your turn to pose in front of the building.,1
308, from where they ruled the country.,0
309, I told one of them that they always try to charge double the price and that’s why I dislike them.,0
310, I decided to tell him where I was staying and asked how much it would cost.,0
311, First I went outside on the main street to get some food and I had to go to the ATM as well.,1
312, women are not allowed near the cremation sites.,0
313, watching a bit of cricket (they allowed me to bowl a couple of times too).,1

316, they told me that I was on the waiting list (I completely forgot that) and that I couldn’t board the train.,1
317," I carried all my things to this waiting room and asked this friendly-looking couple and their baby,",1

326,"The other issue we faced yesterday was discovering that two bottles of mineral water we bought were probably refilled,",1
327, But we were lucky enough to make a small boat ride on the Yamuna river when Taj was closed (meaning: no tourists).,1

329," hospital stays in Chennai),",1
330,"I'd said to Molly Brown this morning that the room sharing wasn't really working too well,",1
331, but I stand by my thinking that I had on day 1 (even more so now) that she is a deliberate pain in the ass in order to end up with a room to herself without the extra cost.,1
332," We waited whilst some people went to use the loo,",1
333, Halfway into the journey we stopped for lunch at a place called Sushams Haveli hotel and restaurant.,0
334,We handed our passports to the Indian office for stamping and was told to wait outside.,1
335,We reached the hotel which was a welcoming sight for most.,1
336, There was even a gym and swimming pool but unfortunately both were closed for the night.,1
337,"We were allocated our rooms and Molly Brown had made no reference to our conversation this morning so seeing as we'd be sharing again,",1
338,Chris the guy from Belgium kindly offered the spare bed in his room should the snoring get too much.,1

351," Even one Indian told me that I am a """"problem"""" and should stay in a room (and that he can offer a room for 500 Rb.",0
352, But my friend has to drop off the tuktuk at a Delhi Bus station because we went to Jaipur and I had to go to the accomodation by my own in that tuktuk (after 9pm).,1
353, only Indians were allowed to stay and they gave us the address of the hotel.,1
354, Turns out that a full afternoon of snoozing for Molly brown wasn't enough and she snored the whole night.,1
355," Just as I was managing to drift off she'd start again,",0

371,We got a tuk tuk back to the hotel where I was looking forward to having an afternoon snooze.,1
372," I really wanted to stay in bed but thought I should eat as we were having such a long day tomorrow,",1

375,room to share the booze.,1
376," We stopped at a little shop on the way and I was in dispair when the driver did what looked to be a U turn,",0
377, chose to reverse that part instead to pull up outside of the shop-all with oncoming traffic beeping us out of the way.,0
378,"At the station we piled into the waiting room for an hour or so,",0
379, other wise it would have meant a long stay in that waiting room.,0
380," I thought of Daryls pep talks in the changing room where he'd make everyone close their eyes and visualise the game,",1
381," This made it easier in a way,",1
382, it seemed easier to look at that person I'd left back home.,0
383, as I'd have had to wait a bit longer for something else to remind me of the next new and exciting chapter of my life that would be beginning in a matter of weeks.,0
384,I made my way back to my bunk and thought enough was enough.,0
385, We walked across the road to the hotel which wasn't too far.,1

387," Raghu handed out the room keys,",1
388, Raghu did say that I could have my own room for the rest of the trip for an extra £200 for the week.,1
389,I headed down stairs to get something to eat from the hotel restaurant.,1
390, Again it was such a contrasting place-there were people like this and round the corner we'd just driven past a Tommy hillfiger shop advertising the latest fashion.,1
391, They leave all their worldly goods to their children or family and head to Varanasi to wait for God (I don't know which one as the Hindus have so many) we then turned around and headed towards the Ghats where the cremations took place.,1
392, There was a whispering wall where you stood in certain places and talked and the person at the other side of the room could hear you-so clever.,1
393, but we weren't allowed into that part for obvious reasons.,0
394, It was in a really good location with shops and money exchanges across the road so I went to get some more rupees.,1
395, We did manage to get plenty and had a decent amount of time to look around.,1
396," You weren't allowed to take photos or talk in this part,",0
397, but not before stopping by a tat shop to buy a mini model of the Taj Mahal to sit on my bookshelf once home.,1
398," didn't know the purpose of the red light (although the test rules have been said to be stricter nowadays,",1
399,at the hotel I showered and noticed the extractor fan wire handing just above the shower head (great Indian health and safety) so rinsed quickly and hopped into bed.,1
400,A couple of disappointments firstly after travelling all the way to Similpal national park I discovered on arrival that foreigners now need a special permit that would take four days to arrange anx I cant sit around on my arse that long.,1
401, I then attempted to visit the World Heritage listed Mahabohdi Temple but I couldnt get as mobile phones are not allowed since the complex was bombed by islamic terrorists a few years ago.,1
402, and not everyone is prepared to leave their comfort zone to experience it.,1
403," we made sure to hire a reputable guide who not only made sure we were safely escorted,",1
404, and provide us with all the information we'd need to understand the culture.,1

406, We also passed a room with weaponry that they used to use back when the palace was being guarded.,1
407,""""" The one thing our guide was able to tell us about this place was that the many beautiful windows of the Hawa Majal weren't only used for decoration but that they also had some sort of screen on them that allowed cool breeze to come in and that permitted the ladies to look through to view the proceedings of the people down below.",1
408,shopping was extremely fun for us.,1
409," We tried on and shopped for the traditional Indian Saris,",1
410," and I shopped at this textile store and got many things like the saris,",1
411, It was so much fun browsing and shopping for things that Indian's typically wear and have in their home.,1
412,"We stayed at a really nice hotel called the Taj Vilas (3 Star),",1

418," And nor were the Hotel Deepwoods,",0
419," but when the young guy from the hotel saw me; trying to eat with 5 layers of clothes,",0
420, and within minutes two fan heaters with a combined output of my travel hairdryer (yes I really do have one) arrived!,0
421, That's a darn cheap date night in my opinion.,1
422," Most of you know me well enough to identify this as one of my favourite triple malts,",1
423, which has to be easier than the 448 km train journey from Amritsar to Delhi at 5am this morning.,0
424," but not quite so luxurious as the last train,",0
425,)) The poor cab driver from the hotel was still waiting patiently when we finally arrived.,1
426,We didnt make full use of our stay in Agra or of the hotel (which is the most expensive one I booked in India) facilities due to our colds.,1
427," didnt use the hotel pool,",1

429," We are very very lucky to be wealthy westerners able to travel in the comfort of a first class lockable sleeping cabin for 2,",1
430, (but by international standards this luxury comes cheap at £300 for a months 1st class unlimited travel including sleepers).,1
431, At every level crossing there were crowds of people on bicycles waiting for the train to pass.,1
432,We took a motor rickshaw cab from the station to our guesthouse after breakfast.,1
433," Another thrilling cab ride weaving between cattle,",1
434, We are so lucky that we can slink back to the quiet of our room or the rooftop restuarant.,1
435, as we needed to leave the hotel by 5am to catch our 6am train.,1
436," We managed to shower,",1
437,We jumped into a taxi and made our way through the city’s thick morning fog to New Delhi station.,1
438, walked along the busy platform and waited for our train.,0
439, We finished the meal with a lassi (frothy yogurt and milk drink) and headed to Hotel Taj Resorts.,1
440,"rooms were ready,",1
441, We managed to get a few iconic photos as we entered the main gate before the ruthless camera touts bullied us (and everyone else) out of the way to make room for tourists who had paid to have iconic photos taken of themselves.,1
442, so we organised a taxi to get there.,1
443, so we jumped into our taxi and headed back to the hotel around 9pm.,1
444, The taxi driver ran straight over it without even attempting to brake.,0
445," I couldn't tell if they were camping overnight while waiting for trains,",1
446,We were in Chair AC class.,1
447," The train was possibly the most comfortable we’ve been on so far,",1
448, and he managed to convey the details of life in the fort in a way that really brought it all to life.,1
449, The walkway we used was inclined and angled at 90 degrees so charging war elephants couldn’t get a run up before they hit the doors.,0
450,"During the rule of Akbar’s grandson Shah Jahan (who built the Taj Mahal),",1
451," We saw the beautifully decorated rooms where Shah Jahan had spent his last days,",1

455, which was one of the few hotels we've stayed at that was grander on the inside than outside.,1
456," It was a super clean hotel and the room was smallish but very,",1
457," Hot water systems (and their availability) have been hit and miss in most of the Indian hotels we've stayed in,",1
458, because we had our first rainy day and the temperature struggled to stay in the double digits.,0
459, the view of the Taj Mahal from the hotel rooftop wasn’t a selling point.,1
460, He wanted the Taj Mahal to be constructed completely of marble but due to weight issues it had to be made from brick and clad in the stunning white marble which came from Varanasi.,1
461, and it was late afternoon when we finally arrived at the gates by electric shuttle bus (petrol/diesel vehicles are not allowed within the vicinity of the Taj Mahal).,1
462," There was a gender segregated queue for security,",1
463, there was still plenty of whistle blowing and yelling to try and keep queues orderly and the weird entrance systems flowing smoothly.,1
464, very expensive buildings that are built as show pieces with no functional purpose.,1
465, Peter and I caught a taxi there and settled in for what was probably the best meal of this trip so far.,1
466," On the taxi ride home,",1
467,Next we head west into Rajasthan to stay in the converted Madhogarh Fort.,1
468,To start we ate at the hotel and I was feeling much better (thanks to a couple little pills to help stop things).,1
469,There were so many different rooms throughout the Fort that were used for many different funations.,1
470, There were the receiving rooms where the king would receive the visiting dignitaries or his people.,1
471, Very comfortable and easy to get around and experience the grounds and feelings of the area.,1
472, We left our hotel around 8:30 or so and began our 8 hour bus journey to Agra.,1
473,"Along the way we stopped at a large hotel out in the middle of nowhere,",1
474, The hotel was amazing.,1

495,The cab was Chevrolet enjoy and it was new.,1
496,We left hotel for Fatehpur Sikri at around 10:30 AM morning.,1

516, The room is made of bare concrete and has little more than a bed inside.,1
517, for nearly 100 hours over ten days was a sarcastic response by the universe to E's and my desire to stay in one place for a while after spending the previous 11 days almost constantly moving.,0
518, An uncomfortable bed did not make the night's sleep any easier either.,1
519," Being in the same room as E but having to ignore her felt weird,",0

532," A steady stream of dead bodies being carried down the passageway outside the shop on bamboo stretchers wrapped in bright cloth just emphasised where we were,",1
533,We had a very acceptable double room with ensuite for 1000 rupees a night.,1
534,) They gave me a spare room to lie down in and boiled water for me to sup before we had to leave to catch the train to Delhi.,1
535, We look forward to staying in other Zostels on our trip.,1
536, The auto driver in Jhansi followed us for 25 to 30 minutes as we searched for a place to stay in town.,1
537, Eventually we found Hotel Shrinath Inn and got a room whilst he continued parked up outside for us for who knows long?,1
538, It included accomodation for one night in Agra but other than that little more than train tickets for a total of £98 per person.,1
539,The round trip has also resulted in spending more money on accomodation than we'd have preferred to.,1
540, That's entirrely don to our naive belief that we could turn up in a town and find somewhere fairly cheap to sleep at the drop of a hat.,1
541," Our room in Jhansi was pretty ramshackle and involved an awkward 30 seconds with a bell boy - that hadn't actually done anything - closing our room door very slowly whilst we didn't give him a tip,",1
542, and our first night in Lucknow resulted in spending nine hours in a room that could almost certainly only have been used for illicit sexual pleasure.,1
543, Most of the hotels were booked up so we after over an hour of searching accepted an 800 rupee bedroom at Hotel Diamond that wasn't even on their room listing.,1
544, we finally got a rickshaw to drop us at the Ganges and it wasn’t long before we had searched and found a room at Hotel Ganges View just south of Assi Ghat on the Ganges River.,1
545,Slightly above our budget (as we were in need of some pampering) we paid up the room for 6 nights for 9000 rupees and decided to sit tight with a little view for my birthday week.,1
546, After a few beeping horns and a great cheeky Chai I decided to head back to the room to take advantage of our satellite TV and comfy bed.,1
547, On our stroll from the south you begin by passing small lanes filled with dust that is created from the traffic and dried out cow dung that I have to say doesn’t make most of the streets in Varanasi comfortable to walk around.,1

596, but Emily and I managed to catch a few great photos just over a few minutes whilst it burst through a break in the clouds.,1
597," some people went back to the hotel; Tom,",1
598, that is so much easier with eight people than with 16!,0
599,"The train managed to arrive with only an hour and a half delay,",0
600, I did manage to get that.,1
601,Ankur put a smile on everyone's face this morning when he informed us that we are going to Agra.,1
602,We went back to our rooms for a bit of a rest as we had a couple of hours to kill before meeting back as a group.,1
603," Jude set the alarm to allow for a nap,",1
604,imam reliably informed by our guide Dushyant.,1
605, but we were not allowed to take any photos.,0
606, and also groups of people waiting on the steps with bound and covered bodies adorned with flowers waiting for them to be cremated.,1
607,Then we headed back to the hotel where I managed to catchup on some of my lost sleep from the crazy night train.,1
608, Mary and Steph waited until we hit the shore liNd and then paddled in.,1
609, We were not allowed to take photos of the cremation sire but we could take them from a distance.,0
610, let you take photos and then charge you thousands of rupees not to say anything.,0
611, Then a tuk tuk home to the hotel We got stuck in traffic and found ourselves being followed by a man who had taken a shine to Mary and was walking with his dick out in his hand.,1
612,"She and her husband have worked hard to move from living in a one bedroom place at the back of a shop to a lovely little new build home with separate bedrooms,",1
613,We arrived in plenty of time to catch the train so waited in the ladies only waiting room.,1
614," So eventually our guide asked the waiting room attendant to ask her to ove,",1
615, She tried to get it but couldn't so her husband tried but was holding all the passengers up waiting to get on.,1
616," We did have AC and a fan,",1
617,The AC was on full so it was cold but we didn't know how to get a blanket.,1
618, but sadly no that luxury was to be taken away from me.,0
619,Finally we were pulling into Varanasi we had to wait 45 mins in the heat with no AC and only a ceiling fan to keep us cool.,1
620, As usual we had to dodge to maic traffic and avoid an early death on the roads lol but we managed it and all arrived at the air conditioned hotel all in one piece.,0
621,We headed to our rooms for a quick shower and then meet for lunch in the restaurant.,1
622, In most hotel rooms on this trip we have had to insert the key fob in to a slot behind the door to activate the leccy and AC.,1
623, We were then advised we had not pushed the key fob in the right way or far enough so in fact all was ok with the leccy and it was also user error on the tap front too!,1
624,When we got back to the hotel guess what .,0
625, just the reception so the lobby was packed with guests and the sound of the party voices and music was coming up from the room the reception was being held in.,1
626, well as you can guess by lack of updates I have been having wifi issues.,1
627, This time it's intermittently on and off and I have to sit in a fan cooled room but it's still very warm.,1
628," We are staying in the same hotel,",1
629,10am we left the hotel and drove the short distance to the car park.,1
630, Ladies in one queue and gents in another.,0
631,After watching the kids playing and swimming etc we wandered further into the complex and climbed some stairs to a pool where people were swimming and kids playing.,1
632,Sorry I haven't blogged for the last couple of days but we had no internet access last night and the last evening in Jaipur my pay wifi ran out before I had time to do an update.,0
633, My internet time ran out in Jaipur before i could update my.,0
634, Yesterday we're were in Tordi Garh and the hotel had no wifi!,1
635, ventilation systems and lots of secret passages to allow the royal family to escape and cause confusion should the palace be invaded.,1
636, When this was happening no women were allowed in the vicinity.,0
637, Also they created a ventilation system which allowed air and light in but did not allow you tossed in or out of corridors and rooms.,1
638,had separate apartments and rooms and we're not allowed to talk to each other unless the marharjine gave them permission.,1
639,When they had children they here only allowed tomstaynwithntheir mothers until they were 5years old and were then moved to a separate area of the palace to be educated.,0
640,We then head lunch and head back to the hotel for a few hours r and r.,0
641," We are staying in a small family run hotel which is basic but clean and comfortable,",1
642, and has air conditioning in the rooms- bonus!,1
643, Once settled in our rooms we had some home cooked lunch and afterwards a few hours R and R.,1
644,We arrived in Jodhpur just after lunch and after checking in we sat in the hotel garden and had some lunch.,1
645, We had a nice meal and then went back to the hotel for guess what.,1
646, came back to our hotel to join in the festivities.,1
647," We went down to the hotel restaurant but the only breakfast was buffet,",0
648, Then we tried about 3 hotel restaurants down the road but all had their restaurant on the 5th floor which was too much to deal with at that point in time!,0
649, So we admitted defeat and went back to our hotel and had toast and chocolate milkshake!,1
650,After breakfast we went back to the room and lazed around until 12.,0
651, Miriam and myself went into the palace and spent a good few hours wandering around the beautifully decorated rooms and gardens.,1
652, which was about 40 minute drive from our hotel in Pushkar.,1
653,After dinner we walked back to the hotel and hit bed early as we had sunrise hike in the morning.,1
654, Myself and Krissy (who hadn't been very well) stopped just shy of the top and got comfortable on our personal rock seat.,1
655,After breakfast we went back to the hotel and went back to bed!,1
656," Slept until 3pm when we got up and all took a taxi into town,",1
657, stopping off at various shops on the way back.,0
658,We had dinner in the hotel restaurant and then had another party on the rooftop!,1
659, Today we had the luxury of a private air conditioned car and a departure time of 9.,1
660,Afterwards we went to a block printing shop and watched a demonstration of block printing prior to some retail therapy in the shop.,1
661,After lunch we went back to the hotel to get out of the heat for a few hours.,1
662, Purchases in hand we left and headed back to the hotel in a tuktuk for dinner and group briefing with Ankur.,1
663,We then went to a rooftop restaurant for dinner and back to the hotel for bed as early start for sunrise at the Taj.,1
664, Ashok took us to a great local and cheap eatery for lunch.,1
665, From here we got to our hotel for the night and Ashok dropped us off just outside the Jaipur walls so we could see the Jantar Mantar observatory and city palace.,1
666, which also has three sacred pools of water.,1
667, One of the pools has been taken over by thousands of monkeys that congregate there to swim and bathe.,1
668, The legend says that the three sacred pools are varying depths said to be two or three elephants high deep.,1
669, The hotel was very cheap and I think had India's dirtiest bath/bathroom for sure.,1
670, we had one guide (they thought we would need two) and one bike each (they wanted us to hire a rickshaw as well) we were off.,1
671, we still saw a decent amount and the guide kept us entertained pointing out different birds and telling us about a book he has coming out with the national geographic.,1
672, and internet for that matter!,1
673," it is the part when there is a taxi tour and the young boy is 'looking after' the car,",1
674,"bit of a mix up with us not being allowed to take a tripod in,",0
675,"We enjoyed the taxi trip a lot,",1
676," comfortable way to see Rajasthan,",1
677," We decided to ease our way in we would pre-arrange a taxi pickup with our hostel,",1
678, which was great as we didn't have to deal with hundreds of taxi drivers all wanting our fare.,1
679, although we did make a couple of pit stops - one to pick up the local chewing leaf (paan) from what seemed like his mates shop and then to swop drivers.,1
680, the stairways and landings looking quite old and run down but the room being ultra modern!,1
681, which the queue for was huge; there were hundreds of families all holding gifts to take into the temple.,1
682, and there are cremation ghats where bodies are cremated waterside allowing ashes to be washed away by the rivers.,1
683," Its best to be as ‘casual’ as possible and take a seat enough away from the action so you aren’t intruding but close enough you can see and take in the unique experience in a respectful way,",0
684," He took us up to a room on the 2nd floor of a derelict building over looking the Ghat,",1
685, are these bodies waiting to be burnt?,0
686," Lots of lots of people hire boats to go watch and also children (with fantastic English language·) sell you candles,",1
687, This turned into a huge scene with one of her friends jumping in to save her and she almost drowned him as well when finally a man in a fishing boat stuck his paddle out for her to hold onto and managed to drag her and her friends onto the boat!,1
688,As it was our first over night train journey we again eased our way in and went on AC first class.,1
689,"So we are staying put in our hotel,",1
690," For the past 3 or 4 years Singhji is no longer allowed to guide his tours through the Taj Mahal,",0
691," I was disappointed at the inside,",0
692,"We woke up bright and early the day after my birthday and decided it wasn’t worth moving rooms again - we had originally told Shiva we were moving to Jill and Richards when they left as it was slightly nice and had an aircon,",1
693,We had a nice brunch at OM then headed back to the hotel to get organized for a walking tour we had arranged with Varanasi Walks.,1
694, I tried to keep my balance as he pushed me until I saw a cow charging past me and into Taylor!,1
695, We were told to leave our shoes in a small alleyway at a little shop and to walk a short distance to the temple.,1
696, We were a little disappointed as it wasn't as good as previous ones we had eaten and we had really talked it up to Brandon who wasn't impressed with it at all!,1
697, We didn't have much planned for the day so we decided to just wander the back streets and do some shopping for scarves.,1
698,We found our way to Ba Ba Black Sheep - a silk and pashmina scarf shop recommended for its quality.,1
699, I then went back to the hotel and ate Nutella for dinner!,1
700," We curled up on the newspaper and waited for our train to arrive… Not long before the train turned up a lone cow meandered past slowly on our platform,",1
701, we had breakfast while we waited to check in.,1
702,"I told them to please wait and I bolted for the toilets,",1
703,"We made our way to find a taxi and met up with an Aussie couple,",0
704, Richard and Jill who just happened to be staying at the same guesthouse .,0
705, We shared a taxi with them to the guesthouse.,1
706,The taxi dropped us off at the main road and a guy met the taxi to then show us how to get to our guesthouse.,1
707, he seemed a little uneasy (given he had just given someone our room we booked) and so showed us to another room which was not what I had paid for.,1
708, I was extremely rude to him about it and was told that it was the only room but we could either A) swap with Jill and Richard or B) move the next day.,1
709, especially when I saw their room a little while later and it was extremely cute and just what I wanted!,1
710,I went downstairs to the room and started crying.,1
711, I cried myself to sleep and Taylor was kind enough to tuck me in when she came to bed later on.,1
712, and walked up to the rooftop to have a Chai and wait for her to rise.,1
713, We spoke to Shiva about changing rooms and he showed us a room similar to Jill and Richards.,1
714, We were staying at Munshi Ghat.,0
715, catching up on internet and chatting.,1
716, We went back to the room to chill out and eat nutella from the jar.,1
717, We were a little disappointed since we were there to have dinner and socialise.,0
718, as well as in CD shops playing Indian music.,1
719, I can tell you that it was not a disappointment indeed!,1
720, we managed to see a boa constrictor.,1
721, the city that was the Mughal capital for a decent amount of time back in the day.,1
722," Shah Jahan Function: Monument,",1
723, When I arrived in New Delhi I was meeting a friend and he still had not arrived yet so I waited in the baggage area for a while before deciding to go get a room at the Airport Lounge.,0
724," not allowed to stay in Delhi,",0
725, nor were we allowed to leave the airport because the fog was so heavy it was unsafe to drive.,0
726, it was safer to stay at the airport then try to get the driver to take us to Agra in the morning.,0
727,) It is more like a fort/castle thing with amazing gardens and pools and beauty everywhere.,1
728," but my friend and I REALLY wanted to see it one night so we were sneaking all over this hotel trying to find different ways up to the tower,",1
729, got off topic with the hotel thing there.,1
730,power in ruling the empire.,1
731, When it was my turn I was not brave enough to hold the snake so I got as close as I felt I could then smiled to the camera.,1
732, (we stopped at a carpet shop and saw how they were made.,1
733, That young girl had enough respect for me/herself/morals/karma to forget how hungry and cold she was and not take my stuff.,1
734," but I think the cultural differences of the Cast system or work related issues made it very uncomfortable for him,",1
735," I wasn't really prepared for when people said that part of your heart stays in India,",1
736,"Our hotel for the night was very swanky,",1
737, it really is such a contrast from the chaos outside to the serenity inside and of course the luxury and comfort inside to the poverty and sadness in the street.,1
738," being made in Jaipur were coming to the hotel tonight,",1
739, only 1 hour to wait for the gates to be opened.,0
740,Back to the hotel for a late breakfast and then straight off to visit Agra Fort - there is going to be no rest on this holiday but we don't mind when we are seeing all these amazing sights.,1
741, She was to be my next door neighbour at the new hotel I'd checked into: Hotel Sheela.,1
742, who rocked up out of nowhere and asked for a room (Thanks to a Lonely Planet recommendation mind you).,1
743, (Also interesting was that due to her religious beliefs she wasn't allowed to willingly make any physical contact with a man.,1
744," We were lucky enough to be the first people to get to the Taj,",0
745," They told me I had to wait half an hour for the booking,",0
746, which was enough time for the driver to take me to a shop!,0
747, I made it easier by announcing on arrival that I wouldn't buy anything.,0
748, We were in luck - all the celebrating would culminate in a procession that would be passing right next to our Hotel as they head down to the river to submerge effigies of the Goddess Durga into it.,1
749, and made it back to the hotel with everything intact.,1
750, This was a strong awakening to the standard of living and amount of poverty that was waiting us for the next 10 days.,1
751, our accomodation for the night.,1
752, with vast silk shops and colour and spice filling every section it was amazing!,1
753," the elephants allowed us to get up close to a pair of mother and calf Rhino's,",1
754," and wait until the next morning,",1
755, This left us to hang out in our surprisingly cheap but very nice hotel about 1km away from the Taj Mahal’s East Gate.,1
756, except these guys were a touch more persistent and literally tagged along with us from the moment we left the hotel to the second we arrived at the restaurant we decided to eat in.,0
757," far from having had enough of the mighty Taj Mahal,",1
758," and the fact that we would have rickshaw drivers hassling us and shop sellers dragging us into places wasn’t really anything new to us,",0
759, fairly quiet and the room was half decent albeit a little dark.,0
760, the resident hotel tour operator sat us straight down and kindly showed us a few things on the map.,1
761," We have been here long enough to know that this is code for ‘I’m gonna try sell you a tour before you step outside and get one cheaper’,",1
762, however the guy was friendly enough and we wanted to see what was on offer.,1
763," he quoted us what seemed a decent price,",1
764," we had decent seats,",1
765," however it was enough to put us out of action for a good 24 hours,",1
766," It really was an interesting and informative couple of hours finding out who did what,",1
767, fake ones loved it and charge you for the honour!,0
768, He used to have a shop in the market but for 10 years had not been able to face it.,0
769, and allowing thoughts to come and go without them taking over ones state of being.,1
770, The way he again let me be and felt comfortable to go and do that made me feel very accepted.,1
771, One important reason why its a good time is that internet connections actually work pretty well before 10am after which office India goes on-line.,1
772, although there are chai shops if I fancied an early stroll and chai.,1
773, But I stay in my room and waste an hour answering emails and working on blogs.,1
774, Now which of my favourite chai shops will I patronise this morning?,1
775, I have this mythological belief that its important to my chai shop 'friends' that I maintain patronage – what is that?,1
776,I suspect this baba is quite wealthy - he is always dressed immaculately and it seems obvious he has a decent place to live.,1
777, He runs a toilet-size shop selling this and that in his 'spare' time.,1
778, On the way through there is a sweet shop run by Vishnu who I met in 2010.,1
779, I visit Satish in his chai shop in the middle of the fruit and vegetable market which is right on the route taken by the funeral marches to the burning ghat.,1
780, The steps at the left of the picture (also submerged) is where Rama Guru ran his chai shop for at least the last 33 years (when I first met him).,1
781,On the way back to my room it starts to rain – heavily – but its just a 10 minute shower.,1
782,My room is the door in the middle of the pic!,1
783," Making my way back to my room after lunch,",1
784, one motor boat and manages one houseboat.,1
785, Its a joyous reunification and I am quickly feeling at home as I ditch my pants and shirt and apply my gumpcha as a lungi and sit comfortably in the Ganga breeze.,1
786, I am invited to stay for freshly netted fish which have drifted down from the mountains.,1
787, I buy a small sweet lassi and 100 grams of dahi (curd) from Shyam's shop at Assi Ghat.,1
788,Only small problem is that there is a wedding the next day next to my Guest House – friends of Deepak and Rajana – so they are availing the area right outside my room to the preparation of sweetmeats for the event – a rather noising undertaking which keeps me awake until 12.,1
789," Our hotel (Hotel Kamal,",1
790, and we could actually see it from our hotel roof.,1
791, Warning: you go through metal detectors and they don’t allow food or drinks other than water inside.,1
792, So order a thali to split and save room for dessert!,1
793, we also got a cheap cell phone.,1
794," an address (a hotel address is fine),",1
795, You can ask at your hotel for a recommended cell phone dealer.,1
796,We had another of my favorite experiences in India while eating breakfast on the hotel roof in view of the Taj Mahal.,1
797," One of the neighbors of the hotel happened to be on his roof with his daughter,",1
798," in the AC-3 compartment,",1
799," AC-3 means you have a bed to yourself,",1
800," wait for us,",1
801, All while I sit inside a modern air conditioned show room eyeing off the new bikes on display.,1
802,Riding into Ranchi (and its gotten dark now) I wonder about where I am going to find a decent place to stay.,0
803, there is the 'Midtown Hotel' staring at me.,1
804, the guy in the front shop assures me I am at the right place (its almost as if he were expecting me) and ushers me down the lane to the Reception.,1
805," arrange with said young Sikh to gain free access to a large A/C deluxe room in the morning so that I can do my hatha yoga,",1
806, and they will tell you: Rule #1 when traveling to New Delhi: “Watch out for scams”.,1
807, He kindly informed us that the Grand Bazaar had been closed off due to religious conflicts (Hindu-Muslim) that had taken place during the Ramadan festival.,1
808, He told us that in order to get into the area we had to go to the Government tourist office and get a pass (which is free) that confirmed we were staying at a hotel along the Bazaar.,1
809, Sure enough we arrived at an office with an official looking “Government of India: Tourism” sign.,1
810, They called our hotel to figure out how this situation could be solved.,1
811, I was put on the phone with the ‘hotel owner’ and he told me that the hotel was closed for the night because on the conflicts occurring on the Grand Bazaar.,1
812, He said he would be reporting the hotel to the Government!,0
813," He said the ONLY hotel available in New Delhi was just outside of town and was 5,",0

816,"The next day when we arrived in Varanasi I received an email from our original hotel owner asking us why we never showed up,",0
817, He said he was going to charge us a night rent at his hotel.,1
818," that we had NOT spoken to the hotel owner (but instead the scammer’s associate),",1
819, Luckily the owner of our original hotel was very kind and did not charge us for the night we missed which helped stopped the bleeding a little bit.,1
820," all of that; our hour taxi drive from the Varanasi airport into the central town hit us with all of it,",1
821," as it is a big issue in India,",0
822," Sure enough there was his uncle and a couple business associates waiting for us with big smiles and samples of silk scarves,",1
823, Our room was big and clean with air conditioning!,1
824, the front desk manager decided to have the head chef make me a special breakfast anyway.,1
825,A driver came to bring me to another hotel where I would meet up with the other people from other hotels who would join the group.,1
826, At one point one of the tuk tuks (little cabs) clipped the back of our van.,1
827, just got clipped by a little cab and our driver stops the car and gets out.,0
828," that was another charge…it goes to show you there is no such things as a free lunch,",1

843, Khar wasn't/hasn't been allowed back into China since.,0
844, He will never be allowed back into China.,0
845, I also have health issues and the fact that I have a weight problem doesn't help at all.,0
846," the car is waiting for us at the Varanasi station,",1
847, We check in and I share the room with my folks on an extra bed.,1
848," The hotel is lovely,",1

852, we return to the hotel and it seems to me that I'm staying in a taj hotel after decades.,1
853," the taj property was an erstwhile palace now bought by the hotel after most of the maharajas converted their palaces to hotels post the abolition of the privy purse by Indira Gandhi,",1
854, we may have seen a couple of idols too and my father managed to have a cycle rickshaw run over his feet.,1
855, i nurse him back to recovery in the hotel and on one of our walks we strolled into an antique store and dad bought this amazing statue of a mother and a child.,1
856, so the story goes that cow herds were used to capture these houses and my grandfather had singlehandedly managed to renovate and maintain one house.,1
857, The lanes narrow enough to hold one bull standing on it are also something to add to your must-watch list in Varanasi.,1
858,"the very last moment my mum and me walked down to a shop behind the hotel and i find such exotic stuff,",0
859, Most of the shops were still closed but a number were starting to open and the guide bought Michelle a small string of pretty tiny flowers that smelled like jasmine.,1
860, We went up and down the Ganges with the guide explaining where different kings had built their homes or where celebrities like the Beatles stayed when they went through their Hari Krishna stage.,1
861," Michelle waited in one of the clean stores selling aryuvedic oils,",1
862, Our morning ended at yet another shop where we helped support the local economy.,1
863," The information may,",1
864, we felt brave enough to wander off the hotel grounds and explore the local environs.,1
865, Traffic is another issue completely.,0
866, Our experience in India’s luxury hotels has been wonderful.,1
867, a hotel employee was anxious to show us the mango trees growing on their property.,1
868,"small entourage of hotel staff including the maitre de,",1

873, just ‘hang around” waiting for the cremation to finish.,0

879, allowing us to view the Taj Mahal without rain pouring down.,1
880,Our day finished with some very expensive shopping at the government run shops for local craftsman making products specific to Agra.,1
881, Then we went to an embroidery shop were we view the stunning work again made by local craftsmen.,1
882," In each of the hotels we stayed there is quite a bit of security check of your bags,",1
883, So we spent sometime drying them in the hotel room.,0

1459," This I followed up with high tea at the Imperial Hotel where for about 800 rupees (about $16) you can tuck into all of the scones (complete with clotted cream),",1
1460, Up there we could see the line of dead bodies waiting to be cremated next to the Ganges.,0
1461, so we spent a chilled evening reflecting on our stay in India so far.,0
1462, Most are bathing ghats but there are a few cremation ghats and my hotel in Varanasi just happened to be right above one of them - Harishchandra Ghat - about 50 meters from the river bank.,1
1463, Behind the hotel is an enormous supply of wood which the relatives of the deceased must buy to have their loved one cremated here.,0
1464,I walked from my hotel past 20 or so ghats towards one of the main bathing ghats.,1
1465," The scene here was one some ways almost reminiscent of a sunny day in the summer at an English seaside resort - hundreds of people,",0
1466, The next day I also managed to find a stall recommended by the guidebook - The Blue Lassi - absolutely heavenly lassis flavoured with almost any available fruit.,1
1467, sheer number of people and the amount of people waiting to scam you all seem to conspire against you.,1
1468,The guidebook said 'give it a chance and this schizophrenic capital could capture your heart'.,0
1469, and maybe its just me that couldn't hack it (have not met a single traveller who liked it FYI)but I couldn't wait to get out of the place.,1
1470, transport used and even hotel rooms.,1
1471, and then at the end try to convince to go to some shop or tourism office they know.,0
1472, and also join in the game of trying to take you to a different hotel than you requested as yours is 'full'.,1
1473," or the hotel you booked is full or that the tourist office has moved,",1
1474," taxis and rickshaws who use the horn as though a conduit,",1
1475, There was some lovely architecture and easy to imagine this shah ruling over the people from his marble throne.,1
1476," they have left his room as it was that day showing his few worldly remains,",1
1477," My hotel in Pahargang called Cottage Yes Please (indian hotel names are amazing)was great and is also recommended to others,",1
1478, So overall New Delhi wasn't for me and the 3 days there were my limit and enough to see everything in my opinion.,1
1479," It is easy to stay longer than you planned and watch amazed at the sight before you,",1
1480," I love to people watch but the 2 days here nearly gave me enough memories to store for a lifetime,",1
1481, I'm not sure sitting in a cafe window and watching Cardiff people go by carrying their Tesco shopping or boutique handbags will ever be as interesting again.,1
1482," The area is full of heavily armed soldiers due to security issues and communal tensions,",1
1483, Thoroughly daunted already we (myself and an Aussie from hotel) went ahead.,1
1484," where pilgrims form a queue to make their offering of milk and flower by throwing it in a well,",1
1485," As we were with a hotel guide we were introduced to a priest who said he could get us in,",0
1486, it was only when back at the hotel I felt vaguely normal.,0
1487," Alka hotel is recommended for the amazing views from the balcony and decent price,",0
1488," but with enough filth to make you cross your legs,",0
1489, flowing fountains and water in front which allows you to see the Taj in perfect reflection and is also built on the bend of a serene river.,1
1490, To top it off I had a hotel which had a rooftop restaurant and it looked right at the Taj from nearby so I spent most of that evening gazing in wonder while drinking Indian beer and eating good food with people during the sunset.,1
1491," I have since found India a little easier to cope with since those first early mind frazzling days in Delhi,",0
1492, Outside the railway station there is a tourist office hotel booking agency so I went there first.,0
1493," It was useful that I did because when I mentioned that I wanted to stay near the station because I had to catch a train the next morning,",1
1494, he sorted out a hotel and a cycle rickshaw to take me there.,0
1495,After checking in at the hotel I just dumped my stuff and went straight back out and found a tuk tuk to take me to the Red Fort.,1
1496,"Back to my hotel then for a much needed shower,",0
1497, then spent an hour in an internet cafe before going to eat - had an excellent chicken curry in a really small local food shop (I couldn't really call it a restaurant!,1
1498, The train was also almost an hour late in leaving so I had a long wait on the platform where I had some breakfast (vegetable samosas!,0
1499," and there was a separate queue for foreigh tourists,",0
1500, I went outside and got a tuk tuk to one of the hotels recommended in the Lonely Planet India guide - The Shanti Lodge.,1
1501, This hotel has a rooftop restaurant with a superb view of the Taj Mahal.,1
1502," so this afternoon I just walked around all 3 sides of the Taj Mahal (it backs on to the river but you aren't allowed to walk along that side),",0
1503,On Tuesday morning I had breakfast on the roof garden of the hotel with the Taj Mahal in the background.,0
1504,A car picked us up from our hotel at 6am and we set off for Agra!,0
1505, taxi's - the lot!,0
1506, We had a few photos taken in front of it and suprisingly got to the front of a pretty small queue for the Diana seat and had a photo taken there - despite Graeme's reluctance to strike the Diana pose!,1
1507," The driver tried and tried to persuade us to """"take a look at my friend's shop until the rain stops"""",",1
1508, So after another long wait at the side of the road we were finally on our way.,0
1509, the children are never allowed to sit on the floor in schools.,0
1510, and stayed in a great motel once again with a pool ( No bats or monkeys!,0
1511," although I was sick for the majority of my stay here and it was extremely hot,",1
1512," We were picked up at the Delhi Airport and transported to """"The Connaught"""" hotel in New Delhi.",1
1513, who are not allowed to be burnt; 1.,0
1514, After the Holyman's informative chat he then hit us with how they need funds to run Hospice building where poor people come to die next to the holy ghat.,0
1515, He said that he hoped he could save enough money to buy them a shop!,0
1516," There are thousands and thousands of these tiny shops in the streets of Varanasi and that was his ambition for his children,",0
1517, At this point of time we deemed it necessary to take a little time off touring so on Kezia's advice we visited the Syria Hotel which had a pool that you could use and cool drinks.,1
1518, who went into the house while we bemused waited in the Jeep.,0
1519,) until we arrived at the hotel we were supposed to arrive at the following day!,0
1520," So after breakfast our immediate port of call was the hotel swimming pool,",0
1521,"restaurant (dragged out for a few hours as there was ac and a decent place to play cards in) having a meat platter,",1
1522, Then back to the pool and then back to the bar!,0
1523," The group booked through the hotel to go down,",1
1524, holy people and lepers were cast into the river rapped in shrouds as they were not allowed to be burnt.,0
1525,"through Agra to our hotel was not all that inspiring,",0
1526,"the road we managed to block it in both directions,",1
1527,especially after what we charge foreigners to see the sights of London.,1
1528, so i managed an auto in 200 rs to cover all major destination spots in agra.,1
1529, After putting my bagpack in the clock room and paying entry fee i entered.,1
1530, The train itself was not fancy or overly comfortable but we had a place to sit and a window to enjoy the views that passed by.,0
1531,As we sat waiting for our train to set of on the 3 1/2 hour journey to Agra we enjoyed watching the hustle and bustle of the train station from our safe quarters.,1
1532," Other than the room conditions,",0
1533," I plan on finding a good organization soon and making donations that way,",1
1534, with all the haze there wasn't much of a sunrise but at least it was still cool enough to enjoy our visit.,1
1535," A private car would be waiting for us at 2 pm to take us to our next destination,",1
1536, so we ran back to the shop and bought 10 more.,0
1537," pushing in queues and generally just causing unnecessary chaos,",1
1538, We decided to splash out on a $30 a night hotel and its like a palace.,0
1539," We have organised for the hotels tuk tuk driver,",1
1540, and charging you much more too.,0
1541,"The idea to book a hotel in Agra was a good one,",1
1542," The prepaid taxi driver from the train station to the hotel was all nice and charming,",1
1543, and you can hire this car for the whole day!,1
1544, the last time when we pulled off by the hotel with the Taj clearly in the view.,0
1545," you are informed that the ticket office is 1 km away,",0
1546, we walk there dodging rikshas and promising a teenage guy called Lucky to have a look at his shop after Taj.,1
1547," yes we will visit your shop we promise,",0
1548," I was stupid enough to have the swiss knife and a torch in my pocket,",1
1549, and these two are not allowed inside.,0
1550,---->These are not allowed inside.,0
1551,"The hotel I was staying in was filthy,",0
1552,Anyway if your thinking of staying here I would definately recommend against it.,0
1553, so no lights are really allowed in anyway.,0
1554, After this we managed to go back to sleep and have a bit of a lie in.,0
1555, We lugged our backpacks through the stinky alleys until we reached the car - which had managed to get down to the Ghats at this time of the day (no Pilgrms!,0
1556, We have included some photos of our 'hotel' with this blog.,0
1557, Mr Barun was waiting for us in the Arrival Hall at Delhi Airport.,0
1558, He drove us the half hour to our hotel wich was called The Residence and is located in South Delhi.,1
1559,The hotel is one of the best yet.,0
1560, The room was lovely.,0
1561," It has maintained its religious heritage since the 6th century BC in one continuous tradition,",1
1562," It is located on a ford on the river and is among the holiest of all tirthas ('crossing place'? These tirthas allow the devotee access to the divine,",1
1563,order to meet our guide for the day in the hotel reception.,0
1564, was waiting and immediately led us down the hotel steps to the river bank where there was a young boy waiting for us with a rowing boat.,1
1565, temples and palaces (of which our 'hotel' was one).,0
1566, Ajay informed us that they only send out one priest for the morning rituals (unlike the ceremony last night when there were quite a few).,0
1567," In reality the river is scummy with effluent (our hotel probably being one of the contributors - there is no sewage system),",0
1568, M looked a bit concerned and asked Ajay where the hotels did their laundry.,1
1569, and facilitating the final release for those lucky enough to pass away here.,0
1570, We were not allowed inside as you had to be a Hindu.,0
1571,Ajay arrived on time and we walked back through the alleys to the waiting car and driver.,1
1572, We returned to the hotel where over a Kingfisher D decided that Varinasi should have a new English name.,1
1573, There were four separate queues to get in.,1
1574, The men’s queue moved fairly swiftly but the women’s was painfully slow.,0
1575, The emperor was devastated by her death and wanted to create an unsurpassable monument to her memory and its name 'Taj Mahal' is simply an informal version of the title of the palace in which Mumtaz lived.,0
1576, The original structure would have been made of wood and scattered with luxurious carpets and the ceiling would have been covered with satin canopies.,1
1577, There is an identical building to the east which was only added to maintain the symmetry of the complex.,1
1578, We waited on the platform with our agent for the train.,0
1579, The journey to Bharatpur Station took us about two and half hours and we were met by the agent who was waiting outside our carriage.,0
1580, He took us to the waiting Mr Barun.,0
1581, who was to stay with us until we left Agra.,0
1582, It consists of 3 rooms and is also known as 'Blind Man's Buff House' as it is great for playing the ancient game.,0
1583,Next we went to the Anup Talao (Peerless Pool) which has a balustraded platform in the centre which is approached by 4 causeways.,1
1584, Sachin told us a little of the history of the building before we climbed aboard the tuk tuk and retuned to the car park and the waiting Mr Barun.,1
1585, We were not in a hotel this time but a homestay.,0
1586, This is where you stay in a room in someone's house.,0
1587," The room was clean,",0
1588, It was a bit of a rip off but was enough to curb our hunger.,1
1589, We stopped at a 'Wine Shop' and Mr Barun got us a couple of Kingfishers (he gets Indian prices of 70 rupees where we get charged 5 times that) to take back to the hotel.,0
1590,We will get a taxi to the railway station in a few hours and will arrive in Kolkata at 08.,0
1591, My ticket is confirmed but I do not have my Coach/Berth number so I go to the ticket office and the man goes on the railway internet site and gets my details for me.,1
1592,Now to wait for the train and wait I did.,0
1593, This afternoon Mirs wants some company to go shopping so a stroll of the town it is.,0
1594,About this time I managed to lock myself out of my room by snapping shut my padlock and leaving all the keys inside.,0
1595,I wait at the stop and try to find some shade as it is again a warm one.,1
1596,I sit next to a lad called Michael from Frankfurt and no sooner then we had said hello when in the seats in front are 2 of the volunteers from Holi in Jodhpur.,1
1597, We arrive have a look at the rooms which are ok and we are in.,0
1598,As I am going up to my room I meet at guy called Eggi also from Frankfurt who I was with for a short time in Bundi.,0
1599,Michaeland me decide to get up early and go to the Taj before the AC buses arrive.,1
1600,Up early to get to the Taj and join the queue for a ticket.,0
1601,It’s now late afternoon and I have to leave tonight for Varanasi so back to the hotel to eat and get my ruck which is locked away in Michael’s room.,1
1602, While looking up something later we found this was a common scam by tuk tuk drivers who then go on to charge you a lot for the journey to the correct stop.,1
1603, Why they allow them on the bus in the first place I don’t know.,0
1604,Hotel we are staying at in Agra is called the tourist rest house owned by the same people who owned our last hotel the Sunder palace.,0
1605," wifi occasionally,",0
1606, The person who picked us up tried to scam us for a visit to the Taj Mahal charging 650 ruppees for services that even he wasn’t really able to justify for the cost.,0
1607, He is also the waiter at the hotel restaurant.,0
1608, We decided to eat out the first night as the Hotel restaurant couldn’t cook anything we wanted and all we got was a blank look from the waiter.,1
1609,"I left the hotel feeling rough and sneezing due to the lack of sleep,",1
1610, Outside the hotel a very thin and very old Indian man peddled up to us at about 1 mph on his cycle rickshaw.,0
1611, He said no as the police were around and it may not be allowed so the guilt continued.,1
1612," which is a disappointment as we have heard it described as the dirtiest place in India and a real eye opener which is always good to hear,",1
1613, We got there for 6am like everyone recommended unfortunately as expected everyone else did this too so the queue was still big.,1
1614, After paying the huge 750 entrance fee and another queue we finally got in.,0
1615, I was expecting it to be a huge disappointment as it is hyped so much but it is good to see and well worth the trip and photo op.,1
1616, After that we went back to the hotel after the usual detour round the tuk tuk shops.,1
1617, I think I will stay here and help out in the restaurant and orphanage for a while and continue doing my yoga classes everyday!,1
1618, I'm sharing a room with this young 20yr old Canadian guy.,1
1619, The room is only costing me 150r which is so cheap!,0
1620, I am not allowed to buy anything after a yoga class.,1
1621, nehmen dann die Rikscha zum Hotel und checken aus.,0
1622,checken im Hotel ein und genehmigen uns eine Muetze Schlaf.,1
1623,Holi auch bei uns im Hotel Kleider-Opfer fordert.,1
1624,"Im Hotel zurueck,",0
1625, I have been confined to my room for most of today.,0
1626,gehen wir darauf nicht ein und wollen in ein Hotel in der Naehe.,0
1627," Wir klappern etliche Hotels in der Stadt ab,",0
1628," dass zwar alle Hotels Zimmer hatten,",0
1629,Hotel endlich fuendig.,0
1630,"Our small room was next to a common area,",1
1631,clothes and somehow managed to fall asleep again.,0
1632, until the glare became strong enough to cause a headache.,1
1633," In the center of the room were two tombs,",1
1634, The structure has never been washed—the monsoons do a good enough job of keeping it clean.,1
1635,"Dachterasse unseres Hotels erklimmen,",0
1636,"durch sind mit unserer Tour denken wir Shaid im Hotel anzufinden,",0
1637,"Zum Abendessen haben wir uns im Hotel angemeldet,",1
1638, Da wir sher müde sind checken wir in dem von Harish vorgeschlagenen Ankur Resort ein und buchen auch hier an der Rezeption eine- etwas teurere- Tigersafari für morgen früh.,0
1639, Als naechstes dann das gewohnte Bild: wir kommen an und wollen uns clever an den pre-paid Taxi Schalter begeben um nicht abgezockt zu werden.,1
1640," wo wir hin wollen und laesst uns ein Hotel ansehen,",1
1641,Hotel was very comfortable and the shower was not lacking in pressure or hot water which made the nights sleep very welcoming.,1
1642, The history of the country was told to us by our very informed guide and the names all run together but his love and pride of his beloved India came thru in every tale of the countries history.,1
1643, The next morning we returned to the Amber Fort to find our personal beast of burden the Indian Elephant waiting to take us up the hill to the entrance gate of the fort.,0
1644, The best part of the ride apart from the spectacular view of the valley was the respite it allowed us from the ever present street hawkers selling us every imaginable kind of trinket as a souvenir of our visit.,1
1645," We had been advised to stay for as short a time as possible,",0
1646, not even staying the night if feasible.,0
1647," For the sake of our sanity we hate to rush in and out of a place so we decided to stay for at least two nights,",1
1648, Thankfully the hotel we had chosen was liveable and we were delighted to find a beautiful rooftop garden awaiting us from which views of the Taj Mahal could not be surpassed.,0
1649, sharing facts and other novelties acquired from the guidebook which told interestingly of the Emperor Akbar’s many wives of different faiths from around the world whom he housed luxuriously in the grounds.,0
1650, The palace’s most lovely attraction was the Ornamental Pool and pavilion where we sat leisurely so as to fully enjoy.,0
1651,Soon we found ourselves on the rooftop of our hotel once again to eat a delicious dinner as the sun set about the Taj.,1
1652, We made our way to the West entrance and joined the small queue that had already formed.,0
1653," We didn’t wait long before acquiring tickets and then had to join another,",0
1654," The dawn light was not yet prevalent enough to properly illuminate the white marble and the paleness of the structure almost blended with the pallid,",1
1655, space enough to really enjoy it.,0
1656, This hollow room is shared also by pigeons and filled less than peacefully during daytime hours by ephemeral observers.,1
1657,Eventually and with regret we drew ourselves away from the Taj only to spend the remainder of our time staring at it fixatedly from our rooftop while we maintained our full bellies.,1
1658, A few days previous I sat in the jeep waiting to depart for Darjeeling and watched as an adolescent girl slapped a much smaller girl of about three years hard across the face.,1
1659, Now as we sat waiting we were given little warning as a beggar woman stood before us peeing down her legs and skirt.,0
1660," but all too often I am required to resort to the next stage; stare back,",1
1661," Lucky for us they stayed clear of our beds,",0
1662, tedious hours on the train passed I mentally checked out but Chris managed to make friends with some particularly lovely fellows from Assam.,0
1663,Crawling from one station to another just to wait for an hour before shuffling along again we were presented ample viewing time at the window.,1
1664, deciding in an unspoken agreement that it was her son’s responsibility to allow his mother to sit - but he sat their sneering.,1
1665,"Upon awaking the next morning in a hotel room,",1
1666, listening to the hustle and bustle of Varanasi and feeling spiteful toward Chris as he returned from a walk along the ghats buzzing with euphoria from experiencing the sights and sounds outside the hotel walls.,1
1667," The first day had not been such an issue for me as little was happening outside due to local elections that day,",1
1668,We extended our stay so that when I was recovered I would have time to fully appreciate the place.,0
1669," For this reason we never stayed long,",0
1670, not to mention I am not wholly comfortable watching a live cremation.,1
1671,After taking in all the sights we were returning to our hotel on the small wooden vessel.,0
1672, the people would never allow that to happen.,0
1673, surely a sense of empathy dictates that we should not allow the body to be eaten by dogs in the street.,1
1674,"Ten minutes later I found myself back in our hotel room,",1
1675," LkW und fremde Autos (bis auf Taxis) müssen neuerdings aus dem Ort draußen bleiben,",0
1676, weiß aber leider nichts (zum Glück gibt's Internet: http://www.,0
1677," und sage """"I just want to stay here and enjoy"""" - was er mit einem """"you enjoy evening time,",0
1678," der eine als """"makeup room"""" mit allerlei Farben und Blumen ausgestattet,",0
1679,"poi alla fine trovo un taxi mi porta in centro ,",1
1680,traffico impossibile come sempre e caos puro arrivo sul gange i taxinari ci restano male che non entro nei loro hotel o guest house cosi ci hanno perso la loro % .,1
1681,cosi con poca voglia mi prendo posto in un hotel ( parolone ) bettola per morti di fame suona meglio .,1
1682,"arrivo in stazione a katmandi e piglio un bel taxi 8 visto che sono fuori citta ) e sono all'hotel di carol ,",1
1683,piazzo la roba in una specie di Hotel vicino al taj Mahal e riesco ad buttarmi dentro .,1
1684,Alla fine son tornato all'hotel dove un socio di Ambrogio mi ha portato in altra stazione dove ho lasciato Agra per arrivare a Varanasi di primo mattino .,1
1685,We extended our stay in Hampi by another 4 nights.,0
1686,We found a lovely room in a guesthouse with a balcony overlooking the Ganges.,1
1687, Exactly what we wanted and it was the first room we looked at.,0
1688, They only have one room and the restaurant that's above it is one of the best in Varanasi.,0
1689, Only men are allowed at the cremations because women cry too much (so I was told) and in previous years the women threw themselves onto the fires out of desperation of losing the main breadwinner.,0
1690, You can watch the procedures but it's very likely that a 'guide' will approach you and ask you to follow him to a place where you are 'allowed' to watch.,1
1691,I was glad that I went to the smaller burning that first - it's not as 'commercial' there and I did get some interesting information there without paying.,0
1692, the accommodation wasn’t perfect as we were confined to the lodge compound between 5.,1
1693, Finally the weather here is dry like Adelaide which we much preferred to that of South East Asia and we had a large group of volunteers to socialise with whereas at Phnom Tamao we were alone.,0
1694,30am due to the horrible traffic congestion we headed straight to the airport arriving around 2pm while the others who were staying another week went into town to shop and have dinner.,0
1695," check in was efficient but strangely they have separate departure gates for men and women,",0
1696,The climate in Delhi was much cooler so it was fortunate that our driver Jitu and his boss Asif were waiting for us at the arrivals gate; Asif speaks French with an English accent which is very peculiar.,1
1697, It took quite some time to find our hotel but eventually we arrived around 8pm and enjoyed the buffet dinner before Ruth had herself a hot bath.,1
1698, where we gorged ourselves silly because it was included in the room price and we had no idea when we would eat again.,0
1699,"The hotel was our next port of call Jitu suggesting one that was average but clean enough,",1
1700," this wasn’t why we didn’t stay here that was the fault of the hotel manager who tried to charge me an exorbitant price for his rooms,",0
1701," I slid the paper covers over my shoes so that my sandals wouldn’t damage the marble and joined the small foreigners queue to the left of the mausoleums entrance,",1
1702," photography is not allowed inside but that did not deter the Indian’s in the least,",0
1703, Ruth waited outside with my sandals.,1
1704," 12 hours in an AC Tier 2 Sleeper Class,",0
1705, my siblings-in-law reliably inform me they are made of lentils and peas and are delicious.,1
1706, Sticking fastidiously to the rules (ie.,0
1707,"After the disappointment of Ranthambore,",0
1708, we decided to do things the easy way round in Agra and hired a rickshaw driver for the whole day.,1
1709, our plans were derailed when we found out that our train was no longer passing through Agra and that we would have to travel 60km by taxi to another town to catch our train!,0
1710, with a beautiful view of the Taj Mahal from our hotel window.,0
1711,"Hotel was a bit crappy - not so clean,",0
1712, Our guide was a nice enough guy ( I think ).,0
1713,Enough said.,0
1714, He also took us up a mountain to a cave which is again where Buddha stayed for 6 years and is also a place of pilgimage and worship.,1
1715,But the place that will stay with us the most is the Mahabodhi Temple.,0
1716," talking about all the different issues relating to the pursuit of true democracy in India that I'll bet was really interesting (I couldn't go due to my not being a youth anymore,",1
1717," Mom got sick that night and stayed that way for the next few days,",1
1718, waiting for the marble shop outside the Taj Mahal to open.,0
1719, very comforting after having spent so much time here.,0
1720," who is a taxi driver here,",0
1721," So I was happy in the end that we wound up staying in Jaipur,",0
1722,"We came toAgra on the bus and it was a pretty decent ride,",0
1723," at a shop in the middle of an industrial wasteland,",1
1724," We went into a shop to buy a postcard from a 12 year-old boy and wound up walking out with two marble tea light holders (one of those incredibly smooth salespeople that I apparently cannot resist),",1
1725, Another 5 hour drive this morning and we're now waiting in the Hotel Radisson before we board the overnight sleeper to Agra at 17:45 which should be .,1
1726, so we will have to resort to hotel Internet and cyber-shacks for the time being.,0
1727," wait for a gap in the traffic,",0
1728,a) Blare your horn maintaining your current course of direction and speed.,1
1729," This allows you to drive a car,",0
1730, Will provide an update on Bodh Gaya when we get to Agra (Internet-access notwithstanding).,1
1731, men aren't allowed during the birth of their children and woman are not allowed at the funerals.,0
1732," a coffee shop and bakery,",0

1845, It's fun and I am guessing the shop keepers are rolling their eyes thinking how dumb western tourists are.,0
1846, After a long uncomfortable wait both conductors convened around us and just at the pivotal moment when they were to send us to the treacherous back lurches of the train (where we would have to squeeze between the sweaty haunches of unfamiliar men for the next ten hours) when I asked to see their paper with list of passenger names.,1
