Our first lunch
A short summary of my three nights in Singapore; it was amazing, spend a night at the airport the first night, went to a gourmet dessert restaurant with an Italian the second and the third was Easter celebration with some wine and my dear friend Irmante from London, who showed me the city through her eyes!

So on the first of April Tatiana arrived from Bangkok and we met at the airport in Singapore...

...we arrived pretty late in Mumbai and it resulted in us taking a cab that was by far one of the sickest cabrides of my life and the impressions outside our window made this a head spinning journey. For almost one hour we raced along speople masses of people, noises, car honking, beautifully dressed women and more life in some streets than some cities might have.

our second day was by far the craziest, maybe it was because we were in our own, as we stayed by the end of the day with a host from couchsurfing, with whom we have been hanging out and walking around since. The first day we were in our own. I won't tell you about th food, as
Beautiful women
its too much, we have had everyday something different and are trying to discover as much as possible before we won't be able to look at the food anymore 😊

So our crazy day was basically full of people who wanted to take photos with us, then some overmotivated Indians who wanted to urgently help us and didn't take a no for an answer and decided to escort us to our destination and hang out with us, there more people (girls) just sat with us, just to hang out, they left and abrupt as they came.

Overall it has been very interesting, very colourful, the saris of the women make my head turn million times everyday, we took a train that had no doors, we had some many many different Indian meals, some we liked more, others less. So far, we drop dead every night because of all the impressions.

We are leaving to Goa tonight by train, looking forward to see more of this amazing country!!

Walk to Chowpatty Beach
After nearly missing the plane due to traffic on the M25, we boarded our 9 hour flight from Gatwick to Mumbai, arriving at 12.30am local time. We begrudgingly gave a porter 5 quid for carrying our bags less than 10 metres to a taxi and made it safely to our hostel 'Travellers Inn' after a lengthy drive past all the slums and stray dogs in the road.

Our first proper day in Mumbai began by being woken up to breakfast in bed - omelette, toast, banana and coffee. We ventured out of the hostel but I was quite nervous to go past the end of the road, since everything looked so different and chaotic and I thought for sure we would get lost. We got our bearings of the area, stopped for a drink to get out of the sun, and headed for Chowpatty beach. It was really nice walking along the wall by the sea and we even had a paddle in the murky water before getting our first curry (chana masala). Mumbai was a lot nicer than I thought it would be, everyone seemed very friendly, and it wasn't as dirty or smelly as people had made out (except for by the slums). I didn't even get stared at half as much as I thought I would which was a relief.

We went back to the hostel with intentions of booking a train ticket to Goa but instead fell asleep for 4 hours, probably from all of the heat and jet-lag. We awoke to find that my friend Pratik from Mumbai had tried calling the hotel four times and eventually we were ready for him to come pick us up. We went for a really tasty dinner that was too hot for me and then he drove us round on a night tour of Mumbai. He showed us the army and navy district Navy Nagar, where he had worked, another coast of Mumbai, and my favourite was the Banganga tank, which is this pool of clean fresh water that Pratik said nobody knew where the water truly comes from. It is believed that a god struck an arrow (Ban) into the stone to make the water flow continuously, and it is one of the oldest attractions in Mumbai, although I would not have liked to be there alone at night.

The next day the hostel staff told us that the trains to Goa were fully booked but they found us a night-bus that we could take that evening. We walked down to Colaba area, which has lots of stalls and then to the Gateway of India, from where we caught an hour-long boat to Elephanta Island (nope no Elephants, it got its name from the Portuguese explorers in the 17th century who found an elephant sculpture on the island but later dropped it in the sea after trying to take it home - it's now in Mumbai). We paired up with a German couple to get a guide to take us round the Hindu cave temples of Shiva, which are thought to have been carved between the 5th and 8th centuries. Even though there was a lot of damage to the carvings by the Portuguese, these were really spectacular to see, as well as the crowds of monkeys trying to steal people's food and drinks. On our way back down the 120 steps from the caves, we stopped off for a really tasty Goan fish curry, when our guide warned us against getting a night-bus to Goa, as 2 days before a driver was drunk and crashed the bus off a cliff, killing everyone. We did not want to hear this as we had already bought our tickets and wanted to get to Goa ASAP so we hoped that our driver would be safer, especially considering what had happened. We got the boat back to Mumbai and after frantically searching for the right street and bus we were finally on our way to Goa.

Mumbai or Bombay



The old capital city and the souvenier shopping stop







We arrived to Mumbai around 8 o ´clock in the morning and the bus dropped us off literally on he side of the highway. We got a cab that surprisingly said he would use the meter to take us to Colaba district. It took us a few other taxis that asked for an extremely large amount of money. We decided to stay in Colaba, which is a district in Mumbai where all the British colonial architecture characterizes it. It is also where most of the tourists stay and also where the few budget hostels are located. The taxi dropped us off near a few hostels and immediately an older Indian man greeted us and offered to take us to a hotel. We refused politely saying we knew which hotels to go and headed to the two hostels recommended by Lonely Planet. The hostels were in a building on the 5.th and 6th floor and after reaching both floors the receptionist told us they were all booked. We went outside and the same old man was there. He said he knew a couple of hotels near the area. We followed him and the first hotel was booked so he took us to a second hotel that was a little more local. They had room for the night and even though it was a little sketchy, not too well mantained, dusty and a little too much cramped we decided to stay there because it was only for one night.







We dropped our bags and chilled for a few hours and decided to go out and see a little of Mumbai. We realized that India is a large , very large country and to see it all we would have to take 1-2 or even 3 trips of a similar length and so with this in mind we decided to stop in Mumbai for souvenier shopping. What we did not know was that it would be really hard to shop for souveniers in Mumbai.







We head out and walked by the harbor all the way to the Gate of India. Along the way we passed a few upscale hotels including the famous and very expensive Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai. We passed a few colonial buildings to stop for some snacks and refreshments near the Gate of India. We continued to walk through a very busy street and passed an important government building and a National museum. We wanted to find the famous bazaars of Mumbai to shop for spices, scarves, little statues, incense and a few other cultural souveniers. We continued our walk passing India´s and possibly Asia´s largest and busiest train station. It was a semi modern with electronic boards , but at the same time it had India´s characteristics noisy, dirty and full of smells. We passed by quickly continuing our walk towards the north in search for markets. Kyle noticed a stamp store and he went in to get few stamps for him to use when marking assignments of his students. The stamps were going to be ready around 5 o ´clock so we had all day to pick them up. We passed a few markets , but they were mostly selling household supplies, fabrics, and none sold souveniers. As noon and lunch filled the air we found a local family restaurant and decided to eat lunch there. When we got in we noticed a bunch of men were wearing qipa and there was not a single women. The waiter old us to follow him upstairs to find a table for us. When we got up we realized that it was definitely a Muslim restaurant and the upstairs section was the only place where women were permitted. We ate some Muslim food and it was quite good. With our stomachs full we headed out to try to find more souveniers. Just as we decided to leave we saw a place selling scarves and so we went in and Kyle got a scarf for his niece and I got one for my sister. Then we ran into an indoor veggie and fruit market and went in to buy some spices. Kyle bought a chai to drink and I a fruit juice. We headed back to our hotel the same way we walked north. It was almost 5 o ´clock so we stopped at the stamp place and they said they the stamps were not ready so we decided to head in a taxi to a place called World Trade Center to get a few souveniers. The place was a group of modern buildings and the ne we were looking was building number 4. We got in and saw a couple of stores and office like places. We found two stores and bought a few things, but thought the vast majority was overly priced so we left , but as we were leaving I noticed a post office sign and we sent a few more post cards before leaving. We took a taxi to another store near our hotel and found a couple more souveniers this time at a better price , but we had to rush because it was near closing time. It was almost 8 o´clock and so we headed back walking for about 35 minutes to get Kyle´s stamps. On our way back we decided we wanted dinner and found a really good restaurant and when we sat down and looked ta the menu we realized it was all Chinese food. Since it was our last night in India we wanted something more Indian. We quickly left the restaurant and walked back to the main street where we found a whole block full of vendors selling, all kinds of street souveniers, We walked for a bit buying a few small souveniers for ourselves and our families and then decided to look for a restaurant. We found some Indian – Islamic restaurant and decided to stay there and ate one of the best kebab´s I have ever eaten, although it was a little spicy for me. We headed back to the souvenier street vendors shopped a little more and headed back to our hotel. Kyle arranged the taxi to the airport for the next morning and we took a shower and crashed for the night!







Our trip was over and we were ready to go back to Dalian, China. India was a fantastic very cultural travel experience and it touched my heart and soul. India made me a better person in many ways.







India until the next time! Namaste!







Shanti!!!

The Gates of India
There they are, in their magnificent glory, and this photo was taken from our hotel room window. No complaints.
I remember at one point back home, in the early stages of planning this trip, I had wanted to avoid Mumbai altogether, thinking it would be too much hassle trying to navigate one of the world's largest cities, with a population of twenty two million plus. I was so wrong, and I am so glad we came here.

Without a doubt, we lucked out with our hotel selection in the heart of Mumbai, one block away from the Gates of India, the famous Taj Mahal Hotel, and walking distance or a short ride away from all the major attractions. Situated right on the water, we had a view of the bay from our room, and spent our evenings blissed out by the beauty of all the boats sparkling in the water from the hotel's excellent rooftop restaurant, which also had sweet jazz music to add to the already awesome atmosphere. Thank you Trip Advisor reviewers.

Our first evening in the city, for about a buck, we took a forty minute night boat cruise of the harbour in front of The Gates. Nice mellow start to the weekend.

The next day we did a walking tour, along with two
The Bay
This was the bay view from our hotel room. Sweet.
other travellers, that was conducted by two University students. The tour promised to give us insights into how the people of Mumbai live. In addition to getting the historical background on some of the beautiful architecture in old Mumbai, we took trains, taxis, ate with the locals, saw the world's largest outdoor laundry service in action, and visited at length the home where Ghandi lived for many years. I found the Ghandi Museum visit to be very moving. Along with a collection of photos and beautifully done dioramas depicting the events of his life, we saw his enormous library, his spinning wheel still in its place where he had worked on it in his room, and a collection of original letters he had written or received, from notable historic figures, including Einstein and Hitler. And we learned, among many other things, that thefamous luxury hotel in Mumbai, The Taj Mahal, was built by this very rich Indian opium lord with a strong social conscience who built schools and hospitals and such in Mumbai with his illicit drug money. At the time hewas around, this other rich British dude, Sir Walton I believe, built this fancy hotel in Mumbai that did
Bev and Stan at the Taj Hotel
Yes, if only we wanted to drop a few hundred a night, we would actually be staying here. Or we could drop $2,500 like Madonna did, and take an entire suite here for a night. Not.
not allow people of color to enter, not even the rich cat opium lord. In response to this, the opium lord built the majestic Taj Mahal Hotel, and allowed entry by all colors, specifically to show that Indians don't discriminate. Nice story. And did you know that the University of Mumbai was designed by the same architect as Harvard?

The walking tour was a great intro to this beautiful city, which we followed up with a double decker bus tour later the same evening. We got another glimpse of the fabulous architecture and vibrant energy that pervades this city, as we watched people out everywhere, strolling the massive Chapatti Beach in the heart of the city; the enormous sea wall that extends for miles along Marine Drive, referred to as ""The Queen's Necklace"" because of the Bay's shape when lit at night; and the cricket fields that were always full of activity.

But I had to go beyond the lives of the middle and upper middle class, and so made a point of taking a tour of Dharavi, the largest slumin Asia, that was made famous by both the movie Slum Dog Millionaire and the novel Shantaram. With
Victoria Train Station
If you look closely you will notice a space in the centre of the building where there once was a statue of the Queen. Somebody apparently removed it one night, some thirty years ago. It has never been recovered.
the exception that the movie drew global attention to the existence of Dharavi, there is little else that the slum dwellers appreciate about the film, becauseits depictions of life there are all negative. The tour was presented by Reality Tours, and our young guide, who lived in another slum in Mumbai, kicked off the tour by asking each of the four of us in the group what our definition of a slum was. All of us came up with similar descriptors, like poverty, overcrowding, substandard living conditions, and depression. We were soon corrected, however, when told that the accurate definition of a slum is simply a place where people live, but do not have entitlement to the land. Reality Tours is committed to educating people about the vibrant community that exists within Dharavi - a community that has been there for generations - the infrastructure it has, and the millions of dollars it contributes annually to the Mumbai economy with the various industries it supports within the slum, such as recycling, pottery making, and fabric dying. In addition, a very high percentage of people who work in Mumbai's service industry live in Dharavi. It was extremely interesting and enlightening, and
Dharvi Ghat
This is the Dharvi Ghat, the world's largest open air laundry.
good to know that some of the money from the tour goes back to help establish community based programs there.

About the only thing we did not get off the Mumbai bucket list was taking in a Bollywood movie. This is a bit unfortunate, because touristos like us who can't understand a word of Hindi, and there are no English subtitles, only go to watch the apparently hilarious Indian audience that is anything but quiet during the movies. A definite missed cultural experience. But no worries. We will add it to the long list of things to see and do next trip.

Now we are off to the far north, to Kashmir, the Land of Saffron.

""Slumdog Millionaire"" or ""Shantaram"" can't do this city justice. How can they? My tourist brochure and guidebook both rightfully fawn over the city's stats and records. For instance, this peninsula city is the second biggest city in the world after Tokyo for population. Half of those, though, populate the biggest slum in Asia. Less than 5km from the slum is the most expensive house in the world. The city produces an unbelievable 40% of India's total GDP and is home to the flourishing art, literature, business and finance sectors of India, if not Asia. Bombay is as famous for her huge cinema industry as she is infamous for her crime. It's a city who's population has swollen beyond the perameters of human decency, yet continues to adapt, housing thousands of refugees and street families that arrive here from all over Asia and the Middle East each day. The facts are fairly impressive and they point to a metropolis that empitomises the Indian civilisation- from the Raj era through to the modern day. In the ""land of contrasts"" this is truly the capital. I'm at the end of my second stint here, after 5 days total in Mumbai, and have decided it's a city I can see myself living in one day.

From Bhopal, I stepped off the train at midnight onto the empty platfrom of Mumbai's Victoria Terminus - the busiest train station in Asia, apparently - and was hit instantly by the muggy heat that only a polluted inner city can generate. It was also very quiet - where were all the car horns!? Despite the unnaturally large rats on the tracks, the odour carried on the light breeze was not the usual sewage and rotting rubbish, but the smell of fish. This all made a terribly pleasant change, even if the stench of fish in the 30 degree heat isn't the nicest smell either. I got a taxi to a guest house I'd been given the card of by a tourist friend, and was depoited outside a grotty-looking building, in an alleyway where colour clearly came to die. I took the lift to the stiflingly hot fifth floor hostel and took a room. I found it very difficult to sleep.

Over the next two days, I made it my mission to see all the main sites, as I had not yet decided whether I'd return to Mumbai or head straight down to Goa. I first took a ferry from the Gateway to India (generic large arch, much the same as any other in the world but still swarming with tourists for some reason) which took me through the grimey harbour on southern Mumbai to Elephanta Island. The island might've once been a paradise, but has been utterly spoiled by industry and oil. The caves on the islands were reletively poor, espeically with the benefit of hindsight have seen Ajanta and Ellora now also.

I still had the whole afternoon to take in the southern tip of the city - from Colaba (tourist district) to the more up-market Fort area. My guide book, which is proving to be more hit-and-miss by the day, had mapped out a very good walking tour through the city, which I embarked on with gusto. The European and gothic architecture on the original buildings here is quite stunning, and very out of place. It really does feel like you're teleporting between London and Delhi as you walk. The city even has double decker buses and red telephone boxes! The most impressive of all the buildings is the train terminus that I'd blindly left the evening before. There are gargoyles, plinths, cloumns and arches like those on the exteroir of the natural history museum, yet the building blends these with a Taj Mahal-like array of domes and parapets that crown the building and somehow look totally normal atop the imprewssive structure. I bravely commanded a spot in the middle of the wide road to take anoptimally angled photograph of the front of the building only for a rage of taxis, bikes, motorbikes, buses and trucks to burst from behind me and engulf me in their chaotic hordes. It's not uncommon in Asia to find yourself in such a situation, and I now accept the circumstance as an opportunity to play real-life Frogger.

After walking lazily around some pretty dull modern art galleries (India still has some way to go in this department) I decided to go and see the slum that I'd read and heard so much about over years of geography class case studies. I took the new suburban train service to the nearest station. The squat slum settlements that illegelly but indefatigabally line the rail lines whizzed past as I hung out of the open doors to enjoy the cooling breeze (still a novelty and one that I'll miss when I return to the tragic Southeastern train service of Kent). Dharavi is the slum that the main characters find themsleves in at the opening of the Slumdog Millionaire film. It is fairly accurately portrayed. I was directed over the rows of railway lines, dodging rats and excrement, to the ""other side"" of the city by some nice Indian people who were amazed that I actually followed their direction. In response, I tried to swagger over them as if this is something I'd been doing all my life, and consequently came within 3 or 4 seconds of being obliterated by a train - they are surprisingly quiet! I must remember to look both ways before crossing the rails..

I was welcomed on the other side by some energetic kids. I'd swung my camera over my shoulder to the ""not in use"" position so as to cause no offense, but I was instantly asked by all the slum dwellers to take their photos. They laughed hysterically when I showed them their portraits, as if I'd performed an incredible magic trick. I was invited to sit down with some men who were playing a childrens' board game with real absorption; I was amused but quickly moved on into the slum. One of the kids who was particularly fascinated by the ability of my camera to take photos followed me in. I asked if he wanted to take me around, and he grinned and bounded away, doing cartwheels over the muddy ground. I had a guide. The lanes of the slum were claustrophobically small. the walls of houses eaither side really did lean in on one-another so that hardly any light penetrated through to ground level. I was plunged, therefore, into a dank and dark termite nest of alleys and walkways. I had to step into doorways to allow people through. Passing residents were fairly stunned to see me there - I think, though some tour operators do tours of the slums, they don't go to the parts accessed by crossing over 6 sets of railway lines. Like I'd read in Shantaram (a book that describes India and Mumbai in excellent detail, if anyone fancies devouring it's 1000 pages) the people of the slum were all friendly and clearly there is a great sense of community there.

I was just trying to gauge how much I could trust the happy kid who was weaving ahead of me, potentially leading me to some mafia boss in the depths of the slum, when we emerged back into the light in a reletively wide street. It was the main ""high street"" of the slum, and was the most bustling street of all those I've so far seen in India. I know I only penetrated an outer layer of the slum, and maybe one of the most affluent, but I was impressed with the level of sophistication that had developed there. Every single piece of scrap material or rubbish had been collected and was being laoriously sub-divded into towering piles of colourful trash on either side of the street. Tiny chai stands, fruit sellers and entreprenurial frying pan-weilding fried food salespeople were barking at the passing crowds. Business was clearly thriving in Dharavi - my guidebook reliably informs me that the annual turnover of the slum tops some $665million! I asked to be lead out of the slum to the public access point (a bridge over the tracks) and the kid jumped away again through the traffic of people. We passed little industries along the whole way, including little sweat shops and independant schools, clinics and gyms. After an hour in the slums, the boy proudly raced up the steps of a bridge ahead and thrust his arms out triumphantly. I shook his hand and was about to give hime some money when he bounded away again to rejoin his friends. Maybe hanging out with a ""cool"" foreigner was payment enough. I'm sure the slums are still awfully horrible in many places, but much of the slum that I explored felt legitimate, friendly and clean (""India clean"", not ""England clean""). All over the slum area, high-rise housing could be seen shooting up to try to accomodatethe slum dwellers in some kind of order and with electricity and running water. Perhaps the government and charities are finally acting to better the lives of those forced to live in Dharavi.



The slum was probably the most interesting experience I had in Mumbai. I've also been out drinking with some Indians and a middle-aged Frenchman in the infamous Leopold's Cafe, amoungst others. I even caught some of the Grand Prix and the WHU Chelsea game!

I will be leaving down the coast tomorrow morning on a catamarn. I have nothing booked, I just fancy finding a little chunk of paradise to collapse on for a week!

Hope all are well and continue emailing me with news etc - it's always nice to hear from home.

colourful colaba
my very first trip to mumbai was also the first evening flight for me and the thrill of watching twinkling lights both during take off and landing when youre 12 years old was exhilirating. We drove to the Oberoi Towers and checked into two interconnected rooms and saw the queens necklace dazzling from below. It was so beautiful. The next morning I remember our parents ordering room service for us and there were chole batures and I do remember this warm feeling of love I felt for mum n dad as we embarked on our trip to europe and america. for lunch we drove down to malabar hills to visit an ailing relative and the family. I also recollect watching cable tv for the first time at the hotel and also spotting a celebrity in the lobby. enough of excitement for a twelve year old as we inched through loads of traffic on the way to the international airport to catch an air india flight to rome. on the return journey dad was waiting for us at the airport as mom, me and the brothers landed from uk on an air india flight. we checked into the centaur hotel for a
view of apollo bunder from the sea
night and i remember ordering coke and there was none. coke wasnt available in india in 1985 so thumbs up it had to be. the next day early morning we left for our home in kolkata.

the second trip to mumbai was under completely different circumstances. three of us from university had been selected to appear for the final interview with an automobile company. we left for mumbai by train and one of the friends uncle met us at dadar station and we walked down to a guest house nearby. we stayed there for a night and moved to cuffe castle the next day. the apartment was neither too big nor too small and all three of us were thrilled to be staying on cuffe parade. we could see the swimming pool of the taj president from our balcony as well as the world trade centre where our interview would be conducted. we walked down to the venue and i slipped up at the final stage, nevertheless, we were asked to complete our medicals and we explored a bit of south mumbai. i do remember apollo bunder, cuffe parade and a nearby shopping destination. this trip didnt leave me
mumbai docks
with very good memories and so i will end the narrative here.



in the year 2000 my bro was working in mumbai and it was decided that i would land up to meet him there. we stayed at the ywca international guest house on madame cama road and this would be one of several trips to the ywca. we walked down to the taj for coffee at night and visited my cousin at his home. a short trip but it would lead to me moving to mumbai that year in december.

in december when i landed up at the ywca my nerves were at their very end because i had supposedly moved here to look for a job and settle down. i tried giving some interviews and went about visiting placement consultants. an interesting old gentleman gave me some valuable insight into life in mumbai and his memories of a bygone era in kolkata. eventually my bro would help me find a pg and i would find myself a job with a medical instrumentation company into imports. within a month i would fall in love with bandra and its churches specially because it was christmas and
from the yacht club
it was all so quaint and pretty. i moved into a sharing accommodation and settled into a routine job for all of five months before moving into my uncles house in carter road and moving back to kolkata. sometime in december that year i would travel to ahmedabad for the first time to attend a doctors conference and also caught up with my cousin living there with her family. in february i would go to elephanta caves with a friend, they are exquisite rock cut caves but i must mention the monkey menace there. living in mumbai was a bit overwhelming and i now realise i just didnt have it in me to travel by local trains and live in a pg for months at end until i found my groove. during my stay my dad would visit me and my bro in mumbai and we would have the pleasure of his company and good food at the taj mahal, copper chimney and few such exotic locations. we would all stay together at the royal bombay yacht club. my youngest bro would also visit us and we would travel to elephanta caves together. i do recollect the togetherness we all felt although we were dead broke most of the time. i flew back to kolkata in may 2001.

sometime in 2001 october i would visit mumbai again and this time it was the pujas and i remember my bro and me visiting pandals in dadar and town and lokhandwala. was it this time or the last time, i have to jog my memory but i recollect bumping into several known faces from kolkata at the lokhandwala pujo. also met up with cousins and shopped in shoppers stop, andheri, ate at cafe mondigas and mcdonalds. my bro and me also visited the prince of wales museum. on one of these trips i would travel all the way to bandra kurla to catch a train back home.

in 2002 may or june i would visit mumbai to stay by myself at the same oberoi towers. some strange impact and circular life forces would compel me to make this journey and theres not much to write about it.

in 2004 i would visit mumbai to stay with a friend, a dear family and school friend and her family consisting of her daughter and her husband in their apartment in prabhadevi. a delightful small and tidy place overlooking the sea. i was there on work and would be at there place for almost three weeks. i met up again with my bro and cousin and later on mum would join us in mumbai and we would all stay together at the ywca. mum and me strolled down to leopolds and had dinner and we would also go to chowpatty and mum would buy shoes from colaba. i also visited the sidhhi vinayak temple from my friends place and we bid each other a tearful farewell and returned to kolkata. that year in november after putting on some extra kilos following disastrous personal life i would be back in mumbai for a day once again on work and return by the evening flight.

in 2005 february i had joined a different company and was hoping for work culture to change in the new setup only to find that i had slipped into an eerie and gloomy office and very soon i would be out of it. this time i was put up at a hotel in juhu and i remember being cooped up in it for most of the time that i wouldnt spend at work in my training. the hotel was right next to prithvi theatre and i would walk down to it and buy some tuck for folks back home.

in 2006 september i joined an fmcg company to find myself going to mumbai almost 15 times. i would stay athe company guest house for days at end and once the company had almost moved me to mumbai and i managed to ease back home out of homesickness. having an mnc salary guaranteed that we went shopping regularly and having an expense account and a cash rich company to sponsor you we would be eating our hearts out at several fine dining outlets. a conference took us to amby valley and it was all so man-made beautiful. another one took us to orange county, coorg and while all other collegaues left for their home towns i went back to mumbai and the empty guest house. i did manage to build up my shoe collection from aldo and nine west as well as kolhapures from the oberoi mall. j'adore followed and a range of kurtis from a 'w' sale in bandra, anokhi and the westside store at grant road. i would eat little and managed to lose a lot of weight and dressed up for fashion week parties and the grand finale. i remember sleepovers at my boss' place at lokhandwala and bargain shopping for nina ricci lipsticks. the last time i had stayed at lokhandwala was during my pg days when my bro was sharing an apartment with his friends. one of the conferences was at the mariott and though i didnt join my colleagues at the night club i remember dozing off in that luxurious bed after a hard days work and the breakfast buffet. the last trip to mumbai was a conference at our learning centre in gulita specific to our division. we partied at the phoenix mills and i kind of resigned post that and moved to delhi to join my husband there.

after almost 5 years this january i went back to mumbai with my hubby this time to consult doctors as a patient. hubby and me stayed at the ywca and we visited popular landmarks which had meant so much to both of us in our single days and now that we were together we combined our memories. i showed him the learning centre, rode on the sea link and visited starbucks. we ate at delhi durbar, leopolds, walked through the trident and oberoi, took a ferry ride on the ocean and caught a flight back to bengaluru from the new terminal. the next trip we were rushed but found time for cuffe parade while i constantly narrated my interview days and ate at status restaurant, a first time for me. the next day we went back to starbucks and bought my medicines before returning home.

in february this year i would land alone in mumbai, my hubby had a meru cab waiting for me and i came into town and then returned to the airport to collect my parents and we checked into the yacht club at the suite. much negotiations followed with dad over the extra bed and the change of room but we still managed to have a good time. dad treated us at the taj, twice and at the pizza place and jehangir art gallery. we visited siddhi vinayak for a superb darshan and drove through malabar hills to reach the yacht club again. one day we ate at the dining room at the club and everyday breakfast would be laid out at a sun-kissed breakfast room overlooking the taj hotel. we even managed to go to starbucks and the taj president, oberoi and trident hotels. but mom was complaining as usual and we came back. i packed some chocolates from the taj president sugar & spice for dad and they too packed some for home. on the 9th hubby arrived and this time we explored a bit of bandra, pali naka where i used to stay, their home off hill road, sharukh khans bungalow and the rest of it. we also drove down to bandra kurla complex to maker maxity and i gorged on eclairs at le pain quotidien while i waited for hubby. we went to sidhi vinayak but it was a special day and there were hundreds of devotees so there was no way we could enter the temple. on my first trip i shopped for pjs at colaba but this time stayed away from colaba. we visited the phoenix mills and i shopped at mango and marveled at how the shopping complex had evolved over the years. we tried to catch our breath over some salon treatments and towards the end of the visit trooped to our favourite joints, starbucks and sugar n spice at the taj president, where earlier we had had a scrumptious thai meal. we came back to Bengaluru convinced that mumbai had given us back so much.

Mumbai airport

My flight arrived at the international airport of Mumbai at 11:55PM and my first impression of India was watching all the local people get respectfully and politely on the bus from the airplane to the terminal. In spite of being the largest population in the world I could observed that they were polite and a little more organized and less rude than their fellow Chinese neighbors. I entered immigration and noticed a bunch of lines: visitors, locals, business travelers, visitors with Indian working permits, etc. I could tell that it was a well organized airport. I went through immigration and baggage quickly and without much hazard and headed to find an exchange money place. After I found one I noticed the rate was so crappy compared to the one Kyle had told me and the one my iPod exchange convertor had. Anyway I had to exchange money so I did, but just exactly what I needed and maybe just a little more I case I needed it. After I left the arrivals area I walked out to the waiting area and the big commotion and Indian craziness started. Lots of people waiting for visitors there was not a single open space behind the metal bars of the waiting area. Loud and desperate to get a client taxi, rickshaw and bus drivers following people around to get them a ride. It was madness! Luckily, I had requested a pickup and did not have to go through this hazard although it took me three rounds of walking around the waiting area to find a small Indian man with a very small sign that said my name and Kailvayadhana. By the time I found him it was almost 12:30 AM . So we walked through a parking lot to the van that was going to take me to the yoga ashram. This situation remind me a little of Venezuela and the international airport, where you have to request someone to pick you up and do not trust anyone that may seem untrustworthy. Finally in the van the 2.5 hour journey through Mumbai's slums and to the ashram started. It was dark and late so there was not much to see. I did observed that lots of Indian people drive motorcycles including two men together, this has never been something I trust. I always think they might be robbers, kidnappers or some sort of vicious people. I say this because I saw a lot and the looks on their faces as they saw me looking through the car window was not very friendly and I actually wished the car had darker window panes. Anyway the ride continue through neighborhoods low class and slums with garbage everywhere and the smells, oh the smells. a mixed of Indian spices: cumin, turmeric, curry and others combined with garbage, sweat and smoke from cars. It was really hard to breath with the smell. I was exhausted from flights being delayed sleeping on a plane and being uncomfortable so I slept most of the ride. We got to the ashram at 2:30 AM and I got my room (very basic) and fell asleep to some soft calming music.

I woke up at almost 8:00 AM and the first thing I did was to take a shower and so I grabbed my toiletries bag and clothes and towel and headed to the common bathroom hoping no one was there. Luckily for me no one was there because it turned out to be a mix man and woman bathroom although it did have separate toilets and shower rooms for man and woman.

I went in the woman's shower room and to my surprise no hot water I even turned on the hot water and waited, but very little came out and the weather was not warm since the ashram is in the mountains on the outskirts of Mumbai. so I had to have a cold water shower! Brrrrrr!!!!!

After the shower breakfast was served and it was in a small wooden dining room with some tables of 8-10 people and another area very small with small benches and pillows to sit on the floor just like local Indian would do. This area was reserved for students although I think we can sit and eat wherever we want and there is not much of a restriction just to pray and eat silently. . The kitchen is kind of industrial, but in a smaller dimension with an open window to get the food and another one to put dirty plates and a table where the food, tea and utensils are displayed.
All the food is cooked without garlic nor onions and only salt and a few herbal plants . The reason for this is to detox your body and allow you to be lighter and at peace. Apparently garlic and onions make your blood too hot. Breakfast was some sort of thick yellow porridge with a few veggies and some chai (milk tea) or ginger tea, both of which I really like!

After breakfast, I went to the main office to check in and pay and to the doctor who diagnosed me with anxiety, nervousness and stress as well as with sinus and constant colds. He told me to do yoga twice a day and a breathing class and to have naturopathy treatments twice during the day.

I hang out on the terrace of the main ashram house and watch other people mostly Indian, a few Chinese, some Spanish, a German guy, a British girl and a few Indian that spoke English. I read for awhile and started my blog and at 11.:00 I went to my first treatment of naturopathy.

The naturopathy center is like five minutes from the main area and you walk around some walking park and some fresh veggie and herbal plant garden. You really feel at peace here. So I arrived at the center and showed my little membership book with all my information and was told I would get a facial, head and neck coconut oil massage and an inhaler with some leaves for my sinus.

The coconut oil massage felt great! massaging my head, neck and face felt so un stressful and relaxing I felt at ease. The only problem I found was that after the massage my hair was so oily and it was really hard to get it cleaned without hot water. The second treatment was toner my face and breath some leaves in boiling water this was for my sinus. It was good but i had to stop and breath air every other time because it was really hot.

Then lunch was served and again it was very healthy vegetarían meal. i sat with the Brítish girl and we chatted for a bit . i was feeling calmed , but a bit tired so I went to my room and listened to my meditation podcast and took a nap. At 3:00 I headed to the naturopathy center for my second daily treatment which was a warm water massage. i got in a tub of warm water, actually really hot and the woman turned it on and shots of water came out onto my legs, arms, stomach and back. It felt good but it was a little harsh.

the next hour or so I spent it walking and reading and at 5:00 it was time for asana yoga. The class was a beginners and even though I have done yoga before and it was easy for me there were some new postures that I had not done before and also I haven't practiced yoga on a daily basis since I moved to China. I was ok with the level and it really felt great. Then we headed to the pranayama yoga upstairs near the doctor's office. This class was basically just for breathing and learning to use your breathing effectively which helps during stressful, anxiety and worriness situations.
Dinner was served and then I went to a yoga and self development lecture. I did not pay too much attention as I was really tired and falling asleep.
I went back to my room and talked to Kyle who was on his way to Delhi and Manali for some skiing and then I will see him on Sunday.

It was a great day and here are my learnings:


• be patient
• be yourself
• do not depend and expect too much then if you do you will be hurt is better not to depend and expect and be surprised 4.I am learning to control my body and mind Namaste!

Feb. 7th- 8th, 2013

Friday I woke up at the usual time for my morning meditation, 6:00 AM, as it was a chilly brisk morning I decided to stay in bed wrapped in a warm blanket and meditate there. I began my meditation, about being able to be free and let the mind stop controlling my thoughts, actions, feelings and others, by taking a few deep breaths inhaling and exhaling on a count of 4 inhaling deeply holding the air and exhaling on the count to 4. It is an exercise I learned at the pranayama class and I have been using it as a tool to release my nerves, anxieties and worries. It really works! After this breathing. exercise, I listened to the guided meditation by Deeprak Chopra center about letting go of control. It was a good meditation to start the day. Then I did another exercise learned at pranayama. It is to help you be more energetic and awake. You start with a deep inhale and the a deep exhale and then you breathe normally, but when you exhale you do it in short and fast exhales and letting go a whiff of air. After these positive and active early morning rituals , I went to the yoga class. As usual we did a few of the same exercises I had done in the morning and then continued with some back stretches. We did a few more advanced poses and I was really focused on my breathing and therefore I was much more flexible and could do better some of the few poses.
I ate breakfast and then went for a calming morning walk around the ashram. I walked by some indian workers fixing the flower and plant garden of the naturopathy and Ayurveda treatment. There was some rosemary, jazmin, lavender, and other plants and herbs used for medicinal treatments. The sun was shining and there was a cool breeze in the air that made the weather the perfect one for a outdoor walk. I saw the british girl and we agreed to go for a walk or rickshaw tour to the little town of Lonavla in the afternoon.
This morning I had a facial steam and neck and hair massage along with an abdomen massage.
The morning flew by quickly and lunch was served and then Nathalie and I headed out in the van of the transportation man (free ride to town but we had to tip him ) to the town. First we drove by some up scale residential area full of big and old house, but very well maintained and they all seemed to be owned by a middle class family. The roads were all broken and covered with dirt, sand from construction and garbage , but if you saw straight ahead you did not see this instead you saw a street with tall trees on each side of the road and so tall and full of leaves that they made a natural tunnel. It was a peaceful calm neighborhood in spite of being only about 5 minutes from the main street to the town. We arrived to a residential area and a family house where the owners had a bags and suitcase shop. Nathalie got a backpack and then we headed into town. We were dropped at a street where we wandered for a bit and saw the rickshaws, crazy driving, lots of street dogs and lots and lots of Chikki vendors. Chikki is an indian snack that looks like a pane of brick and it comes in many flavors and the vendors simply cut it in squares and sell it by kilograms-grams. My friend Agnes recommended it to me and so I went to a shop to get some. My idea was to get some for Kyle but when I asked the flavors they were all with nuts and Kyle is allergic to them so oops sorry Kyle no yummy chikki for you :-( i got some chucolate with nuts , coconut and sesame for me and a few mixed flavors to take to Tim and Agnes, It was very tasty! After a few minutes wandering. We decided to go back to the ashram as it was time for our second treatment.

After the treatment came yoga and then. meditation. I decided to do my own meditation using my podcasts because I barely understood the indian teacher and it was not really what I wanted to do so I walked to the little flower park in the ashram and lay down my sarong and sat down for my private little meditation. The air was cool, but a little bit of the warmth of the sun you could still feel and so it made a great outdoor meditation place and time. this time I meditated about being grateful and thankful for all I have in life and the opportunities I have been give and the people that I have met along the way, specially in my time in China. I felt relaxed and ready for my last day of yoga and meditation a the ashram and for he beginning of a fun adventurous trip through the desert of India with Kyle.

After dinner I went to my room read and watch some science videos and fell asleep in a deep state only to wake up the next morning by the little birds singing awakening and welcoming the new day.

Feb. 9th, 2013

Saturday I woke up and did my usual meditation practice along with some breathing exercises and then went off to yoga. The class started like usual some meditation and relaxing poses and exercises. I could feel the air on my face and skin and the heat of the morning sun as I was breathing and practicing yoga. The practice went like the other ones for most of the time and when it was almost time to finished about 15 minutes before the teacher asked us to lay down in shavasana (relaxing pose) and close our eyes feel our breath and simply put our mind in blank.

After yoga I had scheduled an early treatment at the naturopathy center because I had been having issues with my stomach so they wanted to do some abdomen wrapped up and massages before I ate. First thing they did was they gave me an oil abdomen massage , which felt great and really helped me with my stomach issues. Then they wrapped me in some bandages around waist and abdomen and let me lay down for a while and then something really weird happened. The lady that was doing the treatment came with a bag that looked like an IV hospital bag filled with water and a few lemons and asked me to follow her. We went through some smaller rooms and out through a terrace all the way to the outside of the center to a small room with a bed and a hook next to it. I was starting to feel something awkward was going to happen . And well my feeling was right. The lady asked me to undressed and take off my pants and underwear and lay down on my front. I immediately was like Why??? !!! and she said “anal treatment” and that was when I realized what the lady from be office had said they were going to do to me and because of her heavy indian accent I barely understood! I told the lady that I did not want this and that I thought it was supposed to be drinking water with lemon and that I did not feel comfortable. doing this. She tried to persuade me saying it did not hurt and it will be only one minute and it was great for me, but I did not give in no way!!!!

in the end they did another abdomen massage and of course every time one of the massage ladies walked by me they whispered and giggled as if I was a weird girl who did not want to have an anal treatment done and that made me strange.

After this whole experience I was late for breakfast so I headed to my room ate some chikki and watch some videos and fell asleep until after lunch. I felt really tired and did not feel like going out do I stayed in my little comfy and cozy room until it was time for my treatment.

I went for a walk and then to my last treatment which was a water and abdomen massage and facial steam.

The yoga class was also as usual and this time I felt even more relaxed, flexible and focus to perform most of all the poses including some that I had never done. The evening ended with. dinner along with an after dinner chat with the british, brazilian, australian and indian girls and the french guy. I went to bed feeling so better with my self at peace and calmed!

2nd day at the ashram

Today was my first full day in the ashram. I woke up at 6:15 AM shivering by the cold breeze. The ashram is in an area north of Mumbai in the outskirts near the mountains and so the weather can be cool specially before and after sunrise and sunset. I sat down in the bed and started a thankful meditarion. It helped me see and remind me what are the positive things in my life and what is really important. I felt so great and at peace that the morning yoga practice went through so easily and naturally.

After the morning session of yoga, which I have to say was really relaxing and helped stretch and learn basic poses I felt light and so thankful for this experience. I also have to say the practice is really easy for me even though I haven't done yoga on a daily basis since I moved to China I feel pretty comfortable with the poses the teacher tells us to do, so I might try to get into a more intermediate advanced yoga class tomorrow and see what I can do and what I can be challenged at.

Breakfast was ok the usual veggie meal. I have started to feel a little heavy because I have been eating all vegetarian non lacto meals which I am not used to and my stomach feels heavier than before. Also I have been having a runny nose and it might be the facial steam with mint leaves the naturopathy doctor told me to do. apart from this two little issues I have been feeling way too good! Calm,, peaceful, relaxed, at ease and so so much better with my life and my self.

After breakfast I took a short walk and read a book my mom gave me about ideas to live a healthy happy life and to find yourself and I also read a book about India called: Behind beautiful forevers. Both books are fabulous for this occasion and I like to alternate them every other time.

My naturopathy treatment was at 10:30 and it was a relaxing leg massage. They wrapped my legs with some bandages and massage me which is good for circulation and since I have been flying so much the last couple of years this actually helps a lot because I have been having really bad leg cramps and numbness feeling on them. I then headed to my room for some reading and then lunch.

After lunch it was rest time so I took the time to meditate and nap. it was so relaxing I fell deeply asleep and woke up at 3:20 and almost missed my naturopathy treatment. I literally ran to the center and when I arrived I knew by the looks that they were not happy. Anyway all I could do was apologize and make sure I was on time next appointment. My treatment was an oil body massage, a face and body steam. It felt so good seriously better than massages in Dalian :-) I took a warm shower to remove excess oil and headed to my afternoon yoga class.

Yoga today was a bit more challenging and I liked it more. I think I am the most advanced student In the class. I had some breathing exercises which help me tons with my respiratory problem and also with my anxiety. Then we did some Pilates -yoga leg exercises to tone our legs and stretch muscles. The teacher is getting better at giving immediate feedback to us when we do a pose. I think the first day some girls complained about him not giving feedback and the staff most have told him something. anyway tomorrow I will try the advanced class and se e how it goes.
The pranayama (breathing) yoga felt better today. I am starting to breath properly and now I can chant “ommm shanti” for a longer time without getting tired and out of breath.

Dinner was really yummy. Red pumpkin soup, some veggies with a sauce and brown rice with chapati ( thin bread) and some chai. I sat with the French guy, British girl and other Indian girls and we talked about the yoga and food. It turns out all of them except the British girl and I are doing Panchakarma which is a practice which involves detoxing and you eat without any oil. I which I had known of this before maybe I would have done it .
The day went really well and I am learning to be by myself and enjoy reading writing and meditating. Namaste!

India - (1580)
Day 32: Mumbai -
With the realization that to really see and experience India, at least 1-2 similar sized trips would have to be made, so for that reason we made a decision not to spend much time trying to see sights but instead shop for souvenirs (turned out to be harder than previously thought).We arrived in Mumbai in the morning, although at a more respectable time. Our bus dropped us off on the side of a highway leading into the city, a little past the airport. The first couple of taxis quoted exorbitant prices but a third one to our great surprise offered to use the meter! The meter! It had been so long since I had seen a taxi use a meter, that I had totally forgotten about them. That said I was still suspicious and watched to meter like a hawk to make sure there was no funny business. There was none. It was a 40 minute ride through the city to the district of Colaba. Colaba is the district with all the remnants of the British built architecture. The damage was 200 rupees.We got dropped off near a couple of hotels. An older man greeted us most
India - (1581)
likely trying to make commission, greeted us and tried to take us to a hotel. We refused instead trying to other hotels first as he led us to them, or more specifically walked ahead of us so that he could take credit for bringing us there. Both hotels were full. We tried the hotel he recommended but also full. We tried a fourth more local hotel and the had space but it was a cramped style and not terrible well maintained or cleaned. We walked out towards some of the colonial buildings including the famous and expensive Taj Mahal Palace hotel, the Gate to India, and then towards by a few of the other buildings. We walked to the so called ""busiest railway station in Asia"" but having spent more than 24 hours in the past month in Indian railway stations, it wasn't terribly interesting. While in, I noticed a man watching us suspiciously and when we walked by he immediately started to follow. I took a sharp turn into an out of the way section and he followed us. I confronted him with a directed ""hello"". He tried to touch our feet, but we walked away and he seemed
India - (1582)
to take a hint. Afterwards we headed north in search of markets. We walked for some time finding only a few uninteresting ones while an Islamic man's angry voice was blasted around the districts, preaching about something.We found a local family restaurant. We were directed to the top floor while men ate downstairs. We realized that ""family restaurant"" means separate place for groups containing women. The food was good. We walked around more. It was mostly supply stores selling various electronic and household goods. No souvenirs. Just before we were about to leave we found a place selling textiles, and bought a couple of things. Then we found a large indoor vegetable market and bought some spices. We headed back and caught a taxi to a place where we thought we could find souvenirs: a small mall called the World Trade Centre. Entrance to the mall required two security checks, but inside was pretty empty with a few stores on each floor, with lots of closed unsigned places. We bought a couple of things but felt it was overpriced. We caught a taxi back out to near our hotel where there was another store, bought some more souvenirs and then
India - (1583)
we found a long street full of cheaper roadside vendors so we did one last shopping bit. I had ordered some custom rubber stamps and walked 30 minutes to go pick them up. On the way back we stopped for dinner at what looked to be a very good restaurant, but it turns out it was Chinese food. Being our last night in India before going back to China, we wanted Indian food. We did find a restaurant that made Indian food inspired by the Islamic kebab style. The food was excellent but a bit too spicy for Ale.When we headed back, I organized the taxi to the airport the next morning for 500.

Mumbai (Bombay)

13th February 2013



A sombre cloudless sky greeted us on arrival in Mumbai, defused by localised smog laying heavily over the bay, but after the 1C and snow we left behind in the UK, the 30C of Mumbai is decidedly welcome once refreshed with a cool shower.

There is safety in numbers, or so I've been told. That might indeed be true for wildebeast crossing the Serengetti, for vast flocks of birds fending off predators in flight or armies preparing for battle. Evidence, however, suggests it's not so much the roll of the dice but where you choose to roll 'em. Mumbai's 20.5 million people cram this city on the Bom Bahia or 'Good Bay' as the Portuguese called it when they first arrived. For now, let's call it Bombay.

There's a certain rhythm to Bombay; or perhaps it's more a bang and a rattle, setting the heart racing and the eardrums vibrating. Traffic here makes a Monday morning rush-hour on London's M25 seem like an afternoon picnic. For here the main roads throng with high-revving tuk-tuks, fume throwing
Dhobi Ghat
motorbikes, scooters galore three-up and helmetless, huge hand-wielded carts overladen with white sacks of washing for delivery to-and-from the Dhobi Ghat, throw in the odd cow and goat for good measure and many thousands of black and yellow taxis honking ' I'm behind you!'

The city's central streets are clean, cared for by an army of sweepers in recent times, and traders of all things from trinkets and bracelets to watches and puppets line the streets alongside sellers of fruit and vegetables. Vegetating bodies wrapped in scruffy blankets lay in the shadows in sublime peace, day and night, beside mangy dogs and pavement dwellers sorting through piles of refuse in the backstreets. Hawkers of peacock-feather gifts, giant balloons and garlands all ply their trade amongst the tourists with friendly though somewhat persistant advances, on streets alive with the delicate fragrance of joss-sticks and cow pats.





But for us it's the comfort of the very friendly and very central Suba Palace Hotel. Around the corner an orderly youthful queue awaits the next perfomance at the local cinema, passing through security detectors and wand-waving police to feast their eyes on the latest offerings from Bollywood. Crowds
The true scale of life
of holidaying Indians make their way to The Gateway of India, built to commmemorate the arrival of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911, in the heyday of the Raj. With the coming of Valentine's Day comes the prospect of both love and hate, hand-in-hand with memories of Al Capone and more recent events here in town, and security measures have been put in place ahead of any trouble. Security scanners guard the cordoned off walkway to The Gateway and all who enter will be scanned and their luggage screened. The same process greeted us on our way into the Taj Mahal Hotel just across the road, to absorb the ambience of the affluent over a welcome cool beer at European prices.

Western dress prevails amongst the men on the street, though tradition remains strong with ladies in vibrant, dazzling saris, resonating in the fine stir-fry of culture in this openly liberal city where money is seemingly more important than religion - and anything is official, given an original and three carbon copies.

Victorian and Art Deco buildings are much in evidence around the city; the Victoria Station, The Town Hall, the Art Deco Regal Cinema, The
Street kids
Gateway and many others surrounding the The Maidan Oval cricket ground where a dozen or more games were in progress. We resisted the temptation to yell, 'Come on England', aware of the potentioal to riot - and the many black kites soaring overhead.

Mike had been thinking ahead as usual and booked a city tour with Reality Tours and Travel on the basis of 'if it's good enough for Prince Andrew it's good enough for us'. The tour took us to the Dhobi Ghat and the now rather famous Dharavi slums. Surprisingly, more than 50% of Mumbai's population still live in slums around the city, where Hindu and Muslim work hand-in-hand as Gandhi would have wished it, recycling trash from within the city and beyond; both the USA and China send their rubbish here. Reality have forged a bond with the inhabitants of Dharavi, dedicating 80% of their profits to community projects within the slum. Our guide, Dinesh, is known to everyone there, allowing us to meet the locals at their work, sorting, grinding and recycling huge grubby sacks of plastic, piles of tin cans and cardboard, smelting aluminium, sewing, fabric printing, drilling, welding, painting, ironing. We were met

with a wave and a smile in every dingy doorway, along dark and narrow garbage-strewn alleyways flowing with often open-sewers, where chickens and cats prowled past sleeping dogs, a listless tethered goat watching, doe-eyed, as the next thousand goat-skins hit the washtub, up steep steel staircases to corrugated roofs scattered with yesterday's rubbish and kids playing cricket, barefoot in the puddles. On the fringes were school kids in their smart uniforms, girls with pig-tails, calling and waving to us, 'Take our picture! Where are you from? How are you today?' Prudence suggests no photography in Dharavi.

But money is not greater than God. This pulsng centre of commercial activity of Dharavi is overlooked by fast-decaying tower blocks, shanty homes and the glass towers of modern society.beyond their wildest dreams. Reality are doing their bit to change things here. Their English School is working well with support from tourists, but it is equally reality that these seemingly happy people are cleaning up this world we contiue to pollute with our consumer driven trash. It will be hard to forget those brown-eyed, wide-eyed kids smiling and waving, their dads raising their heads momentarily from their piece-work to give us a smile
If it's India it has to be cricket!

On the way to the top
Late Saturday evening, we (My wife & I) decided to go for a trek on Sunday. Rajgad and Visapur were the options. I had already been to Rajgad 3 times. So Visapur it was! I looked up on net for some info. But most of them were long and descriptive blogs. I was looking for specific details. Hence this blog. We trekked and had a lot of fun. We missed a couple of times. But this blog is only about specific details 😊 Maybe I will write a detailed one when I get some time (I have been writing blog on my year long travel for two years now). There are different routes to go to the top. I will only describe the one I took So here goes:

A couple of things before you go ahead:


• We drove to the village at the base (Bhaje).Hence I don't know about public transport. However mostly people get down at Malavali railway station and walk two kms on tar road to Bhaje village.
• We went in February. A lot of things change in Monsoon: It is definitely more beautiful. But it is crowded too. The trails may have gone for
View from the top
a toss (esp the one from Bhaje caves to visapur) with mud and water. However, the trails may be well-marked too. A lot of groups go in monsoon and hence mark them. Caves timing may be differet. There may be more options for eating.


The drive

Pune (Warje) to Bhaje Village:


• Take the bypass and get on to old NH4.
• Take left at Karle exit (it is about 5-6 kms from Kamshet, a very easy to miss turn. It has a small board right before the turn. But easy to miss again. Keep looking)
• Go straight, cross the railway tracks, take left, take the bridge over the expressway and the road will end at the bhaje village.
• There is a parking place at the village. He will charge about 20 (or more-less, depending on his mood)
• It is 60 kms from Warje to Bhaje Village.
• You need to order your lunch if you want it in the noon. You won't get anything otherwise (happened to us!).


The trek till Lohgad Village


• There is straight trail that goes to the twin Visapur-lohgad forts.
• In 10 mins you will get a board for
View from the top
Bhaje caves. You can climb up the steps and at some point just take left and find the zig-zag trail going up to Visapur. But it is very confusing. I won't reccomend.
• The caves have a gate and they caharge tickets. At 8.00 am, the gates were closed. So don't waste time and effort going up the caves (we did!)
• Take the trail near to the steps and go straight ahead.. it is fairly straight-forward .. and in fact a motorable road.. I think within a year it will be a tar road. However, you can take shortcuts and miss most of the road and motor cycles (we did and it was fun!)
• After some time, you will find a tar road (it seems the road connects to lonavla) , that you can't miss. A km on this road will take you to a resort under construction. Here you can take right for Visapur. There are no markings.
• If you are hungry (like we were) you can go a half a km ahead to lohgad village and eat and come back.
• A trail to Lohgad trek goes from here. It is a straightforward steps route and hence we opted for
Window Viewing
the more intersting Vispur.


The trek from Lohgad village to Visapur


• After the left (when you are coming from Bhaje), go on the trail for 15-20 minutes. There will be a hut on your left. Take the left trail.
• Immediately there will be a small waterfall (it was dry in winter) on your left. There may be some markings there. Take the waterfall.
• Do not take the more prominent trail (we did) .. you can go on that trail for quite a long time and reach some village (we almost did).
• Take the waterfall route.
• This is a tricky route with number of small trails branching out. Keep left and take the trails that go up.
• At one point there will be a clearing and you have to climb up from the water fall. It is not difficult (atleast not in winter).
• It will take 30 mins from the turn to Visapur (if you are moderately fit and don't miss the trail)


Visapur


• On the top, its vast. But, it is all open and has some overly sensitive cows..
• There is no drinking water on the top (We were told there would
the view on the other side
be, but we did not find anything besides some cesspools. we ran out of water.)
• Its vast and I have no idea whats there. What we did is take left when you reach the top and follow the wall. It will take you round the fort. The wall on the other side of the fort has some nice views of lonawala, e-way and all. It is fine to spend some good time. Not so much at 12.00 pm though.


Visapur to Bhaje via Bhaje Caves


• There is a shorter route from Visapur to Bhaje caves. It is difficult to find since the top is so vast and there are hardly any runis. Look for the normal chor darwaja kind of features which you will find in other forts. There are proper steps and there is a hanuman carving in stone with some cave-rooms kind of structure. You will have to go down on that trail.
• Remember, the village that you see when you come down is not Bhaje village. You will have to come to a point where you have to take left. this is tricky and depending on your experieince of trekking in sahydris, sense
the trail to bhaje village
of direction and luck, you may find it.
• I am saying this, as we met six guys, who were hoplessly lost, they had started for lohgad and somehow they ended up on the trail to visapur on the other side!!
• The trail is shaded by shrubs, some small trees. nice to walk.
• Keep on walking till you find a cluster of few houses. Ask them how to get to the bhaje caves.
• The ferociously barking, unchained dog won't bite or chase (it did not bite or chase us).
• You will go through endless zig-zags and join somewhere on the steps to bhaje. If you have the enthu you can go up the steps and see the caves. (I did not and my wife had already seen them. Hence we opted for the nimbu paaniwala a few steps down. We were badly dehydrated)
• There was no lunch as we had not ordered. Hence we had to resort to one of those over-priced punjabi dhabhas on the old NH-4. (Seriously i dont know why they are so famous that people come all the way from pune..)


Did not take my camera. Took the photos from wife's mobile phone. She claims they will shame my camera.

In Dharavi
Photo by courtesy of Reality Tours & Travel
When you've visited somewhere quite often, it becomes difficult to find anything very new to say about it, doesn't it?

I've been to the hot and humid city of Mumbai (Bombay) four or five times, most recently in 2009 (Mumbai's extremes) when it was a convenient place to meet my young Rajasthani friend on our way south to Kerala. This time, it was a convenient place to start a tour to the north with my travelling companions, the Grey haired nomads, neither of whom had been here before. They like peaceful, wide open spaces and don't normally do cities, so I think they were a bit overwhelmed by it all. Well, this is one of the most heavily-populated metropolitan areas in the world with over 20.5 Million people crammed into it. To put this into perspective, that's more than the populations of London, Paris, Rome, Madrid, Berlin and Vienna combined!

It's also the commercial capital, a global financial hub and by far the wealthiest city in India. This you'd only realise by looking at some of the modern tower blocks, glass skyscrapers and tall apartment buildings, which loom above cramped and dilapidated dwellings that house the average Mumbaiker. Look out

of any five-star hotel window and you'll see families living in the streets or in makeshift shanty towns. Poor public-health facilities, limited educational opportunities and unemployment are all familiar scenes to the half of this city’s population which lives in a slum dwelling of some sort.

While I'll include some pictures of the touristy things we've seen during our two days here, I'd like to say a bit about a place in central Mumbai called Dharavi. It's a place that most tourists don’t see – or possibly don’t want to believe actually exists. Perhaps they prefer to bury their heads in the sand, thinking that Danny Boyle’s film Slumdog Millionaire was produced in a studio rather than on location.

Dharavi is the second-largest slum in the whole of Asia (it was once the first-largest, but has now been overtaken by Orangi Town in Karachi, Pakistan). Dharavi’s population of over a million live cheek by jowl on about one square mile of land that was once a mangrove swamp. It's right in the middle of the city and that means it's potentially threatened by development. Certainly, government rehousing schemes have been talked about for years but it's likely to
A goat with admirers in Dharavi

be a good few more before they come to anywhere near fruition.

Meantime, I find it to be one of the most inspiring places I've ever been to anywhere in the world and firmly believe all visitors should see it first-hand if they’re to experience a balanced view of life here in Mumbai. Don’t attempt to visit it on your own though – it’s a rabbit warren of alleyways, open drains and tangled power lines. You’ll need to be accompanied by someone who knows their way around. I heartily recommend Reality Tours & Travel . I’ve been with them twice and they do a great job. A hefty percentage of their profits goes – by way of their registered charity Reality Gives - to support community projects in the slum, some of which you’ll be able to see in action. They’ll also combine the slums with a sightseeing tour of the city, if you wish.

You’ll see the increasingly large recycling industry, processing waste from other parts of the city and even some from overseas. Much of it’s plastic in all shapes and forms, from old mineral-water bottles to computer casings, that’s ground into pieces, washed, melted down and coloured ready
Recycling oil cans, Dharavi
Photo by courtesy of Reality Tours & Travel
to be made into something new. There’s also a thriving industry that takes metal cooking oil containers, cleans them inside and out and sprays them with red oxide paint to be reprinted with another brand name and refilled. Cardboard boxes are recycled and small enterprises that might be everyone’s image of sweatshops print fabric or stitch it into garments for the home market. There’s a community of potters making containers for water and cooking pots and you’ll often encounter areas where poppadom (papad) are being dried in the sun over basketware frames. It’s a busy place.

Yes, there are places where open sewers scent the air and rubbish sits in piles waiting never to be collected. Yes, you have to be careful where you put your feet. Yes, there’s a health and safety issue around every corner. However, you’ll see only happy faces - faces that are happy with their lot might be a better expression perhaps. Children making their way to school wear smart uniforms, the girls with their long black hair neatly plaited and tied with matching ribbons. All politely return your ‘hello’ greeting.

Take a look at some of the pictures below –

you can’t take photographs yourself while in the slums (it’s not a tourist site), so these have been kindly supplied by Reality Tours & Travel. Some were taken by children living in Dharavi as part of a photography project run for them by Reality Tours.

If you’re in Mumbai and have half a day to spare, visit Dharavi. It’ll bring new meaning to your understanding of how the other half lives.

Rano holenie a sprcha vo vrelej vode,ta mi fakt bodla,bo v noci je tu riadna kosa. Izba bola uplne nahovno,presvitalo mi dnu svetlo,boli ocut same hlasy,ledvaj som zaspal.

Recepcny este o 8/00 chrapali,musel som ich zobudit aby mi vratili pas,inac by som zdrhol zrejme bez platenia. Recepcny mi dal pas a zistoval ci som vlastne zaplatil izbu a furt studoval papiere,tak som sa priznal a zaplatil,i ked som nad tym vahal.

Na ranajky som si dal 3 samosy,dali mi k nim aj chili papricky. Riadne stiplave, hned po zahryznuti mi vybehli slzy z oci a lapal som po dychu.

Na bus c.125 som cakal neuveritelnych 40 minut. Furt dochadzali ine cisla,poradit nevedel nik ale najviac ma sralo to ich indicke cislovanie.

Pri bus stanici som si vsimol KFC. Nabehol som tam,este len otvarali tak moc ochotny neboli. Dal som si menu s kuratom a hranolkami,chcel som aj zmrzlinu ale tu este nemali.

Na ulici ma furt zastavovali nadhanaci do ubytiek,ktorych je tu kopa a su o dost lacnejsie ako v colabe. Jedneho debila som sa nemohol zbavit,nedal si povedat,ze nemam zaujem. Nieco podobne jak to zasrane detsko z hampi.

Na bus som cakal 20.minut,prekvapenie bolo,ze dosol o 5.minut skorej ako mal odchod. Uplny sok,toto sa mi este nestalo. Cakanie som zabil s mini rozhovorom s predajcom listku v jeho stanku. Velice obdivoval moje raichle. V pohode moslim.

V buse som bol prvy cestujuci,postupne sme zbierali ostatnych spolucestujucich. Po 2 hodinach sme dosli na okraj Bombaju,tu sme stali asi hodinu.Bus bol uz plny. Sedadla boli v pohode,vedla mna sedel ind,teda aby som to upresnil v buse boli len indovia. Turisti zrejme vsetci jazdia vlakmi. Drbnuty vodic aj so sprievodcom furt naberali ludi. Nakonec sa cez ulicku nedalo ani chodit,v sleeperoch bunkach boli az 6 indovia natlaceny. Inak cesta v pohode.

Este ma napadlo co sa mi stalo v ubytku. Do ubytka sa bolo treba dostat vytahom,ten obsluhoval ind.Pri mojej druhej ceste tymto prostriedkom ind naciahol ruku, ja reku ,ze mi ju chce podat,tak som mu podal ruku a podakoval za zvezenie vytahom. Potom ma napadlo,ze ta chamrat chcela sprepitne,hned som si spomenul na sam doma 2,ked kevin dal poslickovy do ruky zuvacku.Dalsie cesty vytahom som bol uz vybaveny zuvackou ale nepouzil som ju,uz viac ruku nenatrcal

Kailasa Temple - Ellora
Maharashtra

Satara

It was a long but not too eventful drive (given driving styles and conditions in India) to Satara, other than a good old fashioned Maharashtran grilling from the police at one of 3 check points we passed - S mainly and C as she was driving. We assume it’s because they saw a woman driving and a Gori at that - opportunity knocks for a lovely bribe?! No such luck as we have all the documents in order.

The roads were not bad especially the main bit from about midway onwards (after the windy bits across the Ghats) where we were on dual carriageways all the way. What is a bit bonkers are the lorries who tend to treat the outside lane as the slow lane so all cars have to weave in and out (undertaking mostly).

We survive the 8 hour drive with 2 short stops and get back to be met by initially Girish, Prajakta and their lively son Soham, now 6 (and nick named “Rowdy Rathore” after an Indian Film Character), then by Anupam (S’s nephew) who has caught the bus here from Pune to meet us all. We
At Ajanta Caves
haven’t seen him for a couple of years and he’s grown and changed a lot! For the better we must add. He’s a student at Uni now doing his 2nd year in B Commerce but has retained the Gajendragadkar family charm and is good company.

We failed to realise that as its Republic Day in India, many shops are closed – including the Alcohol shops (it’s a dry day in India………… aaarghhhhhhhh!) No beers. Just as well S has some Old Monk rum at home and we had brought a very small amount of whisky from Goa – they came to the rescue for the night - after that drive we needed some light refreshments. Unfortunately not having learnt from this we make the same mistake on the 30th which is the anniversary of Ghandi’s Assassination – another dry day and no beers again…………. Damn.

After a lovely Idli meal at Girish’s place we watch some FA cup games and hit the sack.

The next few days are spent in domestic bliss and minimal activity – except for M who has a chesty cough he can’t shake off despite medication in Goa. We don’t even have to
Ajanta Temple
think about food as Prajakta does all the meals (they usually do for K&S anyhow) so apart from heading into town for beer and bread, we while away the time, very happily, chatting, sleeping, doing puzzles & Sudoku (C and K’s favourites), entertaining Soham (S seems to be honorary climbing frame!), washing and ironing, and catching up on organising bits for the next legs of our trip. Less happily, C also ends up paying a big lump of money to the tax man as we have been advised that failure to pay will incur interest even if we have a valid complaint against HMRC (which is an on-going issue).

The food is a culinary exploration – home cooked veg, chaat, and things we haven’t come across elsewhere - spicy tapioca, a different type of kichadi ….. We also get to enjoy some of the fruit from the garden – fortunately they picked the bananas before the monkeys (Langurs) arrived to ransack the place!!

In order to get some exercise we head up to the Fort (5km round trip) for a walk, though only make it half way once as its too tough for a wheezing M. Unfortunately, M’s
All this carved out of a hillside - Ellora
cough is not improving so we see Girish’s Dr for some advice and medication including antibiotics….. We never did get to the top this time. Just as well, as there are reports of a tiger being spotted not far away from the Fort by workers cleaning it up the day before.

Spring is in the air and the cherry blossom and kapok trees are just starting to bloom. For us the temperature is lovely – hot in the day and pleasantly cool at night. Kaka still wears his thermals and woolly hat at night!

We have plans to go to the World Heritage Ajanta & Ellora Caves not far from Aurangabad. S has always been keen to go and is to join us and has convinced Girish & family to come along. They have handled the negotiations on hiring a car and driver + the hotel. Kaka is not coming as he would not enjoy all the walking – besides he’s been there. He also decides against coming to Pune with us as he feels it will be too cold for him. So after a fun time (Fenni fuelled) in Goa, and 4 days at his home we
Ellora
are ready to move on.

Aurangabad via Paithan

It’s up at 4.30 am for an early start. Its farewell to Kaka & Girish’s parents who have just returned from a trip to Gujarat. At 5.30 am all ensconced in a Toyota Tavera people carrier with a “cautious” driver, Abhishek we set off first to Pune to drop off our ruck sacks as we will be back here to stay at S’s aunt Shobha’s home for a few days afterwards.

She looks remarkable having lost 28kg in 2 years being on a strict diet + daily gym for an hour and a half. Wow – we admire her determination especially as she is an awesome cook and can’t eat a lot of the stuff she cooks for us on our return. She rustles up hot coffee and Poha for us before we head for Aurangabad via Paithan.

Paithan

We detour off the main highway to take the slow and bumpy road to visit the Aiknath Temple dedicated to the saint whose remains are in the shrine. Girish and family are keen to visit as it’s a good opportunity for them having come this far.

We
Another top view - K Temple Ellora
mention the “cautious driver”, however, in this case he seems to be almost nervous to overtake or undertake as you do in India. Both M & C avoid looking at him to ensure that back seat driver syndrome (irritation and annoyance) don’t set in. It’s a new experience and discipline for us and we take to anticipating an increase in travel time to any destination by about 50% of the time that it should take. Hey ho!

After brief visit and blessing at the shrine and a look around the surrounding village – a pretty run down and dirty place - we make a quick trip (thanks to all the midges) to see the large dam built near the town – which in part explains why it’s so dusty- then head to see some gardens which have a children’s adventure park – to tire Soham out. Unfortunately, all the rides are closed so all he gets is the simple playground and some rather uninspiring water gardens and then we get back onto the road for our hotel. This part of the country seems like the stories of rural India, dusty, dirty, with very poor people on the breadline eking
C in a Chaitrya - Ajanta
out an existence in small hovels by open drains etc.

Eventually we arrive at Aurangabad at about 7pm. It was the Capital for Aurangzeb, the last Great Mughal Emperor (reign: 1653-1707). The Muslim/Mughal influence is around in what is today a big and bustling city.

We are booked into the Hotel Atithi with roof top restaurant & pool – unfortunately by a fly over, but thankfully next door to a beer selling store! The settling into the place is a bit of a comedy of errors out of Fawlty Towers. S gets a room where he can’t use the front door key (and they are aware of this and quite sanguine about it as they say they will let him in and out using the Master key!), Girish’s family room is not ready despite him having rung them 2 hours before with an ETA. We get away ok. They reluctantly swap S’s room to one someone has just vacated and they proceed to just tidy the bed – no sheet change etc, till prompted to! Customer care obviously not a strong point here. Then one of the TVs doesn’t work and they eventually fix it. One good point
Awesome craftsmanship - Ellora
was that they did provide breakfast and free drinking water as part of the deal.

There’s TV in the room so we watch some of the Women’s (one day format) World Cup Cricket. India get knocked out despite being hosts. There’s plenty of cricket & footy, an India MTV type channel of oldies songs, a Comedy Channel + beers from the shop (with surly service) next door which keep us going after each days travel. Beers – Buds as they have no Kingfisher Premium (or mild as it’s known locally) for Rs 120 each.

The breakfasts deserve a mention – surprisingly it’s not the set English, Continental or Indian option as we had thought. They have a buffet with all the Indian options – idlis, parathas, vadas, Poha etc. in addition to the English toast and eggs with jam etc. as well. So we all pig out a bit – fuel for all that walking is our excuse. The coffee was a bit of a tricky issue – they couldn’t make it hot, and getting black coffee for S was definitely a step (challenge) too far for them ………. It seemed like they had to import it from
Satish, Girish & Family at Ellora
Kenya (the time it took to arrive)! And that on demand and after a few reminders too!!

The other item worthy of note at the hotel is its roof top restaurant which is popular with locals as its packed most nights and the food is pretty good while the prices are surprisingly reasonable. We try various non-veg dishes (Mutton Biryanis, Fish Curry & Mutton, Tikkas) with awesome Methi Aloo while Girish & his family stay with pure Veg and Sohi as he is now known sticks with a plate of chips most nights.

One morning we have the delights of being serenaded very loudly at 7am as we are going for breakfast (due to a planned early start to Ajanta) by a Wedding band that strikes up and makes a real din only to be told by the hotel manager to shut up or move elsewhere as the guests are still asleep. They dutifully go to the front of the Hotel in all their gaudy finery and continue.

The city has its own attractions notably the Monument (Bibi-qa-Maqbara) called the poor man’s Taj as it is and has a Taj Mahal design and is a tomb built
Bhudda statue - Ajanta caves
by Aurangzeb’s son for his mother Rabia-ud-Daurant. The city has its own caves 2 km out but not as splendid we understand like the big draws. In any case we don’t get the opportunity to visit – thanks to the cautious driving of “speedy”.

Worthy of note is that Aurangabad is famous for its Himroo and Silk Sarees and they have factories and shops all over. We resist as C doesn’t plan on wearing a Saree any time soon.

Ellora

We decide to do the Ellora trip first as it’s only 30 kms from Aurangabad to give us an easier day in the car after our long journey from Satara as the trip to Ajanta will be a long day.

We get there in about an hour. After the customary Rs 250 each for C & M - it’s only Rs 10 for the rest. The Ellora site is the best example of Indian Rock Architecture caves chipped out over 5 centuries by generations of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain Monks – mainly Monasteries, Chapels and Temples. The Caves line a 2km long escarpment. There are 34 caves in all; 12 Buddhist (AD 600 – 800),
Lunch with super cook Shobha - Pune
17 Hindu (AD 600 – 900), 5 Jain (AD 800 – 1000).

The grandest is the awesome Kailasa Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva – halfway between a cave and a rock cut temple built by King Krishna 1 of the Rastrakuta dynasty in AD760. It is an engineering marvel executed straight from the head with zero margin for error. It’s quite spectacular and one can’t help marvelling at the vision and craftsmanship of generations of devotees whose painstaking work is preserved and enjoyed even today. No draughtsmen, no CAD systems, sheer precision in communicating an image and design to over 70,000 workers to make it a reality over time. We spend about an hour alone here.

There is the opportunity to get a view from the top perimeter of the cave which gives it a sense of scale and grandeur. The temple covers twice the area of The Parthenon in Athens and is 50% higher. It is really a special place and reasonably well kept having been literally sculptured out of the mountain face and put up with hordes of visitors over centuries.

Hindu cave number 15 is the best of the type – The Das Avatara
Buddha Cave Ajanta
(10 Incarnations of Vishnu) one of the finest in Ellora. The Jain caves may lack the artistic ambition of the others but are exceptionally detailed; Cave 32 is the best (The Indra Sabha or The Assembly Hall of Indra).

As the caves are spread around they allow cars and rickshaws to go to strategic parking areas reducing the need for visitors to trek all day around the caves in the heat. Good planning. The time to enjoy the whole site takes about 3 hours, by which time we’re ready for a beer or two!

On the way back, we visit a few other temples nearby - more notably the Ghrushneshwar dedicated to Shiva (one being one of the 12 holy temples for Hindus to visit in India – men remove their shirts/tops etc & go in for blessings.

We then take a little detour to a small Muslim village called Kuldabad which is famous for Aurangzeb’s simple (by request) Tomb. It is opposite a mosque which is famous for having a cloak worn by The Prophet Mohammed and is displayed to pilgrims each year in April.

We finally get back at about 4.30 pm and have
Another Ellora cave
a room service “lunch” with beers at 5pm!

Ajanta

So it’s up early, for breakfast and the long drive (105kms) to Ajanta. Unfortunately we have a puncture so have to stop for a tyre change. We sail along until Soham decides to be suddenly sick having stuffed his face with Parle G biscuits. We stop to clean up - the culprit, his Mum and the car at the back – thankfully with some water from a kind village lady by the road side. So after another false start we eventually get there at about 11 am.

After the usual entry fees we start the quest to see the 30 Buddhist caves known as the “The Louvre of India”. These 2nd Century BC to 5th Century AD caves are now a World Heritage site. They lost their prominence when the Ellora caves came along and left to ruin and were overgrown and abandoned when they were rediscovered in 1819 by a British hunting party. They line the steep face of a horse shoe shaped rock gorge bordering the Waghore River flowing below. If you don’t fancy the walk and steps to get to the caves, you can pay
Satish at Ellora
Rs 800 to be carried in a Sedan chair supported by 4 locals. We only see Japanese tourists take this option. The caves are walkable.

The caves are renowned for their ancient Frescoes which are pretty badly damaged and have to be seen in dim light to preserve the paintings remaining, and visitors can do with bringing a torch with them. We end up taking 4 or 5 pics of each painting as in poor light it’s hard to see if they will come out ok, and tripods aren’t allowed. The other challenge to contend with is the huge number of school kids on day trips. Like swarms of locusts they rake through the caves but fortunately their schedule is tight so we sit put for a while ‘til they go through.

There are 5 Chaityas (prayer rooms) & 25 Viharas (Buddhist Monasteries) among the caves though many are closed permanently or under reconstruction. We think Ellora is more impressive overall but do end up with some good photos.

Once again in need of a beer after all the walking and viewing we hit the MTDC Resort for lunch – Kangaroo beer (!!?? Never heard of before
Dinner at Mahesh Seafood place - with Yogesh, Indie, Viju & Sadhana - Pune
– it’s Australian), and snacks to see us through to the evening. We also find a Havmor ice cream stand – sheer happiness for C – which sells Bombay Kulfi. Not quite as good as the Chowpatty Kulfi in Gujarat but still yummy.

Daulatabad

On the final day of the trip we go to Daulatabad – not far from the city and this is the surprise package of the lot for us as its Girish’s choice – we hadn’t even heard of it. It’s a 2 moat fort on top of a hill which requires steep steps up and in places dark passages through bat infested caves to get to the top. This is where they used to pour water in and smoke to drown & smoke to death anyone who made it past the first moat. Brownie points all round though as we all make it eventually.

Within the grounds are a minaret, mosques rebuilt as temples, original temples, lookout towers, cannons and an open air museum showcasing the main artefacts. We thought an hour would do it but takes 2 and a half – and not just due to the climb.

As we drive
Hitching a ride - Ajanta
back Soham throws another sickie – but this time Prajakta is prepared with a plastic bag so the collateral damage is minimised!! As we face a long journey back to Pune (and even longer for Girish and family as they go on to Satara) we stop off briefly at a warm (AC not working) Café Coffee Day for coffee and snacks then hit the road again arriving late in Pune at 6-30pm to stay with Satish’s aunt, Shobha, for the next 3 days.

Pune

Girish and his family depart after a brief stop at Shobha’s place after which we and S take to the road to find the local beer shop (Beers Rs 105 each here). We also find the “Hot Chips” shop next door – a den of savoury delights doing a roaring trade in crisps (proper ones - without crinkles for C!), peanuts and all sorts of other snacks we have never seen or heard of before. Dinner is a lovely Kichadi cooked specially for us by Shobha, for which we are very grateful as this is forbidden fruit for her.

Over the next few days we sample some fabulous home cooked lunches –
Caves with some Murals - Ajanta
veg, daal or kadi soups, chapatis – all of which thankfully Shobha can enjoy (she just steers clear of the rice). We also get to try some alphonso mango pulp (made last year as a way of preserving the excess crop) which is just awesome. And a new dish for us – apee – for breakfast, which are little rice flour balls stiffed with onion, chili and spices and cooked in a special griddle. Soooo good!!

S has a quick phone call exchange with Yogesh, who is in town with his wife Indie from his home in Oz. He’s originally from Pune and has known S for many years. We’ve met him a few times in London when he’s been over, and we’re all planning to meet up for dinner the next couple of nights.

We take the opportunity to do a bit of shopping while we’re here. It is certainly a big city, busy & bustling, with significant development everywhere it seems and adverts on TV and the roadside for the many flats for sale (8 lakh to 80 lakhs - £10k to 100k) in large blocks. We like the feel of it though. It doesn’t seem
Satish with his B'day present - Pune
so dirty and traffic congested as other cities and many of the neighbourhoods – such as where Shobha lives – are very pleasant with neighbourhood shops and facilities. The centre of town has all the main high street brands you see in the UK – Nike, Addidas, Sony, Baskins & Robbins!!! But intermingled with traditional chaat stands, fruit sellers and local stalls. We’re on the hunt for shorts but without success, though M does get some new boxers and T shirts (which C will doubtless “borrow”).

Yogesh stays with his sisters, Sadhana and Viju, and we head across to see them in another pleasant neighbourhood, and join Yogesh & Indie for a sunset stroll to a local viewpoint. The sunset isn’t great but it gives an ideal opportunity for a detour to the bottle shop on the way back for some beers and rum!!!

Sadhana and Viju are lovely and good company – and when they hear of our travel plans ahead are determined we should also go to Dharamsala and Manali!!! It sounds enticing but ……

We head out with Indie and Yogesh to Olivia, a restaurant S has recommended. The meal is pretty good though
Ajanta Cave
they seem to be determined to fill us up with snacks while we wait for each course – and even bring some during the meal!!! Next night Viju and Sadhana join us too at Mahesh – recommended by Yogesh. It’s a bit flash but the food is good – it specialises in fish and especially dishes from Mangalore.

As this is our last night with Satish, we take the opportunity to present him with a thank you gift we brought in Haridwar 4 months ago. It’s a T shirt with the slogan “Slogger” and “Cricket. A way of life”. Slogger is S’s nickname and he’s just about the most cricket mad person you could hope to find. We couldn’t resist it even though we thought it may be a bit small!! He seems to appreciate it and even gets it on the next day saying it will give him the incentive to lose a few kilo’s so it fit’s properly.



And so finally we reach the end of our travels with Satish and we head off to Pune station for a 33 hour train journey to Kolkata. We’ve had
Ellora caves
a fantastic time: meeting up with all his family (Anupam called in again while we were in Pune as this is where he lives); enjoyed Girish and family’s and Shobha’s hospitality; had some lovely lazy days chilling with S and Kaka in Goa; and eaten and drunk enough to sink a battleship!! Felt like a real holiday.

Asia » India » Maharashtra » Mumbai » Colaba
February 10th 2013
Published: May 25th 2013


Do Bombaju sme dorazili o 8/00. Na zaciatku mesta bolo vidiet kopa chatrc a chudoby,cim sme isli viac do centra chudoba ustupovala ale bordel nie. Bus ma vyhodil 3km od casti Colaba a 4km od hlavnej zel.stanici.

Vybral som sa pesibusom do casti colaba. Na chodnikoch sa prave umyvali indovia,ovsem nie vsetci,niektory uz ranajkovali resp este spali vo svojich pribytkoch. Na hlavnej ulici o murovane oplotenie uchytena plachta,z bokov drevenne desky a to bol ich domov. Uplna hroza. Niektory spali len tak na ulici ,len zabaleny do oblecenia. Fakt takyto bordel a chudobu som este nevidel. Nachadza sa tu aj jeden z najvacsich slumov na svete,kde robia cestovky vylety,veru tam sa nechystam kuknut.

Len tak zo srandy som behol zisiti ubytko v hoteli,cena 3200rup,potom uz nasledovali jednoduhsie ubytka 800rup,dorm 250 rup ale bol full,dasli opat za 250 a opat full,tak som nakoniec skoncil v mega drahom ubytku za 450 rup, zjednavat v ziadnom ubytku nechceli. Tim padom tu ostavam len jednu noc. Delight GH mi dohodil predavac pohladnic,mozno ak by som siel bez neho tak by som dostal lepsiu cenu.

Po ubytku som siel omrknut India gate a hned som si aj rozmyslel vylet na elephant island,ked som zbadal tie kopy ludi co tam prudia.

Od gate som siel na mumbai central kupit listok na zajtra do udaipuru. MHD som chytil az na druhy krat,bo chujovci maju normlane cisla napisane vzadu, vpredu maju vypisane len po indicky. Sprievodca mi povedal kedy mam vystupit,trocha dezorientacie.

Cez zel.stanicu som siel na bus stanicu. Pri listkoch na zel.stanici som cakal kopu ludi ako o tom kazdy hovori ale bolo ich pri okienku tak 15.A ani na peronoch icj nebolo kvanta. Cestou este ked sme rano vchadzali do mesta,tak som si vsimol vagony,dobytcaki,zrejme miestna mhd,normalne len nakladne vozne a v nich indovia.

No na vladnej bus stanici som opat nepochodil,jeden bus mal ist zajtra o 16/00 ale cenu mi povedat nevedeli,tak som siel k dalsiemu okienku a tam uz o tomto buse vobec nevedeli. Vybral som sa teda opat na sukromnu linku,stacilo prejst cez cestu od bus stanice a tam bola kopa stankov. V prvom mi ponukal za 600rup, tak reku overim dalsie stanky a vratim sa sem,hned ako som sa zvrtol okamzite chlapik zlavil na 400rup. Berem to,klasicky kombi bus sedenie/sleeper bez klimatizacie odchod o 11/00. Bolo 10/45 vraj si mam pockat a omrknut bus ak sa mi nebude pacit vrati mi prachy. Bus rovnaky ako z goa do bombaju len ina spolocnost. Zajtra ma caka 20 hodinovy presun.

Nazad som odchytil opat mhd c.124,cul som platil o 3 rup viac. Nakoniec som si to rozmyslel a vystupil na skorsej zastavke pri muzeu. Na ulici tu bola vystava umenia,clovek musel prejst cez pipac kovov ,potom prehliadka od policie/vojakov a uz bol v areali. Boli tu rozne vytvori z papiera a inych materialov.

Odtialto som siel do muzea. Vstup pre cudzincov 250rup,studenti za 25rup, thajska ISIC zabrala. Muzeum je fakt velke,prave tu bola aj doplnkova vystava egypt. Odporucam muzeum navstivit ale len za tich 25rup. Vnutri kopa ludi,kazdu polhodinku tu premietali aj daky 3d film ale stat v rade sa mi nechcelo.

Z muzea som sa pobral dalej omrknut mesto,zbadal som mcdonald,tak reku skusim indickeho ako chuti,uplna hroza aj zmrzlina bola horsia. Som si dal volaky maharadzov burger ,ble.

Po jedle som si siel odpocinut do kopky,nevedel som najst ubytko,pocestny mi ponukali hasis a marisku.

Po sprche a mini spanku,asi len 45.min som siel pokracovat v prehliadke mesta. Nasledoval som mapku z LP,vacsinu veci som uz videl z busu. Vacsina budov je tu z obdobia britskej okupacie,fakt mega velke a pekne budovy. Pristavil som sa pri miestnom parku,strasne velky oval kde asi 98 percent ludi hralo kriket. parky v indii su zvacsa len suche miesta bez zelene a bez tiena.

V cross maidan garden,naznaky travy,bolo dake vystupenie. Male deti v krojoch na podiu tancovali,spievali,fajn kulturna vlozka. Jasne,ze do tohto parku bolo treba prejst cez nefungujuce pipace a samozrejme bolo treba podstupit prehliadku od policajtov.

Po kulturnom vyziti som siel k vode. Presiel som sa nabrezim,ktore bolo lemovane kopou ludi,sedeli na hradzi a bavili sa. Viditelnost bola na prt, smog, takze zapad slnka sa nekonal.

V tme som trosku zabludil,ocitol som sa na mieste s kolotocmi. Okostoval som kukuricu robenu na uhlikoch,ktoru mi potreli niecim stiplavym.Fajn jedlo. Vsetky kolotoce co tu boli pohanali indovia rucne,dalej sa tu deti mohli vozit na konoch,maly ind vysadol na kona a obsluha zobrala kona a utekala s nim po vymedzenom priestore. Potom sa tu maly indovia mohli dat povozit na auticku. Opat sadli do auticka a obsluha ich tlacila po parkovisku. Pod obsluhou si treba predstavit starych indov resp male deti. Dobre sa namakali teda.

Po tejto sou som sa zazrakom vymotal z bludiska smradalvych uliciek,zobrajucich indov a prisiel uz k znamym zachytnim bodom. V jednom vyklade som zbadal paradne sachy, po prieskume zistene, ze stoja 8500rupii som si kupu rozmyslel. Obchodnik ma nechcel pustit zo svojho kralovstva,hned mi zacal ponukat kasmirove satky a rozny iny material,som sa rychlo teda odtial pakoval.

Opat som zakotvil v mcdonalde,som sa nepoucil,a opat len vegetariansky blivajz. Vnutri v restike nenormalny bordel,drbkovia si po sebe ani tacky neodpratavaju (to asi robia ludia len na svk). Nabuduce uz len KFC,tam je istota masa.Uz som prejedeny roznych placiek,samos a ineho poulicneho jedla.

Z jedla opat bludenie ale nakoniec som to opat nasiel. Sa tu dako nemozem zorientovat.

V ubytku mi este nevratili pas ale zas som im este nezaplatil.

Indovia su tusim viac pritepleny nez thajci,priliehave oblecenie,vlasy nafarbene na hnedo,drzia sa za ruku,furt sa objimaju,no grc.

Zajtra rano v plane,sprcha,konecne oholenie,samosa s cili paprickami a sup na mhd,z tohto hovno ubytka vypadnem o 9/00,tak dve hodiny mam na presun. Musim dokupit vodu a volake keksi na cestu.

Zacal mi blbnut mobilny signal,stale mi vypadava.

Som fakt zvedavy na udaipur,podla vacsiny cestopisov to ma byt romanticke,pohodove mesto.Ale moc tomu neverim,bo zatial pravu tvar indie ma popisanu len markoff,ostatny nevim ci navolacom ficia ked pisu cestopisy alebo fakt nevim,mozno chodim do zlych stvrti alebo co.

'A Package to India'

12th February 2013

It was 1956 and I was home on leave from the Air Force for the week-end. An Indian gentleman knocked on our front door that day, enquiring after my 1939 Hillman advertised for sale in the local paper. I had never met an Indian gentleman before. The Doctor didn’t haggle. We exchanged £100 cash for a hand-painted black Hillman Minx with dodgy cable brakes, rust holes plugged with fibreglass and a dicky head-gasket.

A few years later my father sold our suburban semi-detached in Wembley, to the west of London, to yet another Indian, another Doctor - and moved to Norfolk, leaving behind a burgeoning Indian society.

As I now tread the featureless aisles of London’s Heathrow Airport with Janice and my younger brother Mike, I sense a passing, backwards through the mirror, watching the Olde England I once knew as my home fade into the distance in ever diminishing shades of grey as I depart for another, more colourful, world.

The grey haired nomads are heading for India. And Mike, (aka keep smiling) a knowledgeable lover of all things Indian, will be our guide. He is largely responsible for our itinerary and our packing list:


A Package to India



We shall land in Mumbai on the Arabian Sea to the thud of a humid blanket
A parachute jump in a steam-filled bath, the pulsing heart of an eight-armed goddess
A deodorant-stick and sun-tan lotion, a few short-sleeved shirts and light cotton undies
This Gateway to India, the heaving throngs, the Raj of the past and the poor and the present
The Muslim, Hindu, the Buddhist and Christian, the Islam, the Jain and followers of Sikhism
A hat for Sikh Temples, string belt for the Jain - and top of the list, a sun-hat for Sundays

The Marble palaces of Udaipur, sparkling lakes and time to discover the old walled city
The Mughal emperors and Vishnu temples, an Indian wedding - now what should I wear?
A jacket or jumper perhaps that would do, a shirt with a tie and a clean pair of shoes
Eat with the right hand and cleanse with the left, raise them together in silent greeting
The Adinath temple in Ranakpur, a meeting with friends at the Kumbalgarh Fort
Take cameras and lenses and memory cards, the laptop and charger to bring in the news

The Thar Desert’s shifting sands, forts and bazaars, and henna art for ladies’ hands
A night in a homestay in old Jodhpur and a cookery lesson tonight for sure
A first-aid kit might not go amiss - a plug for the sink, and for music, the iPod
Marble Palaces, blue-washed houses, herbs and puppets and sweets and spices
Then off to Nagaur for the Cattle Fair, camels and cows, the donkeys and flies!
Malaria tablets to be perfectly safe, take an Alarm clock - and remember the tripod

To the pink-city of grand Jaipur, the Amber Fort with an elephant ride
Things astronomical, the Jantar Mantar, the sun and the stars all viewed from afar
Hotel with a pool so remember the trunks, a notebook and pencil, a clothes-line for washing
This capital city of Rajasthan, the ‘Palace of Winds’ the grand City Palace
The Jaigarh Fort and Galtaji Temple - The Monkey Temple, (The Galwar Bagh)
Lotion for suntan, a poncho and floss, the list of good restaurants for drinking and noshing

The roar of the tiger at Ranthambore, the langur the leopard, the jackal and boar
The chill morning air, the afternoon heat, from sunrise to sundown the challenge is set
Warm gloves and a scarf would not go amiss, a poncho, thick socks and binoculars too
Keoladeo’s a must for the birds and the beasties; the ibis and cranes to name but a few
A jeep to see wildlife at Chambal Reserve, the python, the croc, the wolf and the mongoose
Tee-shirts and spare trousers, boots for the hike, flip-flops for temples (and also the loo)

That Agra moment, the Taj Mahal, the classical dancing the mystical music
The tagiyah, the turban (the pagri or safa), the dazzling Saris and Sawar-kameez
Pyjamas for homestays and the loo in the night, a torch would be good to give us some light
Holy cows and lunatic traffic, buses and rickshaws and camels and trains
The Shiva the Vishnu and even the Devi, the four-headed Brahma, and ancient legends
Remember spare glasses and Mobile-phones, and addresses for cards to post overnight

Beware Delhi-belly, or so I’ve been told, for Delhi will lure you, both New and the Old
Chicken bhuna and peshawari nan, vindaloo and tandoori to swallow
Eat with the locals, diarrhoea tomorrow, Immodium-Plus, loo paper to follow)
The melange of buses, rickshaws and cars, three-wheeler ‘tuk-tuks’ and Holy cows
This Capital City, of slums and shanties, shadows of Lutyens, the Raj and high-rises
Anti-bacterials for cleansing the hands and an opener for bottles - I’ve one you can borrow

Trains will transport us from Delhi to Shimla, that summer land to the Raj and to Kipling
Into the foothills of the great Himalayas, snow on the mountains of Himachal Pradesh
A blow-up cushion for the narrow gauge railway and add an umbrella, in case it rains
The spices and cow dung will tingle the nostrils, colourful costumes will dazzle the eyes
Encounters with con-men will often abound, wodges of Rupees exchanged for our Pounds
Remember a money-belt for cards and for cash, spare wallet for coins and tickets for trains

Up in the hills at Dharamsala, the Buddha, Tibetans, and the Dalai Lama
Monasteries, monks and red-robed nuns, The Mall, the Bazaar and the Vice Regal Lodge
A bottle for water, a razor and foam, toothbrush and toothpaste and add a spare comb
Then on to Amritsar and the Golden Temple, the Sikh community’s holiest shrine
A side-trip to Wagah to witness the sham astride the border with Pakistan
The laptop for blogging, I nearly forgot, and then via Delhi, we’ll soon be back home!



_____________________________________________________________________________________

Passport copied and Visa stamped, eye-shade and ear-plugs, a good book to read .................

Jet Airways Flight 9W117 - ‘Stand-by for take-off!'



Join us as we begin our 35 day journey north, from Mumbai to Dharamsala and Amritsar.

And may Ganesh go with us.


For my little brother, Mike's, take on our five-weeks in India, go to: Keep Smiling

Our taxi from the airport
We made it to India! After a four hour flight, we touched down in Mumbai at around 5:00 p.m. on January 24th. Getting through customs was hassle free, although we found out that India requires you to provide a significantly greater amount of detail about your stay than the other countries we’ve visited. Baggage claim was a rather chaotic introduction to the “every man for himself” attitude that many Indians possess when it comes to waiting in lines. Even before there were any bags on the conveyor belt, everyone was pushing and shoving to get a good spot. When our bags finally came around, we had to fight our way to the inside just to grab them! When we had our things and were ready to go, we hired a prepaid taxi, which we’d been recommended to do since it’s the cheaper option. Unfortunately, our driver didn’t speak English and couldn’t figure out the way to Scott’s cousin Tara’s apartment (she lives in Mumbai and was kind enough to share her apartment with us for a few days) AND it was rush hour, which was insane. It ended up taking us almost two hours to get there after our driver stopped
One of those crazy kites!
for directions twice. We made it eventually, though!

We spent our first night hanging out with Tara and her friends, and she had some amazing Indian food delivered – I officially want to live somewhere where authentic, delicious Indian food can be brought to my doorstep. Than again, that may not be a wonderful idea… Anyway, we slept in the next morning, then ventured out to get some bagels at a shop near the apartment. We spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing and planning our travels through India. We also passed the time by watching the crazy kites (a type of raptor) swoop dangerously close to Tara’s 12th story window. Sometimes they would sit on the windowsill and stare you down…freaky. For dinner, we walked along the Pali Hill promenade, a seaside walkway in Tara’s neighborhood in Bandra West, until we reached some street food stands. There we ordered some momo’s, which are veggie/meat filled steamed dumplings, and a masala dosa, basically a giant crispy crepe filled with potatoes and spices. We finished our meal with some frozen yogurt – something I’ve been missing greatly for the past few months!

After a few days in Bandra West,
Some locals by the water
enjoying the quiet neighborhood atmosphere, we moved on to Colaba, the tourist district where much of Mumbai’s sightseeing is located. We happened to be there on Republic Day, so there were tons of people on the Causeway where most of the street vendors set up shop. We booked three nights in the Sea Shore Guesthouse, located right near the famous Gateway to India monument with a fantastic view of the Arabian Sea. We had a nice big corner room that was a little dingy, but not too bad. We made the mistake of sending out some of our laundry to be washed, though, which turned out to be a bit of a fiasco. Whoever washed our clothes drew black lines inside of them with permanent marker, supposedly as a way to distinguish them from other people’s laundry, but we weren’t a huge fan of this system. When we complained and asked for our money back, the staff were defensive, rude and unaccommodating. You win some, you lose some I guess.

On a more positive note, we saw some very interesting sights during our few days in Colaba. We visited the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya Museum, formerly the Prince
The top of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel at night
of Wales Museum of Western India, which contained a variety of Indian artwork, as well as many religious and historical items. We also ate at a few awesome vegetarian places where I tried thalis and authentic masala tea (chai). For my birthday lunch, we ate at an Iranian restaurant, where a nice old man who worked there told us that we were “a good boy and girl together” and asked us to send his regards to Mrs. Hillary Clinton. We spent the rest of my birthday going to see Life of Pi in 3D, buying tickets to Goa at the hot, noisy and inefficient train station, getting stopped on the sidewalk and asked if we’d like to be in a Bollywood film (to which Scott sadly said no), and going to dinner at a fancy place called Trishna, where we ate amazing king crab legs covered in butter, garlic and pepper along with some paneer tawa and naan – yum! We topped it off with some fro yo for dessert, then hung out at Starbucks for awhile, where the barista joked with me in Marathi (I still have no idea what he said) and Scott took advantage of the free
The equivalent of a carriage ride in Charleston :)
wi-fi. All in all, it was a pretty sweet birthday. J Scott even bought me two nice pashmina scarves as a birthday present.

The next day, our last in Mumbai, we met up with Tara for lunch at a nice fusion restaurant where we had the most interesting and delicious boneless chicken wings EVER – they were chopped up and shaped into cubes, then fried and served with an amazing sauce…so good! We also had an array of other yummy tapas, and Tara kindly treated us! After lunch, we walked to the Gateway to India arch, where, surprisingly, I was bombarded by people who, for some reason, wanted to have their pictures taken with me. I thought maybe they mistook me for a celebrity, but Tara informed me that they were just from small villages and had never seen white people before. It was a bit strange but fun, and now I know how celebrities feel! We said goodbye to Tara and headed back to the hotel where I gave Scott a haircut – yes, ME, and I did a pretty awesome job for my first haircut ever, if I do say so myself! Afterward, we got some dinner,
The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya Museum - say that five times fast!
packed and prepared to wake up early for our 6:55 a.m. train to Arambol Beach in Goa.

I absolutely love this country so far – the food, the culture, the people, and even the misadventures (which you’ll hear more about soon! I’m a bit behind in my blogging…). I’m looking forward to see what India has in store for us. I’m sure it will be amazing!

''holi face''
I am not a traveler who always want to travel alone. I would like to travel with the people who have same kind of tastes like me. I have some experiences for that.. my traveling experiences started from 2010 december. I had many visits in different states before but none of them were exclusively for traveling. At that time I came to Mumbai with one of my friend who have the same feeling of understanding a city life. I would rather like to walk around tha city than going in Taxi or Tuk TUk. On the way we found many people who are really ineteresting and memorable.



I have visited mumbai sevaral times but most memorable is for the holi. I never have thismuch colors in my dress and mind. Fist we went in a hotel to celebrate holi with color water and colorful food but after we began to walk with a bottle of rum. I found this way of celebrating holi with simple people more interesting than dancing like in a pub.



After we found some amazing amazing graffitties on the road near Colaba. It was matching perfectly with the color of holi.


no other way to smile ....

After the celebrations we thinked about the local foods available in Mumbai. We ate lot of puries that is not available in hush bush hotels.



We also explored the affection of people who are staying near masjid. Different kinds of food like bheja fry are mouth watering..



Story of Dabbawalas



A dabbawala or dabbawallah literally meaning ""box person"", or a person in India, most commonly found in the city of Mumbai, who is employed in a unique service industry whose primary business is collecting freshly cooked food in lunch boxes from the residences of the office workers (mostly in the suburbs), delivering it to their respective workplaces and returning the empty boxes back to the customer's residence by using various modes of transport.



''Tiffin'' is an old-fashioned English word for a light lunch or afternoon snack, and sometimes, by extension, for the box it is carried in. For this reason, the dabbawalas are sometimes called Tiffin Wallahs.



Our Story of Hotel Rooms..



As we are from two coutries, we found many difficulties to find rooms in Mumbai. Once we booked a room but he rejected the booking when
families who celebrated with us ,...
he saw us. It was too difficult for us when theyare trying to raise the price for that reason. They all saying the same reason that it will a problem. One hotel guy told me that we are Indians usually trying to cheat and there was sevaral examples in Mumbai. What a nice reason !! Finally we took two double room and stayed in one room.


the best one hotel according to the price and location that we experienced was Hotel Proserrs near TAJ Hotel Colaba. Dont be afraid, its a normal budget hotel 😊



something about walking in the streets



It is very good walk in the street by night with our loved ones. But In India its too difficult because of ''moral policing''. Kind of harrasement by local peoples. We were so happy that the people we met never made any problems and they were very good. but be very careful of that !



Elephenta Caves



If you visited Ajanta and Ellora, then you dont need to visit this !! or may be you can visit just for finishing the ''pride of world'' shown in Archiological Survey of
Holi hangover
we found him near Colaba. .. maybe he doesn't get why people trying to change his colors !!
India Cards. Nothing but suits for different kind of atmosphre. You can try that petit Train those who never did it in Dehradoon, Kalka or in Ooty. just an Island.


Do you need a walk ?



Mostof the guys tried walking on the way that Loanly Planet already marked but have you ever tried on walking in the small streets. If you wish you can choose streets near the Masjid and street near Mumba Devi Temple. This will make you a nice experience those who want to try really local foods.



The things which I hate in Mumbai



First thing I hate in Mumai as I already said ""Sorry sir no Indian and foreigner allowed in one room""



OFcourse ''sir maam Riksha Riksha Taxi Taxi''



and the final thing is the main one. One day I went for walking and found a ad showing ''Slum Tour - Dharavi, the Biggest slum in Asia'' Please never encourage this tour by participating yourself. I am quite sure that ''there dharavi is entirely different than the reality and never offer money for pencils, books for kids. Do it in a proper

it was nice to watch different kind of people and their actions. Taking photos, looking and staring each other bargaining with sellers... a full time killer ....

By the way could say Mumbai is the one of the place you must in India. City (Colaba) will explain how India can be develop in near future. see you !

A Couple Finds Some Space
Couples desperate for a few unsupervised moments alone line up like linked sausages to neck on the beach. All India STD refers not to a rampant venereal disease, but rather a place to make phone calls. Fights are fought with pointed fingers, not closed fists. The unmistakable whistle that signals a dance party… Tweeeeeeeet! Tweettweettweettweet! Tweeeeeeet! That all parties are dance parties. This is there also, hnnnh?

Salwar kameez worn with tennis shoes for an evening walk. Shiny polyester pants, ironed with a sharp crease down the center, worn as casual daywear. Handkerchiefs wrapped around shirt collars to protect them from sweat stains. Fabric billowing around bodies that have jumped fully-clothed into the sea. Mullets have not yet passed out of style.

A cow, a dog, and a rat sharing dinner out of the same garbage bag. Disposable clay cups and banana leaf plates. Barfi – a delectable desert with an unappetizing name. That sweets are served before and after a meal. A milkman delivers milk to your doorstep on his bicycle. A family of five packed together on a single motorcycle for a Sunday outing. Driving as if running someone over will do absolutely no harm. The autorickshaw.
Sunset, Marve Beach


Spray hoses in bathrooms. Ear canals excavated with matchsticks. Teeth brushed until white froth drips off chins. Himalaya Herbals, which makes every possible bath and beauty product from natural ingredients – with the exception of deodorant. An inborn ingenuity and resourcefulness that can find 101 uses for bubble wrap.

The swastika maintains its original message of goodness. Stores display their Timings. Grim-faced, deer-eyed candidates on political posters. A billboard that reads, “The richest Indians share their secret mantras.” A bumper sticker that pleads, “Lord Jesus Have Marcy On Me!” The lack of a sense of entitlement.

This country, this city has become a part of my being. Knowing that it will carry on in my absence – that new people will wash up on its shores to love it, to hate it, to find inspiration in its madness – brings me inexplicable joy. Mumbai meera jain. I will be back.

One of the daunting things about going to a new country must surely be leaving all your friends and family behind. You're a stranger in a strange land and you have to start from scratch, hoping that your work colleagues and the people you meet there will accept you, foibles and all. I was lucky with my first trip to India as the friends I made in Mumbai will definitely be friends for life ... and I wanted to introduce some of them to you. In ten days I head out there again, to meet up with old friends and to work with a brand new Star Team. I can't wait!

Where's Waldo?
People often ask me, “What’s the most important lesson you’ve learned in all your travels?” My answer has always been, “To let go.” With each delayed bus, traffic jam, and unexpected detour; with each new language, new cuisine, new religious custom, I’ve learned to let go a little more. Be it a stolen truck, a broken heart, or a cozy comfort zone, I’ve let them all go (some with more tears than others). But, until I started dancing salsa, I didn’t realize that I’ve never fully let go of my control.

Although I’ve never technically learned even the basic salsa step, following the beat has never been a problem for me. It’s following the lead that gives me issue. If I haven’t said it enough already, I like to do things my own way. And dancing is no different. When I first started dancing, my dance partners frequently complained, “Are you leading, or am I?”

Salsa requires a complete surrendering of control, a complete surrendering of the self. When I come onto the dance floor – thoughts of how I look or expectations about the next step – is when toes get stepped on and faces get elbowed. When
Salsa Masquerade Party
I disappear, there is only the dance.

So, what is the most important lesson I’ve learned while traveling? Let go. Just dance.



For all the travelers out there that love to dance salsa, Bombay has the best salsa scene of any metropolis I've ever been to. You should definitely check it out. Happy dancing! :D

Gateway of India
I love everything about traveling – even the inevitable aches that arise from long, uncomfortable bus trips and missing home. I’ll travel until I’m old and gray, but I make a horrible tourist. I don’t use a travel guide, I don’t snap pictures of myself in front of iconic landmarks, and I never buy souvenirs. To put it bluntly, I don’t need neat tick marks on a “Must-Do” list, digitalized memories, or a bag stuffed with knickknacks to prove that I went somewhere, that I did something.

In all honesty, I don’t much like to do anything. I’m perfectly happy to just be – to walk down random streets and talk to strangers, to eat street food against the advice of others (and better judgment), to never know what or where the next day will bring me. But, every once and a while, I get overwhelmed by what I call my guilty tourist complex. It’s a feeling that I have to do Must-Do things when, really, just thinking about them makes me tired.

I must be the only person who’s ever been to Rome without visiting the Pantheon. Granted, my time there was short, but come on, it’s the
Magda

Pantheon. Recently, I’ve had nothing but time, but what have I done? In over two months in Bombay, I’ve only quickly passed through the Gateway of India and taken a fast, determined stroll along Colaba Causeway – just to say I did it. I’ve driven down Marine Drive several times, but I’ve never stopped to visit Haji Ali, or dip my toes in the water at Chowpatty Beach. And I’ve never been to Elephanta Island. Does this mean that I’ve never been to Bombay?

It’s a revitalizing breath of fresh air to meet people who understand this conundrum, this guilty tourist complex. Enter Magda into my life. We were born two years (two months, two days) and 4,490 miles apart, but I have a sneaking suspicion we were separated at birth. It’s uncanny, the amount of similarities between us. Needless to say, we share the same passion for traveling and have the same reservations about being mistaken for tourists. It seemed only right that, together, we become tourists for a day.

Armed with charged camera batteries, full water bottles, and over-priced tourist tickets, we hopped aboard a ferry to Elephanta Island. No sooner had we sat down than
Beware of Monkey's
and bad grammar!
the rest of the passengers lined up to snap their photo with the white aliens. And we happily obliged. We reveled in our stereotype as tourists, fashioning turbans out of our shawls to protect our heads from the sun. We clicked, clicked, clicked photos of ancient rock carvings and errant monkeys. I even bought a postcard. We came, we saw, we conquered. Then, we left.

Walking back towards the ferry, my day as a tourist almost at an end, I again felt guilty. I had no desire to share my experience. With a melancholic tone, I told Magda, “I won’t write about this.” “Why would you?” she replied understandingly, “This has nothing to do with traveling.”

So what is traveling? And why do we do it?

As far as I see it, traveling entails an intensified search for something we don’t encounter in our everyday lives. It allows us to take a break from the selves defined by our surroundings (our families, our jobs, our houses, our trinkets) and gives us the freedom to be who we really are. For people condescendingly coined tourists, a brief detachment is enough. It’s enough to go on vacation to see
Happy Tourist
Posing with the Trimurti.
the Eiffel Tower, the Sphinx, the Taj Mahal, and then go home. It doesn’t require a person to change. For other people, donning a backpack and shedding all other definitions, creates a whole new definition – that of a traveler. For travelers, change is inevitable. We travel to find inspiration, to find ourselves.

Tourists and travelers are alike in that we all set out seeking the new and extraordinary. The only difference (besides a fridge full of kitschy magnets) is that after traveling long enough, one eventually discovers that we’re all old and ordinary – and that is a very beautiful thing.

Tia at the airport with Passion
After two 9.5 hour flights and an 6 hour layover that turned into 8 hours we finally arrived in Mumbai. We were greeted by crowds of travelers and a sea of traffic upon exiting the airport. In 2007, I stayed with the Sohoni family and when they found out I was coming back to India they were kind enough to welcome us in their home once again. With the time change we only had 3 days in Mumbai to get in the interviews needed before leaving to work with the younger girls in Banaglore.

India has always been a bit of a magical place for me and a place of contrast contradiction. It's overwhelming yet peaceful, it's beautiful yet dirty, modern and yet ancient; so I was excited to come back again. This time with a bit more of a mission of meeting some extraordinary young women who are making a different in the world of gender inequality than a traveler exploring. And having with an amazing little team of talents women the adventure has been much different.

Our first interviewee didnt quite work out because of timing and scheduling but the other two were amazing. Tia found an

One of our semi irritated drivers
organization called Point of View which does some very interesting work around women's sexual safety, healthy, and other areas of empowerment. We first met with a beautiful young women named Nidhi. When she was 15 she was told she had a degenerative eye disease and she would lose her eye sight. Through her trials and tribulations and with family support she was the first blind women to graduate with a degree from university and at 27 is now an advocate for people with sight impairments. When you see the footage of Nidhi you will be blown away at her determination, her infectious laughter and her insistent nature to live a full life. We spent a whole day with her friends and her family, who welcomed us with open arms into their home. Did I mention that Nidhi is also a salsa dancer?

Next we interviewed Zulfiya. At 25, this beautiful, independent, modern muslim woman has a Masters in the Arts, lives on her own in a big city, while her family lives over 12 hours away, and works teaching rural women how to use technology and become better journalists in their own communities. I was in awe of Zulfiyas
Driving Chaos
ability and passion to support young women and women to utilize their unconventional career choices and empower them to become stronger and freer from the constraints of traditional roles that women have had and ""should"" play.

As you can see there hasn't been any room for jetlag and although the Muslim prayers at 5am on the megaphone were beautiful to listen to, we haven't had much sleep in the last 5 days. It was so incredible to be at the the Sohoni's. They were so kind to feed us, drive us when they could, and give the three of us (+ Passion monkey) a beautiful small room to share while in Mumbai. Even Grandma at 94 insisted on cooking for us and making sure we were comfortable when we were downloading footage and working in their home. As a thank you Tia brought some chocolates from California and I brought the all Canadian maple syrup and pancake mix ( for some reason it's a big hit while traveling overseas I've found, go figure!)

We left Mumbai yesterday at 7am and headed to the airport for Bangalore. There was a confusion with Tia's flight which we all missed (Tia's
The Beach with Nidhi and friends
flight was the same time as ours but a different carrier according to the paperwork) So she ran to the other terminal that her carrier was at only to find out they had changed it to our carrier. Poor woman had to run all the way back only to almost miss the flight. Thank goodness it all worked out. Other than this the only other thing about our experience in Mumbai that was challenging was that many people think they know where things are but don't, so we spend alot of time getting lost. Thank goodness we can find humour in just about anything.

The taxi from the airport took over an hour to reach our service apartment (aka 2 rooms in a shared apartment) which my Indian family was so kind to help us take care of. It's simple, clean, save, and close to where we are going every day.

Last night we met with Brinda, the woman who started the organization which we will be working with for the next 11 days. We were all unbelievably moved, inspired, and in awe of her. She is a dynamic, powerhouse of a woman and we decided that not
Monkey filmin
only will we run the group with the 22 girls she has organized to work with us (who are between 11-17 years of age) but we will also be interviewing her, her team, and she will organize one of the women's meetings she facilitates each month. The women in the slum meet each month (normally at the beginning of the month) to get together to talk about issues in the slum and create proactive solutions to their situation. Tia and I learnt right away that Brinda is a natural coach. She empowers the women to make healthier choices that are supported by each other especially around domestic abuse. Brinda says at least 1 women dies each month in this slum alone from domestic violence and she is determined to stop it.

Today we are going to meet the girls we are going to work with and begin what I hope to be a transformation experience for them and what I know will be a unbelievable transformational experience for us.

India just keeps getting better and better.

Traffic
Somehow, I always end up flagging down the slowest rickshaw in Bombay. I’m usually never in a rush to get anywhere; more than happy to arrive whenever I arrive, I leisurely sit back in my sedate transport and bathe in the fumes of all the other autos whizzing past me. But, sometimes, on my way to go dancing, when every minute spent putt-putting down the road could be a minute spent on the dance floor, I’ll wish that my chariot had a little more horsepower. We’ve all heard the warning before – be careful what you wish for, you just might get it!

It was a Sunday afternoon when my wish finally made it through all the red tape, landed on the desk of the wish granter, and got signed into action. I was going home to Marve from a friend’s house in Andheri. Although the two sites are situated only ten kilometers from each other, the journey between them takes at least 45 minutes, and up to an hour and a half, depending on traffic. Even though I didn’t particularly need it that day, I got my fast rickshaw. And I got home in 20 minutes.

I had hardly sat down on the laminated bench in the back, before the auto lurched into full gear, almost plowing into the car ahead of us. The driver sent forth a series of honks, as if the sound waves would make the car blocking our path instantly disappear, clearing the road in front of us. Honking is a form of expression in India and my driver was truly an artiste. He had even installed a top-end instrument of his craft into his machine of work. Every time we rushed towards an upcoming bumper, he’d lean over, flip a switch hidden under the dash, smash his thumb into the horn, and a new, even more obnoxious toot would be hurled like an insult at any who stood in our way. BaLOObaboo BaLOObaboo!PAWpumPOMpaw PAWpumPOMpaw! TWEEdeeedeee DEETWEEdeeedeee!

The driver must have truly believed in the magical vanishing powers of his horn, because we continued to race full speed into pedestrians, bicycles, buses and cars, never slowing down until the last possible second, when our obstacles failed to disintegrate. Then, right at the moment before impact, he’d slam on the brakes. Hardly hindered by the sudden loss of momentum, he’d negotiate around these nuisances and off we’d go again. I let myself go loose, determined to enjoy what I thought would be the last ride of this life.

At his next horn blast, the driver caught sight of me laughing in the rearview mirror, my giggles encouraged him to put on a better show. The horn changes became more frequent, the speed more reckless, the braking more instantaneous – with me laughing like an idiot in the back all the while. I was shocked to arrive at home in such a short time, and without a scratch. Yet, I was a little saddened to know that in this city of millions, I’d never encounter this crazy driver, or his crazy horn again. Unless, just maybe, if I wish really hard for it.

Coconut Man
From my seat on the windowsill, I look out the open window. A man, either fearless or so desperate to earn the day’s bread that fear isn’t a factor, scurries up a palm tree with bare feet, a rope and a sickle. Precariously balanced at the top – eye level from my position in a fourth story flat – he cuts down bunches of coconuts, ties them up and lowers them to the ground 30 meters below. He pulls the rope back up, loops it around the trunk and shimmies back down to (relative) safety.

Just beyond the palm trees, an inlet of the Arabian Sea lies still as glass, reflecting a blue so calm it could quiet even the most restless of minds. Its shores are wrapped in verdant green, the vegetation untouched by the city’s ceaseless expansion. Blinding white egrets, stunning green parakeets, and fearsome falcons float, flap and fly by. Looking out at this small sliver of paradise, this virginal vista, one can imagine the “good bay” the Portuguese sailed into five centuries ago.

Across the water, the golden spire of the Global Vipassana Pagoda points to a lone cloud in an empty blue sky. Six

months ago, I sat under the pagoda’s grand, domed ceiling (the largest such structure in Asia), meditating with none other than S.N. Goenkaji himself – the man who brought the ancient meditation technique back to India from Myanmar. His baritone voice echoed off the stone ceiling, competing with the sniffles, sneezes and coughs of thousands of meditators. He called the Budda the “Super Scientist of Spirituality.” The moniker made me smile.

My mind strayed to some of the students I had served at a Vipassana course in Dehradun – strong, beautiful women that I sent my love to across unknown distances. The meditation over, someone tapped me on the shoulder. I turned, and before I could fully register the face, arms enveloped me in a strong embrace. “I was just thinking of you,” a voice said in my ear. I pulled away and saw the beaming smile of one of the women I had just been thinking about! Reunited with my phone a few minutes later, I received a message from yet another one of those women, wanting to know where I was and if we could meet. I was amazed by the amount of energy in a single

thought.

Back to the present. On my windowsill, looking out. My last month in India; my last month of this great adventure. Some would say it’s being spent rather anticlimactically. I’d say it’s being spent perfectly. I’m the guest of the incredibly generous and beautiful souls Shreesh and Shachi Misra, in their lovely home in Marve, a beachside borough in NW Bombay. I walk the dog. I rearrange furniture, help pick out wallpaper and hang photos. I cook, I bake. Basically, I’ve become a housewife – and it turns out that I’m pretty good at it (which is in no way meant to say that I’m ready to get married).

I’m planning a big Christmas dinner and thinking about serving burritos. Can Mexican food be served at an Indian Christmas? Where do I get tortillas? Sour cream? Can I make my own? These are the biggest dilemmas facing me as I face out of my window. In short, life is good.

I'm going to India! I wanted to write a blog about all my preparations prior to my journey. I have done tons of research on India and specifcially Mumbai where I will be staying. I wanted to know what India was like before I arrive and know what I will be expecting when I get there. I will be living there for eight weeks this summer and I am so excited. I will be working with an organization named Aseeema. Aseema is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping children receieve an education who do not have the opportunity. You may be thinking: India has free education for all citizens why is a non-profit organization needed to ensure education for children? Yes though it is true that the India government has worked hard to provide free education for children, some kids still can't afford it. The people who started the non-profit Aseema realized that the legal provisions made for children was actually different than the reality. They noticed children on the streets of Bandra (located in Mumbai) begging at traffic signals, rag picking and working at tea stalls or garages. Most of these children had never been to school. They started spending two hours each day at the Education Center teaching the children. The Aseema organization's webpage talks about the difficulty they had when first trying to teach the children in a classroom setting. But eventually the kids loved to learn and the organization has expanded from the 18 children it began teaching to 1500 children. On their webpage Aseema outlines their mission ""Aseema's mission is to proide underpriviledged children with a nurturing and stimulating educational environment that helps them recognize their limitless potential.""

After I read this I was sold to the entire cause and ready to make a committment to Mumbai India. To me, education IS the MOST important thing any child needs to make a difference. You could give them money, but money runs out. You could give them a place to live and food to eat, but those run out. If a child receives an education it can and it will change their life. I learned this lesson during the three weeks I spent in Uganda in the Summer of 2012. I volunteered through a non-profit organization called Yofafo (Youth Focus Africa Foundation). This organization was started by a man named Valence. Valence grew up in a small village named Kitoola located an hour outside of the capital city of Kampala. Valence lost both of his parents at a very young age, but was fortunate enough to have his education sponsered by a westerner. For him, this was all he needed. Valence became the first child from Kitoola to graduate college. Valence considered his opportunity as a privilege and was determined to give back and help his village. This was when he started the Yofafo organization. He and many financial support and volunteers rebuilt the school in Kitoola village so that the children could go to school. During my time in Kitoola the small chldren classroom was outside under a patio. Myself and ten other volunteers built an additional building that would allow this baby class to move into a building with walls and a roof and come equipped with their own chalkboard and desks to sit in. I learned then and there that education can make a difference in a child's life. This is why I want to go to India and work with Aseema.

Children in India are facing similar problems as those children living in Kitoola as well as any child living in poverty in any part of the world. Though the education is free in India there are hidden costs to receiving an education. Parents are forced to spend money on uniforms, textbooks, transportation and meals. I read online that Indian parents spend Rs (rupees) 366 per year on these things. So even though the actual education is free for all, if parents don't have this money the child cannot receive this free education. I also speculate that in India another problem is that children in a family are needed to work to help the family have enough money to survive. I don't know this as a fact, but I would like to see if any of my students are required to drop out because they are needed at home to work.

Overall, I am excited to take this journey, but if you ask me tomorrow when I leave for the airport excited wont be my first adjective. I'm honestly terrfied. This will be my first journey alone as well as my first journey to India. Both of these combined is terrifying. If your anything like me, knowing as muc as you can about a place helps ease some nerves. Here are some things I have learned about India:





The language spoken in India is called Hindi (a language I am trying to learn but successfully failing at). But many businesses and most of the people speak English as well. The main religion in India is Hindu with 80%!o(MISSING)f the population practicing the Hindu religion. I didn’t know this before but India has the third largest Muslim population in the world. Some people are Christian and Sikh.

India is such an ancient country that I needed the history lesson from the internet. India began as a very culturally diverse country and was divided into regional kingdoms. Eventually Muslim nomads entered the country and took over. They started a unified country under the Islamic religion. The East India Company again took over India in 1820 and maintained this control until 1947 when India gained its independence. When the British left the entire region became the countries of India, Pakistan and Bangledesh.

Now that I knew India from a historical perspective I also needed to know what I would be experiencing in present day India.I was surprised to read that India is the world’s largest democracy. It’s economy is made of up agriculture, textiles and telecommunications. I knew from social media that it is a big outsourcing destination but other than that I was pretty foreign to India’s economy.

These are the reasons why I want to go to India. I'm so happy to learn about all the information that already fascinated me with India. The culture is amazing and I love how diverse it is. But there still seems like there is so much I don't know and can't figure out from the internet.

To prepare for my journey I have been watching movies like Slumdog Millionaire, watched youtube videos and bothered Appalachian State University librarians to help me find any and every book written by somebody who has gone to India. Overall I am happy with what I have learned this far. I think India is so fascinating and I really can't wait to see it. But I also think that of India as such a vast contry that there is so much to learn. I have given up on trying to research some topics that I know it is just going to take some first hand experience to grasp. Mainly in this category is the caste system. I have learned a little about the caste system from my reading. But mostly what I know is that there is a caste that is entirely made up of people who wash clothes! Basically, I think it is nearly impossible to learn all that I want to know about India simply from researching movies, books and videos. There is something to be said for traveling to a country just to learn. I hope I haven't spoiled this aspect for myself (I'm pretty sure I couldn't if I tried) because I want to learn so much. I think the knowledge I have obtained will simply help me not to look like a dumb tourist who doesn't have a clue about the country I am in. I do still have a lot of questions about India that haven't been answered. These questions have mostly come from snippets of information I have come across. The types of things I am wondering about are:

I wonder if the Muslim and Hindu populations are peaceful. I have not found anything online disussing conflict amongst the two groups, but I did read a book by a news reporter that implied such conflicts do exist. In the prolouge of her book Behind Beautiful Forevers, Katherine Boo describes a young boy named Abdul who is running and trying to hid from the cops who are looking for him in the slums of Annawadi where he lives. ""His home sat midway down a row of hand-built spatchcrock dwellings; the lopsided shed where he stowed his trash was just next door. Some people in his slum wished his family ill because of the old Hindu-Muslim resentments. Others resented his family for the modern reasons, ecoomic envy"" (page x prolouge). These few sentences stand out to me so vividly. I can easily visualize this child Abdul hiding from these cops (the rest of the prolouge describes it in great detail it is hard to not paint a mental image of a child hiding on trash heaps next to his hut). But I can't forget the potential tension Boo subtly points out about the ""old Hindu-Muslim resentments"" and why Adbul's family is discriminated against. Abdul's family is Muslim and according to the book they are one family of just a few that are Muslim. Are Muslim's discriminated against throughout India? Or does it change depding on the region? Or does it depend on the distribution of the majority of the population. I am curious to learn more about these tensions and see if they are just social tensions, political, or as a society do these tensions separate the two relgious groups?

Another thing about India that fascinates yet confuses me is the poverty. My only experiences with extreme poverty are in the countries of Slovakia and Uganda. I went to Slovakia for a week in my tenth grade of high school to build a playground for a school. I didn't realize it until I got to Slovakia, but the school my group was assigned was in the poorest town in the city. These kids didn't have much, but really I was so young it was hard for me to notice poverty. But I know this playground made them happy and looking back it was probably life changing for some of the kids (you have a play ground to play in, it may keep you out of trouble). My other experience was while I was in Uganda. It was so hard seeing so many children without shoes (an amenity I tend to complain about having too many of) and it was even harder to see these children running around, going to the bathroom, and simply walking home without a pair of shoes on their feet. This was rural Uganda where the land provided the food so in some ways these shoeless beautiful children were lucky because they also came to school with mangos and avocados that were grown on the same land they live on. I spent a few days in the capital of Uganda Kampala. This is a different type of poverty all together. In Kampala children come up to your car with their hands held out whispering Lugandan phrases with pleading looks in their eyes. You see beggers on the streets and trash everywhere. This was a different type of poverty but just as hard to see. From my research on India both types of poverty exist. 70%!o(MISSING)f India's population lives in rural areas. Health care is scarce in the rural parts of India which causes many problems for rural Indians like many rural populations worldwide.

Though rural India interests me, sine I will be staying in Mumbai I needed to learn about urban India. I have no past experiences working in an urban setting I'm not even quite sure that I have ever lived in an urban area my entire life. Urban poverty is much different than rural poverty. I think the thing that fascinates, saddens and confuses me the most about urban poverty is the slums. I read the book It Happened on the Way to War by Rye Barcott and that pretty much sums up my only experience learning about urban poor. Rye Barcott travels to Nairobi, Kenya and lives in the slum of Kibera. Throughout the book Rye Barcott describes the Kibera slums. He describes the houses, the lack of sewage, the bathrooms and the smells of Kibera. This was enough to captivate my interest in slum life for my entire life. So when I chose to go on this journey to India I knew I had to work in the slums. I find it fascinating that an entire population can live in one area that had never been planned out. There was never any intention to have that many people live in that one space so basic things like sewage was never considered. I also want to know why people live there. Do they travel to the slums for the potential at a better life since it is closer to the city than rural areas would be? Or are the slums a place people are stuck in and wish to get out of?

With this fascination of slum life I again did tons of research. 60%!o(MISSING)f Mumbai's population lives in slums. This means that there is 60%!o(MISSING)f the population of Mumbai living on only 6%!o(MISSING)f the land. I watched numerous youtube videos on the slums of Mumbai and I noticed things like tilted houses facing each other with sewage running down the middle. Entire fields piled high with trash. People walking through these fileds on large pipes. I even saw slum houses built on top of each other. One video showed three or four stories of slum houses built standing on top of one another. In the book Wanderlust and Lipstick by Beth Whitman she states that slums were formed around mills and housed industrial workers. This information is consistent with the book mentioned earlier Behind Beautiful Forevers by Katherine Boo. Katherine Boo wrote her book about Annawadi which is located right outside the Sahar airport road. Annawadi is a slum I am particularly interested in and most of my research has involved reading about this slum.

It is located near the Sahar aiport just outside Mumbai. Three thousand people live in Annawadi in 335 huts. The majority of people living there are India-Hindus from all castes and subcastes. That main way people of Annawadi make money is from trash. The slum is located near the airport. The airport area has five extravagent hotels. There is a quote from the book I can't resist putting in here. The quote is of Abdul's brother Mirchi, ""Everything around us is roses and were the shit in between."" Boo goes on to describe the slum in proximity to the vast wealth of the aiport area.

""In the new century as India's economy grew faster than any other but China's, pink condos and glass office towers had shot up near the international airport. One corporate office was named simply ""More"". More cranes for making more buildings, the tallest of which interfered with the landing of more and more planes: It was a smogged-out, prosperity-driven obstacle course up there in the overcity from which wads of possibility had tumbled down to the slums"" (page xii prolouge).

This quote stands out to me because of the contradictions that seem to exist in India. I watched one youtube video on Mumbai that began by saying that Mumbai is one big contradiction. One one hand India is the world's largest democracy. It has a great industry in telecommunications and outsourcing. Bollywood alone brings tons of money into the Indian economy. On the other hand you have slums like Annawadi where people make their money scavenging through the trash of nearby luxurious hotels. These people collect the trash of these richer people and trek all the way back to their slum to go to sleep in a hut they share with too many family members. This saddens and confuses me. If a country is doing well and making money then shouldn't all of it's people benefit from this financial success? I read on Global Road Warrior, ""India has become a country exhibiting some of the widest wealth gaps in the world."" On the Lonely Planet I read, ""Glistening skyscrapers and malls mushroom amid slums and grinding poverty, and Mumbai slowly marches towards a brave new (air-conditioned) world. But not everyone made the guest list: more than half of the population lives in slums, and religious-based social unrest tugs at the skirt of Mumbai's financial exess."" Not only does that paint a vivid and contradictory picture but it also answers my previous question of religious tension: apparently it exists!

Now I don't mean to sound like a knight in shinning armour intending to go to India on my white horse and save a country because they are incapable of saving themselves. And I'm not critical of India's wealth gaps either. I would love to see statistics on America's wealth distrubtion or those of any other ""developed"" country. And I do believe that given enough time and enough financial success India will be able to help their poor and solve the problems that their own poor face. Just like I hope one day America will be able to do the same. But these things require changes in laws and time spent building new housing to replace the slums and lots of other things. All I want to do while I am in India is teach children. This is something proactive I can do. And maybe one of the beautiful and bright children who receive and education whether it is through public school or Aseema itself will grow up and make changes in their country. I hope I can make that kind of impact on a child who can make that kind of impact on their country. India is a beautiful country with its own unique ways of living and its own unique problems. I am so excited to go there and learn more see the beauty India has to offer and help fix one problem.

I can't go to India and not be a tourist even though I despise tourism. I do just tell myself it improves a country's economy (that's what I say about my shopping habits in foreign countries as well). But while I was researching the dynamics of India, I also searched things to do while I am there. I wanted to stay close to Mumbai because Ieb know I will be living there and I want to see and learn as much as I can about Mumbai instead of traveling around India and gaining a small understanding of such a large country. Make it my intention to be a ""Mumbai expert"" but in case you are wanting to travel to India as well here are some of the places I read about and hope to see during my journey (the website the Lonely Planet gives better overviews of these places than I do so these exerts are directly from their website):

The one you can't miss even if you tried:

The bold basalt Gateway of India arch faces out to Mumbai Harbour at the tip of Apollo Bunder. Derived from the Islamic styles of 16th-century Gujarat, it was built to commemorate the 1911 royal visit of King George V. It was completed in 1924: ironically, the gateway's British architects used it just 24 years later to parade off their last British regiment, as India marched towards independence.

These days, the gateway is a favourite gathering spot for locals and a top spot for people-watching. Giant-balloon sellers, photographers, beggars and touts rub shoulders with Indian and foreign tourists, creating all the hubbub of a bazaar. Boats depart from the gateway's wharfs for Elephanta Island and Mandwa.

You can ride in a Victoria - one of the horse-drawn gilded carriages that ply their trade along Apollo Bunder. Get them to go around the Oval Maidan at night so you can admire the illuminated buildings - it should cost around Rs300 if you bargain. Hard.

Elephanta Island:

In the middle of Mumbai Harbour, 9km northeast of the Gateway of India, the rock-cut temples on Elephanta Island are a Unesco World Heritage Site and worth crossing the waters for. Home to a labyrinth of cave-temples carved into the basalt rock of the island, the artwork represents some of the most impressive temple carving in all of India. The main Shiva-dedicated temple is an intriguing latticework of courtyards, halls, pillars and shrines, with the magnum opus a 6m-tall statue of Sadhashiva – depicting a three-faced Shiva as the destroyer, creator and preserver of the universe. The enormous central bust of Shiva, its eyes closed in eternal contemplation, may be the most serene sight you witness in India.

Sanjay Ghandi National Park located INSIDE Mumbai:

It’s hard to believe that within 90 minutes of the teeming metropolis you can be surrounded by this 104-sq-km protected tropical forest. Here, bright flora, birds, butterflies and elusive wild leopards replace pollution and crowds, all surrounded by forested hills on the city’s northern edge. Urban development and shantytowns try to muscle in on the edges of this wild region, but its status as a national park has allowed it to stay green and calm.
And the last place that is a must see is the Jaipur Elephant Festival. I love elephants so I definitely have to see this. Jaipur is at least located on West side of India also so it may be a good weekend destination.

Overall I am excited and nerovous for my trip to India. But if any of my previous trips are an indication I'm sure I will be leaving a part of my heart behind in Mumbai and I will be dying to return to the city I know I will fall in love with.

P1010994
I arrived in Delhi on the morning of Diwali, which is said to be as significant as Christmas in the USA. My new roommate Diwik invited me out to a Diwali Party. I had forgotten how bad the air gets on Diwali. You see Indians ignite millions of fireworks of the same kind you would see in a US city for the 4th of July. The big difference is that every citizen can buy and ignite these professional level fireworks that shoot 10-20 stories up into the air and explode into multi-colors, just like the 4thof July.

I had forgotten how bad the air gets when everyone can purchase and ignite their own professional grade fireworks. The air was so full of smoke; I had a splitting headache, a congested chest, and a 102 degree temperature by morning. I proceeded to sleep the next 18 hours drifting in and out of delirium as my body thought it could fight the smog with fever. 24 hours after my arrival in India, I was a wreck.

Granted, it could have been a bug I caught on the plane to India. In fact, that is more likely given I had been traveling
P1011031
for 24 hours, 17 of which were within enclosed aircraft and 7 hours on layovers. But even if I had caught a bug on the flight, the smoke filled air was not helping me.

The weekend was fast approaching so I decided to catch a flight out of town and find a less populated area with less smoke. I searched on the top places to visit in India and discovered there were two places in the top 10 of India that I hadn’t visited yet. One was in the south of India and too far for a weekend get-away. The other was just an hour away by air and in a low population density area of India--perfect for my low pollution needs.

I flew to Maharashtra to see the Ajanta Caves (200 BC) and the Ellora Caves (400 AD).

Upon arrival, I slept another 18 hour day, and woke feeling much better. My fever was almost gone. So I ventured out to see these famous caves.

With the exception of one castle and one temple, and all the photos taken on the road to the caves, all of these photos are caves cut into mountains. There
P1010689
is no construction in these caves. With hammer and chisel, generations of craftsmen, from as early as the year 200 BC, walked up to granite cliffs, and began chiseling.

Michelangelo is rumored to have said, and I am paraphrasing, he did not chisel large pieces of marble into statues, he just removed the surface marble to reveal what was already below. A modest man no doubt. Imagine walking up to a granite cliff with a chisel and hammer and spending generations to complete one of these grand caves. I am not elevating the caves to the detail found in Michelangelo’s work, but do remember that these were completed as much as 17 centuries before Michelangelo was born.

Now I head back to Delhi to start my black belt training in 6 Sigma. 6 Sigma is a process design and improvement certification course. It doesn’t teach you how to defend yourself from a physical assault. Rather, it teaches you how to gather and analyze data about a process to save time and money, and improve the quality of that process. I am excited about learning this new discipline.

Happy Diwali everyone, and good luck to my Indian friends

November 2nd 2012

Hey everyone,

Like usual I've taken way too much time in writing a blog post. I've actually finished my term in Mumbai already, but I'm gonna fill you guys in on what's been going on since then and then tell you what's going on now!

Finishing the school term was pretty much torture, but everything besides school just got better and better with time. After a period of feeling really down because of college and a boring routine of a life, I decided to take a change and things really improved. I realized my college wasn't even taking my attendence, so I could do what I wanted! So I went to Goa with another Canadian girl named Renee and had one of the wildest weekends of my life I think, ha. Goa really was everything it has a reputation for, really different from the rest of India. It was then that I also had my first experience on an Indian train; in cramped compartments and families taking care of crying babies, with people walking by chatting every 5 minutes, somehow it still has a charm of the Indian style. This was in North Goa, and I even ended up staying an extra night!

On top of that I found a really good group of friends in Mumbai, mostly French actually, and some Indians too, who mostly all live in Bandra and who I've been spending a lot of time with. We've been to a lot of ladies nights at Lagerbay, and have spent a lot of nights in together as well. A few of us even went to Goa (again) together! These times to Goa have been some of the first times that I've had a holiday, meaning traveling just for the sake of traveling, alone with friends. Most of my other travels have been for a purpose or with some sort of 'adult' figure, so it was a really nice experience. We went to South Goa, which was a lot more chilled out, but also very beautiful, and had an awesome time together on the beach.

At the beginning I thought I would focus on meeting Indian friends to try and really connect with the people of the country I was in. Although I did make Indian friends, there were only a few who I could really connect with. I don't know if it was a cultural difference or a maturity gap between me and a lot of the students in college, but I found it was a lot easier to connect with other exchange students, and a few really awesome Indians. In general, while talking to other students my age in college, I felt like I was talking to people younger than me, with completely different perspectives. Obviously that is really interesting, and I tried to take advantage of that, but when it comes to my day to day life I wanted to be able to be with people I felt comfortable or could at least relate to. I know the point of an exchange is to have that other experience, and I did, however you can't force relationships, and I believe the feeling of not being able to really connect was mutual, even if we got along (though there were also many that I just didn't get along with ha).

My friend Bridget from Spanish class in Ottawa came to visit me in Mumbai, she was volunteering in a village in the north of India for the summer and was traveling around India. We spend a couple days together, and even though I was getting over an awful flu, saw a lot of Bombay together. We had tea at the Taj Hotel, which was just lovely (I hope I can actually stay there one day), visited a mosque, a mandir, a church and a synagogue all in one day, had a lovely dinner and more. It was really nice to see a Canadian friend in Mumbai!

Oh yeah! Seems like forever ago already, but I got an undercut! Hah, undercut and India don't really seem to go together, but I wanted a change and figured I might not get another opportunity in my life to have crazy hair. I went with my friend Arnaud and we got crazy haircuts together, fun! I was really nervous, but I'm glad I did it. It's growing out now. Around the same time I locked myself out of my apartment the same weekend that Jonny and my landlady was out of town. This happened at 10pm, and thankfully I was just with my friend Claire who let me sleep at her place. Learning experience for sure!

Something I've come to love in India is riding on motorbikes (the back of them, I'm too nervous to try riding them myself after hearing a lot of horror stories)! My first great experience was with an Indian friend named Garth, when we were riding back to my place on his bike and it just started POURING rain. Maybe it doesn't sound fun but it was amazing, I'll never forget the feeling.

Anyways I'll leave it at that, a pretty quick blog post to sum up the last few months in Mumbai. Hope you enjoy and will post another about my travels soon!

The obvious poverty in Mumbai is an eye opener to say the least. To see a man laying half dead in the street while everyone passes him by and an elderdely woman lying helpless in the street is hard to consume as is seeing kids shooting up at the side of the road and children no older than 4 or 5 out at night time begging for money when they should be safe in a place we call home . . . In contrast there is a new Mumbai emerging out of the old that is establishing the Cafe culture and the economy is vast growing and emerging with western society. If this is a good thing or not is something of a debate! which we had with a local Indian business man who was pro franchise, McDonalds!

You cannot help but get caught up in the energy of Mumbai with it's sights, smells and interesting people. It is like a city that has been built and almost forgotten about but has a life of it's own that keeps going and seems to be moving forward. The poverty line still remains and as like many other cities in the world
Mumbai Building Site
people with no money come here to make a better life from the tourism trade.

Jess and me have had an amazing experience in Mumbai and it will be somewhere that stays with us forever as a part of this trip. I think if you came here you would leave taking something with you that would stick with you forever too . . . 😊

Mumbai Taxi !!!!!
Well the last one isn't true but it's a nod to the one and Only . . . So we have been to Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Mumbai in 3 days, if only briefly in the first two. The first day in Mumbai was MANIC!! we came out of Raj's place in the morning to a deafining Mumbai rush hour and what can only be described as organised chaos!. As we wanted to get a real feel for the place we decided to take the local train from the North to the South. You know those pictures you have seen of people running across the track when trains are coming, people hanging onto the side of trains, well thats where we were 😊 I nearly ended up on an all female coach, which can land you a 1000 Rupee fine!! we were the only westerners in sight, which was brilliant!! we got to see lots of things we wouldnt have had gone by taxi, the places people live, the slums, the different kinds of people that make their lively hoods on those platforms. We managed to find our way to the next hostel and from there went to see the Gatway
Jess at the 'Gateway to India'
to India and get used to the madness of Mumbai. . .

Gandhi's house
Mani Bhavan – A short blog about Gandhi-ji

The monsoon rains forced me to cancel my trip to Pune so I decided to visit Mani Bhavan, the house where Mahatma Gandhi lived for many years. Located in downtown Mumbai, this house served as Gandhi’s base for almost twenty years and was the focal point for all his political activities during this time. A beautiful house on a leafy, tree-lined street, it has now been turned into a museum and archive to celebrate his life and achievements and I felt that a visit was essential. If Barack Obama felt it necessary to visit during his State Visit in 2010, I thought it was only right to follow his lead.

(A short aside: You may be asking why I refer to Gandhi in the title of this blog as Gandhi-ji. The –ji suffix denotes respect of your elders and is added to the names of your elders and others you should look up to and respect. Me, I’m just plain Mr. Tim to most people – I haven’t earned the –ji yet!)

Jumping into a tuk-tuk (which I’ve been misspelling through all my blogs …), the three-wheeled auto- rickshaw mega-prevalent
The oval plaque, reminiscent of the blue plaques in London
on the streets of Mumbai, I settled in for what I thought would be a forty-minute trip to Gamdevi district … only for the vehicle to stop on the expressway as he wasn’t allowed into the centre of the city. Standing by the side of the highway, I had to flag down a taxi to finish my journey, only to find the one driver who didn’t know where Mani Bhavan was! When we finally arrived, it was strange to experience the calm and tranquillity of Laburnam Street after struggling through the traffic and noise for almost two hours.

(A short aside: Two cows and their handlers walked down the street in front of me as I turned the corner, depositing their little souvenirs as they made their slow way through the traffic. Every day, I get constant reminders like this that I am a long way from home!)

An oval plaque marks the house and I entered the lobby where a bronze bust of Gandhi watches over visitors, still festooned with garlands from his birthday celebrations earlier in the week. Continuing inside, I entered the Gandhi Reference Library, packed floor to ceiling with rare books and pamphlets.
The bronze bust watching over us
The curator was speaking to a small group of tourists and several people were sitting at the tables poring through the reference books and taking notes. That was cool. Then, through a side door, I heard what was definitely the voice of a lecturer speaking to a large crowd of students. I discovered that they were members of the Gandhi Society, a group of locals devoted to keeping alive the ideals of the great man. I would have stayed to listen but the lecture was in Hindi so I went upstairs to see the exhibits. They have preserved his bedroom, authentic to the last time he stayed here in the 1930’s. It was very peaceful, a simple room, but down deep I think Gandhi was a simple man. A firm believer in rights for everyone, and passionate about home rule (and the expulsion of the British Raj), he did most of his work and held many of his meetings with members of Congress in this small room.

Gandhi-ji was a true thorn in the side of the British Raj, encouraging non-violence in all things, and making the Indian public believe that home rule was not only possible, it was
Gandhi-ji's Room
their innate right. It took many years, and it wasn’t perfect for everyone, but it eventually came about in 1947. (I don’t want to bore you with the details of Indian Independence, as a quick visit to Google will tell you way more than I ever could.)

No museum is complete without a gift shop but this one was different, with tables of Indian cotton fabric and saris to look through and books and pamphlets available to fill in the story of Gandhi’s life. No tacky plastic statues or wall hangings here, the gift shop maintained the overall ambience of the building, calm and peaceful … and filled with really cool stuff.

I finished my visit and went outside to sit in the shade and just think about what I had just experienced before I would have to be on my way, re-entering the hustle and bustle of Mumbai proper. I felt a weird sense of calm and contentment as I looked up at the house. Almost sixty-five years after Gandhi’s death at the hands of an assassin unhappy with the divided land of India and Pakistan, the man and his works are still inspiring people all around
Cars and tuk-tuks and cows, oh my!
the world … including this farangi from England.

Smudge on the forehead...
An aside: A good friend alerted me today to an inaccuracy in my previous blog. I stated that many of the city name changes in India took place just after independence from the British Empire. I should have checked Wikipedia first, I guess, as Madras was only renamed Chennai in 1996 and, as Wikipedia states in Mumbai's case, ""the English name was officially changed to Mumbai in November 1995. This came at the insistence of the Marathi nationalist Shiv Sena party that had just won the Maharashtra state elections and mirrored similar name changes across the country. A theory was proposed suggesting that ""Bombay"" was a corrupted English version of ""Mumbai"" and an unwanted legacy of British colonial rule.""

Oh well, I guess you can't get them right all the time. Just so you don't feel you've wasted this visit to my blog, here's a sneak peek at a photograph of me taken after I was blessed during the Ganesha festival. Read all about it soon...

1: Kurla Departs 11 secs


CST
One thing I had promised myself about this trip to India was that I would do my best to experience it as a native Indian does. I would travel as they travel and, as much as possible, eat what they eat. So, no McDonalds, KFC, or ham and cheese sandwiches and more Guajarati Thali, biryanis, lentil dahls and the like. (I have eaten at Subway but that was a Chicken Tandoori sub so that doesn’t count, right?) Indian food at the source is nothing like the westernized versions we taste every day in the UK and America; not every curry burns your mouth and every region has its own distinct flavours and textures. Some I’ve loved, others have just been a little too strange for me like the sweets made of chickpeas and the restaurants where they ask you if you would like some lard for your roti or chapati, but hey, it’s all part of the experience. I feel sometimes that we have the basic menu available to us, changed and bastardized to fit the western palate, but here I would be able to try it all.

In Mumbai, I wanted to try, do and experience everything. I began
CST
by visiting Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, the busiest train station in Mumbai, and referred to by locals as CST or its original name, Victoria Terminus. Built in 1887, steam trains of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway travelled as far as Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai from this gothic architectural masterpiece.

(A short aside: After Independence from the British in 1947, many cities, railways stations and government buildings received a swift name change – Calcutta reverted to its original name Kolkata, Madras became Chennai and Victoria Terminus was renamed in honour of Chhatrapati Shivaji, a famous Maratha hero. The international airport also bears his name.)

With many long-distance trains now departing from Mumbai Central, this is the commuter hub for the city and the trains are packed fuller than any I have ever seen. While Tokyo subways cram their passengers into compartments with long sticks before the doors slide shut, here they leave the doors open and people hang from the sides to cool down during their trips. It’s a dangerous way to travel but once you’ve been stuck in the middle of crowded compartment with no air conditioning, you’ll understand why they take the risk … and why every
cst
passenger carries a handkerchief to wipe away the sweat. Did I tell you that it was hot here?

(A short aside: I know what you’re saying. With centuries of history surrounding me, why would I close a railway station as my first port of call. While stating categorically that I am not a trainspotter nerd, I am fascinated with the trains here which despite being elderly and very well used, manage to run efficiently and mostly on time. Most large train stations here have a fabrication shop either on site or close by where parts are manufactured from scratch for these behemoths. The spare parts for these antiques are no longer being made in the west so when they need something, they crank up the metal lathe and make one. The trains are being modernized now across India but I still feel there’s a certain romance with an engine which just keeps on working despite the fact that it is thousands of miles from the factory where it was first created and the spare parts it needs are found more in museums than hardware stores.)

I made my way through the crowds and traffic and entered the station
cst
through the original massive, carved wood doors which just seemed to welcome me in. I was dazzled, first by the people streaming by me and then, when I had found a quiet place just to people watch, the architecture and stained glass of the booking hall. It reminded me of St. Pancras Station in London, and for some reason, it fitted right into its surroundings. I bought my platform ticket and strode inside. I was hoping to find some original signs from the early days but they were all covered up with billboards and flashing neon timetables and adverts. It was while waiting here that I experienced my first thimble-sized cup of chai. This spiced black tea, infused with spices and mixed with hot milk, appeared to me to be the Indian staple drink when locals are out on the streets. Everywhere I went there were little stands where the men sipped the chai and conversed with friends next to stands serving samosas and other fried foods. The aromas were intoxicating but I wasn’t quite ready to experience street food until I found out just exactly what it was.

(A short aside: I was reliably informed before this trip
cst
that everyone in Mumbai spoke English. Let me just clarify that statement. Most people speak English but I have yet to find a street trader who understands a single word I say. I tried to learn some basic Hindi before I came but please, thank you, my name is tim, how are you, I’m fine, and which way to the closest restroom don’t really get you that far. Perhaps it’s my accent…)

Anyway, a chai wallah was walking through the station and I motioned him over, gesturing that I would like one. He poured it into the smallest plastic cup I have ever seen and charged me five rupees, or about 6P or a dime. It was an experience, the incredible flavour nothing like the chai lattes we have back at home. This had ginger, cardamom, pepper and about a dozen other contrasting tastes I couldn’t identify but which all came together to make the perfect drink. I was hooked. The only downsize was the size of the cup and when I finished mine and looked around for more, he was gone.

Anyway, back to the station and why I wanted to come here. I wandered down to
gateway
the platform, the only European in sight, getting loads of sideways glances but lots of smiles and hellos so that was cool. The 535 to Kurla was about to depart so I said hello to the driver and asked him about his journey. Luckily, he spoke English and told me his name was Sayed and that he’d been a driver for over twenty years. First employed with the Hill Railways which serviced Simla, a resort town in the north, he had transferred to Mumbai only three weeks ago so his daughter could attend university. He was saddled with the commuter run so he missed the open countryside but he said that he was enjoying it. Indians take education very seriously and most people have a degree … or several. With jobs at a premium, it’s not a surprise to find a barista at a local coffee shop with several degrees just waiting for a graduate position to open up somewhere.( So, no different to the west then, eh?)

He was about to leave but he let me sound the whistle (yeah, I’m just a big kid at heart) and the train pulled away only to be replaced by another just minutes later. After walking around the station for awhile, I decided it was time to visit The Gateway of India just a short walk away. This iconic landmark was built on the quayside in 1924 to commemorate the visit of a British Monarch but also to glorify the permanence of the British Empire. Little did they know that just a few decades later, a little man in a loincloth known as Gandhi-ji would inspire his people to restore their homeland to home rule, sending the British packing but leaving this arch as a reminder of their presence.

The place was packed but with Indian tourists rather than Europeans or Americans. Again, I was the only white face there but I wasn’t intimidated, I was welcomed and the street vendors surrounded me. Buy a balloon? Have your picture taken? Have some chai? So, no balloons for me but I took them up on their offer of chai and a photograph by the Arch. It was actually quite cool; the photographers carried portable printers in their bags and for 40 rupees you could walk away with a small souvenir of your visit. I told the photographer that he could take my picture if I could take one of him in return. He smiled and said yes, laughing when I told him that I would only charge him 80 rupees for the privilege! All around, tourists were eating ice creams, sipping chai, chomping on peanuts … and then the heavens opened! I was lucky that I came at the end of the monsoon season, a rainy deluge across the Summer which at times is fierce and unending, at other times a short five minute burst followed by blazing sunshine which makes you feel like a damp cloth. This was one of the latter and everyone, and I mean everyone, ran for cover … only to be surrounded by umbrella salesmen who appeared as if from nowhere. A girl standing at my side told me not to buy one, I wouldn’t need it, and she was right. It was a crazy end to the day but I made my way back to my apartment, resembling a drowned rat, and began to think of the next day. What would I do to top this? You’ll have to wait to find out.

Greetings!
Mumbai – A City of Contrasts, A City Alive

Allow me to set the scene. When I was younger, I read an article in National Geographic entitled India By Rail. It described in incredible detail, and with amazing photographs, the railway network in India. It didn’t concentrate on the machinery but rather the people who kept it running and the villages, towns and cities it visited as it made its way across the massive, unbelievably diverse country known as India. I was fascinated by the history and culture and kept the magazine, imagining that one day I would be able to experience it for myself. In the years that followed, I got married – twice – and had children – three – and the dream remained exactly that – unrealized and filed away in a metaphorical box entitled Someday.

(A short aside: I should clarify that this isn’t a sob story about how poor little Timmy never got to do anything. Courtesy of a childhood as a military brat, I had travelled the world and lived in four different countries before I was sixteen. England, America, Germany and Italy had each been my home and I had a great
Welcome to Mumbai!
childhood with an amazing family around me. I have volunteered in Africa and watched the sun rise over Half Moon Bay in California; I’ve swum in the crystal clear waters in Italy and hiked the Yorkshire Moors. I’ve done many things of which I am proud and seen things you wouldn’t believe. I am happily married and my three children constantly make me proud … but always in the back of mind was India. Back to the blog.)

Fast forward an awful lot of years and here I am, sitting in a sidewalk café on the streets of Mumbai, sipping a cup of chai, mopping my brow, and writing a blog about my Indian Adventure. Hard to believe but I am actually here and this is my story.

On September 11th, I boarded a flight for Mumbai with a stopover in Dubai. The flight was uneventful but the stopover was an eye-opener. Landing after midnight, the city was lit up and I could see the buildings which had received so much coverage in recent years. Skyscrapers of such impeccable and inspired construction, they reminded me of tall palaces rather than the offices and hotels they were. A millionaire’s
AKA Victoria Terminus
playground was how it appeared to me and the terminal was no different. Interspersed with the chain stores and food outlets (including a very cool Starbucks…) were gold and jewellery stores which dazzled, not only with the luxury of the product but also with the price tags. I was going to window shop but I was worried that there would be a price on that as well so I had my cup of coffee and waited for my next flight, a two and a half hour hop which would get me into Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport - Mumbai!

(A short aside: When the term Bollywood is used, people imagine colourful, exciting musicals with way too many songs and dances crowbarred into every available space. On the flight, I decided to watch a few Indian films to get into the mood and my first choice was a drama entitled Kahaani, starring the very popular actress Vidya Balan. Incredible film, great acting and sporting a twist at the end with the same impact as Usual Suspects, it both captivated and entertained me. If you’ve never experienced Bollywood, this is great film to introduce you to the Bollywood community. )

It
Starbucks Dubai
was almost 3am when I finally arrived but with Mumbai being five hours ahead of England, I wasn’t tired and I was ready for immigration and customs … or so I thought. The hall was packed, a line of people snaking back and forth between the ropes, waiting for the very bored officials to stamp our passports and allow us to continue to Customs. Three booths were open for visitors and ten for those of Indian descent. It reminded me of Chicago Airport where I once waited for over two hours only to be told that, as a Dual National, I could have gone through the shorter line. This time, there were no saving graces and I waited patiently with everyone else. Once through after a perfunctory glance at my visa and a quick stamp on my passport , I headed off to Customs where I was waved through in less than thirty seconds and I passed through the glass doors marked Namaste. I was in India! I was excited and smiling, something I definitely couldn’t say for my driver Nansingh who had been waiting for me since Midnight! He took me out into the Mumbai night and I encountered my first cultural shock, the first of many. After leaving the air conditioned terminal, the heat and moisture of the night hit me like a slap in the face. It was almost four in the morning but it was unbelievably hot! Jungle Hot. Even Tarzan wouldn’t like it this hot! I felt as though I were sitting in a sauna, fully clothed … and wearing a fur coat!

(A short aside: The use of the term ‘fur’ in the previous paragraph in no way condones or endorses the use of real fur. For the purposes of this blog, please imagine that I am referring to fake fur. Thank you.)

Thankfully, the car was air conditioned and we headed off to Lalco Residency, the apartment where I would be spending the next month. The highway was packed and oh so noisy, a real surprise for this time of night. It was here that I was introduced to my second cultural shock – the constant and deafening use of car horns! They don’t use them here to warn drivers that they are getting too close, they use them to tell others that they are going to squeeze their vehicle through a space more suitable for a bicycle! It was as if seven lanes of traffic were packed into a three lane road but it didn’t seem to phase anyone, other than me. Coming off the highway and onto the surface streets, I began to see more of the city. Small shops with names like Buckets and Tuckets, Sagaani Tailory (yes, that’s how it was spelled…), and Café Coffee Day shared the streets with familiar names like McDonalds, Vodaphone and the like. We finally pulled into Lalco and I headed in to registration. The room was excellent and I unpacked and hit the sack, ready for my first day in the city. I set my alarm and crashed, my first day over. When I awoke, I would finally get to experience Mumbai. My first stop of the day would be Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, formerly known as Victoria Station, but more about that next time.

The Iron Fort – as known to Lohagad – is one of the strongest forts in Maharastra and obviously is in much better condition withstanding the scorching heat of summer and relentless rain in the monsoon. The name Iron Fort henceforth bears enough significance of its strength and power.

On Friday, we started planning for a trek on saturday for entire group. We selected Lohagad since it was supposed to be a trek for beginners like me. Many people promised, many showed interest, then after showing reasons many dropped off the plan; But finally 7 of us stuck together to make this trip successful. So a special thanks goes to Sandeep, Sopal, Rasika, Shubhangi, Ishant and Rahul- in no particular order. And obviously, The Seventh Person is me.

We chalked out the mission on Phone calls. The plan was – 6 of us(who are from Pune) will meet near Wakad Fly-Over at 7.00AM, travel to Malavli on bikes and reach there after an hour or so and then Pick-Up Rasika (who is from Mumbai, will meet us at Malavli Station), travel to Lohagad village (Triple on One Bike) via Lonawala and start the trek, We’d come back following the reverse order of the plan. We also outlined who’ll be riding with whom on the bikes and promised to meet at the Wakad at 7.00 am Sharp.

But, as usual there are few late-comers in every plan… Rahul picked me up at 7.15 in the morning on the D-day and we were at Wakad by 7.40 am. We reached Malavli Station at 8.40 am, where Rasika was waiting for us. Then, we all (me, rahul and Rasika- Triple Seated) traveled to Lonawala. We stopped at a small food joint to have our breakfast – Tea and garma-garam Wadapav. The greenery already started making itself visible, like a teaser of a movie. So without wasting much time, we were started off for further journey.

We drove to Lonavla railway station and then were at the mercy of locals (due to no sign boards) to guide us to Lohagadwadi (10 km from railway station) which is the base camp for the trek. The road had many steep hair-pin bends and is relatively empty. As we were about to reach at the base camp, we spotted a nice location and stopped our bikes there to capture Pics….

At the basecamp, we parked our vehicals at a Small Dhaba, had chai there and set out for our trek. We started the trek at 10.30 am, equipped with cameras, waterbottle and windcheaters. There are huge steps for most part which makes it easy to climb, but the rain and the moss made the climb challenging. We also had company in the form of monkeys, which were dangling and running here and there; and we all girls were getting scared of them. The trek was enjoyable because of lovely monsoon, as it was raining little-little after some intervals.

Lohagad is a beautiful fort in a beautiful location,But thankfully, it has survived the commercialization and the mess that other forts has been subjected to near Pune. The fort is still in a good condition and relatively clean. Many of the structures on the fort are still intact and climbing the fort would give you the feeling of actually climbing a fort rather than walk on “made in 21st century” concrete steps!

Rain was our constant companion with us but we didn't bother because that was the fun – walking in the rain. Everyone seemed to have high spirits. We took much time to climb up the fort, as we stopped for every possible photo opportunity. Once we reached the Top, we were stunned by the exciting views of pavna lake, visapur fort and the greenery around. But what won my heart were the stunning 360 degree views which the fort offered and a reverse rain phenomenon in which we got completely drenched!.

The fort has five huge gates. The top of the fort has a temple dedicated to shivaji, hanuman and Mahadev. There is a Ghumat on Top. A set of caves on the right of the entrance were used to store the wealth of Surat raids During reign of Shivaji Maharaj. The fort has a big pond, and small small fishes in it….We all sat by the pond’s side dipping our legs in it.

Later we started our march towards Vinchukata fortification, and really the trek towards fortification was quite tough because of rains. We were carefully trying to climb down, sometimes we were crawling on knees as well, But in this tough descend, Rahul supported me lot and hold my hand for entire duration…This was the best part of trek, we enjoyed it very much….

After enjoying and having yummy dhoklas on Machi for over an hour, we began our descent towards base through harsh rain and slippery stairs trying to hold each other so as to avoid slipping… The descent was much tougher but the excitement was not yet over.

We were drenched as we reached the base camp, but a hearty lunch of omlet and jhunka bhakar was a perfect end to a trek.

Namaste Everyone! After months of planning, my trip to India is so close I can almost taste it. I've had all my injections, my malaria tablets and industrial strength insect repellent are already packed and ready to go and now I just have the weekend to wait. I've learned a few basic Hindi phrases but everyone I talk to tells me that in Mumbai, everyone speaks English so I should be okay on that front. I've done my research and my working visa is in place in my passport. Boxes are ticked.



Twenty eight days in a foreign land, a world so very different than my own, awaits. I'll be posting frequently so I'm hoping that my friends will be able to savour, through me, the wonders of India. I can't wait.



Oh, and the day I arrive, Mumbai is scheduled for 130mm (or about five inches) of rain. Travelling there on the tail end of the monsoon season, I suppose that's only to be expected, but I won't allow that to dampen my excitement. India, here I come!

Enjoying the view on the toy train
And so to the final leg of my Indian adventure, one that would see me navigating huge sections of India to take in places and people seemingly from different worlds as the diversity of India hit me fully in the face. I tracked to the mountainous north of India with its Tibetan vibe and holidaying Indians, right down to the laid back beaches of the South and finished off on the west coast in cosmopolitan Mumbai. From Amristar I entered the state of Himachal Pradesh, which is nearly as north as you can go in India (you can actually go higher to Kashmir, but years of civil unrest and violence between India and Pakistan in this region sort of scared me off, what a girl). Rather than entering a new state, it was as though I had entered an entirely different country. The change in landscape and people was immediate as most of this region sits at least 2000 metres up so views of lush green valleys, soaring mountains and fast flowing rivers were all around, the air was fresh and the temperature dropped from near 40 to a pleasant 20, and the pace of life was altogether slower. The Himalayas
Smaller waterways by canoe
were the backdrop while timeless villages dotted the slopes, evidence of the British era lingered on and stoned hippies wandered around trying to find themselves. It was quite a contrast to the rest of India with it traffic filled, people heavy cities.

McLeod Ganj

Sadly after giving it the big sell in the guidebook my first stop was a massive disappointment and second only to Delhi on my sh*t list. But first a brief history lesson if I may just to set the scene: In 1950 China invaded Tibet and took control of the independent state under the wonderful guise of 'improving the quality of life' of the Tibetan people. I hadn't taken Mao or the Chinese to be so helpful and empowering but there we are. All this scared the Dalai Lama so much that he fled the country and set up a government-in-exile in McLeod Ganj. I was therefore expecting to turn up and see monks in robes wandering around,Tibetan people living freely, monasteries lining the streets and hear prayers rolling across the hills, I even had designs on meeting the Dalai and pinching his cute cheeks. Instead all I found was Indians on holiday, hotels,
Chinese fishing nets-Cochin
restaurants, neon signs and techno music, souvenir stands and blissed out backpackers trying to study yoga or Buddhism. We (myself and 2dutchies) visited the Dalai's residency but the cuddly one was elsewhere preaching and the apparently interesting museum was closed. If I now start believing in Jesus the Dalai only has himself to blame. Instead we spent the rest of the day on a walk to the next town of Bhagsu to visit a not so powerful waterfall. The day was saved by drinking whiskey with 3 young indian guys alongside the waterfall,as you do. After a day I left there and headed on up to Manali with the dutchie Tom, a very switched on 19 year old that was also a good laugh, who I would end up spending 5 days with in total and so became my longest travel partner of the trip.

Manali

Manali is known as the adventure capital as you can do a range of activities here, plus it is set amid beautiful scenery so is nice to trek around. The people there looked and acted differently from anywhere else in the country as they were of Tibetan or Kashmiri descent and the
Victoria Terminus
food changed from indian curry to noodles and momo(dumplings). We did a 13km trek to Solang Nullah which gave a nice insight into the traditional villages and ways of life as we passed through. The wooden houses and weathered people were more simple and traditional as opposed to poor, women wearing shawls and men in felt hats etc, all growing the apples the region is famous for. The trek gave pleasing views and the cloud cover was so low, or us so high, that we walked amongst it a lot of the time which is always a wonderful effect. Manali will also stick in my mind for the travellers there, as it was stuffed full of stoners and hippies. Marijuana grows everywhere up here and is smoked openly by all, so the place is full of westerners in baggy trousers and ridiculous hair, talking about higher levels of consciousness and being one with the earth while pondering the ways one can transcend to a higher plain. Whilst checking their Facebook,cough. It was one of those places saved by good company and good conversation with Tom and 2 crazy Italians, but otherwise Manali was fairly uneventful.

Shimla

I stopped
Mumbai architecture
off here to break up the journey to Delhi, or perhaps delay the inevitable. I had heard bad things about Shimla, that it was basically like McLeod only worse, and in a way this was true. But the longer I spent in this place the more it grew on me, there wasn't a vast amount to do and yet I spent a good couple of hours in a great cafe eating vegetable pakora and sipping tea, people watching the Indian middle and upper class families on holiday. I found it quaint the longer I watched, there were ice creams eaten, families posing for pictures, kids playing with balloons or riding horses up and down the main street and an abundance of holiday type mood. It was a little like Brighton only without the sea, or the rampant homosexuality. I must also give a quick mention to the fact that shimla is the only place so far that has a no litter, smoking, or spitting policy with fines for doing any of them and it is wonderful, it makes such a difference and I can only hope that the rest of India follows suit. Eventually I stopped watching rich indians play
Indians on holiday, ice creams and horses-Shimla
and trekked to the top of a ridiculously steep hill to visit the Jakhu temple, a place perhaps most noted for being tormented by monkeys, they harass anybody visiting and are sheer entrepreneurs. I witnessed a monkey steal a woman's scarf and would only pass it back in exchange for a bag of food, literally hand for hand. It was like watching a mix of pure Darwin and Alan Sugar. This was about as good as Shimla got so I took the train to Delhi, the first part being the Himalayan Queen toy train. I was expecting the Orient Express but should have realised this was India as it was a fairly basic rickety old thing but the trip down through the mountains was very scenic and worth doing, I had a great couple of hours sitting at the open door with my feet dangling out watching the landscape go by. Eventually I got to Delhi and realised I had 8 days left, so upon deciding not to waste that long in a city I did a last minute job and jumped on a plane to South India, such is the spontaneity of travelling.

Kerala

Once again South
Monkey temple-Shimla
India was like entering another country, and in a way it is just that. The language, landscape, noise, laid back attitude and pace of life is all so different than in a Delhi or Agra. It is surrounded by rice paddies and coconut groves, houseboats cruising down backwaters and sandy beaches. Its position along the trade route means it has tea plantations, English churches, Portuguese houses, Jewish synagogues and Muslim mosques, plus working elephants replace lazy cows-the animals not the women. I started off in the city of Cochin, where I did the main attraction there and travelled through a section of the 900km waterways that traverse the land. It is a little like Venice in terms of the waterways being the way that a lot of people here move around, work and even go shopping. First I went on a houseboat and floated along the main canals lined by palm trees. After this we got into punted canoes and were taken through smaller waterways to see villages up close and watch them make all manner of things from coconuts, mainly rope from the hair and alcohol from the milk but sadly no bras. It was a full day trip
Shimla
which gave a good flavour of traditional life here that hasn't changed for centuries. Next I took the ferry across to the island named Fort Cochin to have a look at the stunning cantilevered Chinese fishing nets. Sadly they weren't in use that day but in a way it made them look even more serene and historical as they date back a thousand years, I imagine they would look amazing in full flight. After this I decided to treat myself with some well deserved beach time because as fascinating as these trips are, relaxing is not a term you can attribute to them. Yeah your heat bleeds right? I initially planned Goa but heard it was a little dead at this time of year, plus the northern sisters I met on the camel safari were a little way down the coast so I decided to stalk them instead and headed south to a place called Varkala. Here I spent a few lazy days working on the tan, it was great spending time with the girls again with the only stress being simply choosing when and where where to eat or how many games of cards I could lose. A holiday
Houseboast cruise-Allepey
within my holiday really.

Mumbai

Last up was the city formerly known as Bombay. I only had 2 full days here so tried to squeeze in as much as I could but the heat, traffic and 17million population got in the way at times. I instantly liked the vibe of Mumbai though and it is an entirely different city from Delhi despite having more people and the biggest slum in Asia. Mumbai is quite cosmopolitan and glamorous as there is a lot of money here, the people don't hassle you in the streets and the architecture is stunning. Mixed in amongst the skyscrapers and towering apartment blocks are remnants of the past as majestic Victorian buildings can be seen everywhere. Most impressive is the Victoria terminus, which is technically a train station but looks more like Notre Dame and is very gothic, plus the court house, cathedrals and courts were very easy on the eye. There is the Gateway of India along the docks which stares at the pompous Taj Mahal Palace hotel, both built in the early 1900's, and I also took a ferry across to visit Elephanta island which has a group of cave temples carved
View from hotel-Mcleod Ganj
into the rocks which was slightly underwhelming but worth the visit overall. As well as this I checked out the famous Chowpatty beach and Haji Ali mosque-the latter famous for being built across a causeway, which at high tide means it gets cuts off and gives the effect of floating on the sea. The best visit I made was to the Dharavi slum, but sadly-or perhaps fittingly-you aren't allowed to take photographs so you have to rely on my inept explanations instead. Dharvi is the largest in Asia and the one made famous by Slumdog Millionaire, although personally I found the slum term almost derogatory as it is more a city within a city and different to those I have seen in Johannesburg or Rio. It is true that there are over 1 million people crammed into just 2 square kilometres and the narrow sewer lined alleyways lead you through tiny houses piled on top of each other. But the slum also has an industry section with people having trades and businesses, so much so that the slum has a turnover of US$665million. People pay rent and bills, have electricity and kitchens, and the homes range from shacks to multi-storey
Drinking whiskey with locals
concrete structures. There are schools,hospitals and even a gym(I was tempted to pop in and show them how it's done but it was very hot, I didn't want to cramp). Anyway, the term slum is only applied because the land is technically owned by the government and not the people living there so it was more like a suburb or something. Overall it was a fascinating visit and highly recommended.

Jerry Springer style final thoughts:

And so that's India done, 5 weeks in all which in a way has only just scratched the surface. If I had longer I would visit Ladakh, Darjeeling and more of South India, but overall I feel as though I have been here long enough and seen enough of a cross section of India to understand this diverse country. Or understand it as much as one can. I have known a lot of people who have been here and all have given me horror stories listing a million bad things about the place, but they always ended with a positive vibe and said to just go and do it and that it wouldn't disappoint. And now I understand what they mean, it is
Cute kids in village
such a conundrum and contradiction of country that you either love it, hate it or feel both in equal measure.

For a start it is very humid but also gets torrential monsoons, the litter is appalling, the smells gut wrenching, the cities are overpopulated, the people in places are just downright mercenary and horrible, the poverty is disgraceful as the rich get richer whilst those that are born poor die even worse off, corruption is rife and religious tensions seem ready to surface at any moment. And sadly I can't see any these things changing anytime in the next few generations. But as with people before me I still encourage others to go, it is simply too fascinating and beguiling a country to be missed. The people in India (outside the golden triangle)are friendly and helpful, and I have not feared for my safety or felt in danger here. Everywhere you look there are elements of history and culture, be it British, Muslim, Portuguese, French etc, yet Indians still manage to maintain their own culture and way of life, as well as their spirituality and religion. And of course the food is mouth watering and delicious, with the greatest
Village houses around Manali
aspect being the variety that each region brings to ensure that it never gets boring. My favourite aspect of India is its diversity, I have never been to a country where each region or state is so unique and different. It's size is more like a continent and so each of the 28 states is like an individual country with different people, languages, food and culture etc, you could spend a lifetime travelling India and discover something new each time to step off a train or bus. It makes for a travelling experience like no other. India is a place to feel and experience, to absorb and try to take in-although with so much going in front of you it is a true assault to your senses as your eyes and ears are on overload. It is a place that inspires and challenges the imagination, a country that can at the same time time lead to soul searching or be soul destroying, in a way it is a country to visit and just survive.

And survive I did, despite being warned against it the monsoon was weak this year and I only saw one real day of incessant rain.
Trekking in mountains-Manali
I have only been ill once-a severe bout of stomach issues that lasted about 12hours-which suggests that the dreaded Delhi belly isn't so bad, or I may have just been lucky. India is definitely cheap, a good meal and drink can be had in a restaurant for under £3, transport is efficient and with prices that would make British rail weep. Accommodation is good and the only real expense, but at roughly £10 per night it is manageable. Aside from those first few days-which I now attribute as much to culture shock as much as delhi being menacing-the trip has been great,I am so glad that I stuck it out and can't believe I lasted 5 weeks because after 5 days I was ready to come home as it was all too much. This was as much down to those back home who I cant thank enough for helping me through when I was at my lowest and kept me going, it won't be forgotten. Now to start planning 2013! Until the next time people.

If u are looking for a big cat then Tadoba in Nagpur is a place to be. There are many big Tiger reserve in India, but the population of Big cat has gone down over years. Tadoba is one place where the ratio per sq km is quiet high. and u really need to have a very bad day, not to see one.

One thing to ensure book your safari in advance, and Maharuli is the gate to be .......the other gates have good number of wild life......but the chance to see the king himself is less.

Elephanta Caves
Happy (belated) Independence Day everyone! (Indian Independence Day) You probably would have thought that I would be out enjoying some parade or some activities to celebrate, but actually the government has put out a high warning alert for the country! Pretty sad that this day is marked by potential danger, but what to do. Anyways, it feels like a lifetime since I've written on this blog, so if you're reading here, prepare yourself for a lllooooonnnngggg one. I actually don't have internet right now (seems to be a regular occurrence), so this might be posted a little later (ok so it's almost a week later). I'm currently sitting in my living room, watching Indian MTV, which I've discovered is quite entertaining! I have barely watched any live tv since being here, but I think I like this more than just watching my shows on the internet (which I do too much of by the way… ugh, need to stop)!

Anyways, I think the last time I wrote (I'm just guessing here, because I can't check since I don't have internet) I talked about our trip to Khandala where I met a lot of great people from the Social Service League.
Elephanta Caves
Just as a recap it was a 'team building workshop' at the St. Xavier's villa in Khandala, where I met a lot of my friends and got to take a little break from the city. It was in a beautiful hill station that was cool and green, a great getaway and beautiful during the monsoon season if you ever get a chance to go! I've been keeping track of events and thoughts on my 'notes' app on my phone as much as possible, so I remember to talk about them here, so hopefully that will help. The first note I wrote since my last blog post was something like this: It's really easy to ignore the poverty here. That's what everyone else does. How are you supposed to live your life and enjoy it when faced with such problems everyday? People have minimal acknowledgement of these large issues that face their society because it's so draining for regular people to care so much everyday (of course there are amazing people around, such as the great students I've met in the SSL who dedicate their time and energy to making a difference, but I'm just talking about the general population.) Also
Elephanta Caves
you have to keep in mind that most of the population is affected by these large scale issues, with little resources to do anything about it, so they may be too distracted to take action (I think I read somewhere that around 55% of the population in Mumbai lives in the slums…) We are not faced with as many issues in the western world (but I wonder if we were, would we react the same?) If we could open people's eyes here and create a realization or implement the viewpoint of the rest of the world here, I wonder if that would make a difference. So that got really serious really fast, but it was just on my mind…

Anyways, to lighten the mood, there was a naked french man dancing around my living room last weekend. Hahaha I guess I'll have to explain that one. I decided to have people over on the fourth, and some of the french exchange students at my school came as well. We were playing beer pong when suddenly I hear a bunch of french guys singing and Guillaume, who was our opponent, starting stripping! He even did a dance, and that was
Train Boys
Boy hanging out the side of the ladies first class compartment, a usual sight.
probably one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time. Everyone except me and the other french guys just happened to find something really interesting the kitchen and ran away there, maybe I should have too but… nahhhh! Anyways that song they were singing apparently is sung a lot in french universities, and whichever guy the song is sung to, they have to strip! Just one more reason for me to love the French haha. I've been out (or stayed in) with friends quite a bit since the last time I wrote, for example, we've been to Ladies Night at Lagerbay a couple of times, which serves free drinks for ladies from 8-11 on Tuesdays. These nights obviously have been pretty awesome, even just to hang with the girls (though the boys will often crash). There's also been hilarious karaoke nights, but I think it just comes down to the company you're with, so cheers to all my Indian friends!

I've also had some daytime adventures, including a trip to the Elephanta Caves on Elephanta island, which is about a 1hour ferry ride away from the Gateway of India. I went with my friend Arnaud, a french exchange student in one of my classes. Even as the trip started out, we were facing obstacles haha. I had a few train mishaps (which never happens to me just going to college!), where there were SO many people that I couldn't even get on the train! Then apparently I took a weird train and had to take another one, which I couldn't get onto the first time either (on the ladies first class compartment too, which normally is pretty empty compared to the other compartments.) Then we got on the ferry and it seemed to be a nice day, but weather is really unpredictable here so of course it started raining. No problem, we moved below deck. We got to the island, hired a nice tour man named Nitin and saw the lovely caves. I was a little skeptical about getting a tour guide at first, because I've read reviews saying that you don't need one, but I'm glad we had one to explain the different meanings of different sculptures, poses, etc. Since I'm taking a couple of courses in ancient indian culture, it was easier to relate to and quite interesting. There were also really cute monkeys, and our tour guide showed us his home on the island, which was quite a nice experience. I'm pretty sure he ripped us off a little but I think that's to be expected. So we left thinking we'd had a nice experience, but that was hardly the end. On the ferry back, it started POURING. It was raining harder than I'd ever seen it rain since getting here, of course it happened the one time we happened to be on a boat! We were soaked all the way through, the boat was bouncing up and down like a amusement park ride, people were puking all over the place, and then finally they couldn't drop us off at the same place we left, so we got off at some random dock in the middle of nowhere. We couldn't find any taxi's so we ended up trekking to the closest train station in the rain, hoping we were going in the right direction. By the time I got home all I wanted to do was sleeeep, it was exhausting. Of course when I told my nana this story he told me that I was making very bad choices and I should stay in my apartment at all times, but no regrets!

On a less fun note, we had mid-term exams a few weeks ago, which was just brutal. They were 50 minutes each where we had to write as much as possible, and in the cases of my ancient indian culture exams, I really had no idea what was going on. We still haven't received our marks, but unfortunately I don't have really high hopes, I guess we'll just see. I really, really do not like the education here. I don't know if it's the atmosphere, but even the academics seem simpler and uninteresting, though the professors seem quite involved in the learning process. Everything about it is just so high school.

Anyways, as for other random experiences, I listened to the song 'Chaiyya Chaiyya' on the train (bollywood song from the 90's) which I thought was pretty cool, I had to refrain from breaking out in dance ahaha. Have I mentioned that in some compartments men will sit and sing songs or do pujas? Kind of cool but pretty annoying if you're sitting in the next compartment for half an hour (my train time to college.)

Okay, I'm going to end this post here, and continue on in the next post. I still have lots to write so hopefully it will be soon! Cheers everyone.

Bhopal - the Taj-ul-Masjid
I caught an evening sleeper train from Varanasi which arrived at Bhopal at 8am the next morning. I had decided to stop for a while in Bhopal mainly to break the journey from Varanasi to Mumbai so I had booked two separate sleeper trains to do the journey. Bhopal is the site of the Taj-ul-Masjid mosque, designed at it's inception to be the largest mosque in the world. It was started by one of Bhopal's three female rulers in 1877 but she died before it was finished.

Before heading towards the Taj-ul-Masjid I had put my large rucksack into the left luggage storage department at Bhopal railway station. Left luggage at railway stations is a very useful and cheap facility - usually only 10 rupees for up to 24 hours - when back-packing and you want to explore a place without carrying round your heavy pack all day. Rules vary at different stations however. At Bhopal you are allocated a large tin locker but you need to provide your own padlock to secure it. At Mumbai's Victoria Terminus your luggage is just put on a shelf but before you can hand it over you have to take it to a
Bhopal - fishermen in the larger of the two lakes
police security post to have it x-ray scanned, collect a receipt and take it back to the luggage office and show your passport.

Unfortunately when I left my backpack at Bhopal railway station, I omitted to take out a pair of long trousers. When I arrived at the Taj-ul-Masjid in shorts I was not allowed in! However, even from the outside I could see that it was a very large impressive building, both the mosque itself and the fortress-like building that surrounds it.

As I was leaving the mosque, the rain started and the rest of the day was a complete washout. I walked around a bit to have a look at the lake views - Bhopal is built between two lakes - then headed back towards the railway station to sit and read in the upper class waiting room until my next train arrived at about 6pm. I awoke the next morning in Mumbai's enormous Victoria Terminus railway station, a product of the British Raj and now a protected monument. I now had two full days in Mumbai before my flight was due to leave in the early hours of Wednesday morning,

After finding a hotel
Mumbai - The Gateway Of India
for one night, showering and changing, I took a taxi down to the harbour area at the south-eastern end of Mumbai. Here, facing the Arabian Sea, there is a large archway known as the Gateway of India which was built to celebrate the visit to India of the British King George V and Queen Mary in 1911. About 50 to 100 yards away is Mumbai's most prestigious hotel, the Taj Mahal Palace. After wandering around the harbour area for a while, I walked back in the direction of Victoria Terminus where there are numerous British Raj-era buldings. From Victoria Terminus I then walked west towards Marine Drive, the long road and sea embankment that marks Mumbai's south western edge. I followed Marine Drive all the way north to Chowpatty, Mumbai's beach, where a short stretch of sand encouraged a few hardy souls to swim in the Arabian Sea. By now the rain had set in again and walking along Marine Drive with the bracing wind, sea spray and rain reminded me of similar days as a child on holiday at Bridlington on Yorkshire's East Coast!

Further north I stopped to have a look at Haji Ali's Mosque which is
Mumbai - The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel
built on a rock a couple of hundred yards off-shore and connected to the mainland by a long low-lying causeway. With today's weather, however, it was not going to be sensible to try and walk out to the mosque so instead I headed off next towards the Mahalaxmi Dhobi Ghat, an area of Mumbai where most of the population are engaged in laundry work, and where most of Mumabi's hotels and hospitals send their laundry to be done by dbobi-wallahs. These laundry workers work outdoors washing the linen by hand using hundreds of purpose-built concrete wash pens. Despite the fact that it was still raining heavily, some washing was still going on.

The next morning I checked out of my hotel and took a taxi back to Victoria Terminus where I put my large rucksack into the left luggage store so I could spend the rest of the day exploring more of Mumbai. I walked back down to the harbour area first. Most of Mumbai is built on a peninsula which creates a bay in the Arabian Sea. In this bay are a number of islands, the largest of which is called Elephanta Island. Because there are some important
Chowpatty - Mumbai's beach
carvings in caves on this island, there are a number of boats which ply backwards and forwards between the dock at the side of the Gateway of India and Elephanta Island. The boat trip takes about an hour each way and even if you don't visit the caves, the return boat trip is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours enjoying a sea breeze on a sultry day (today it wasn't raining!). I spent the afternoon doing some present shopping for friends and family before finding a taxi to take me to the airport in the early evening. The taxi ride from Victoria Terminus to the International airport took just over two hours in nose-to-tail traffic.

After completing my first visit to India, I can say that I am glad to have had the opportunity to see some iconic sights, to get a feel for life in Indian cities, and to get to know a bit about the country's magnificent railway network. However, this first visit packed 7 cities into 15 days and very little else in between. On reflection I think I should have tried to give myself some respite in non-city environments as well. Indian
Mumbai - Haji Ali's Mosque
cities are crowded, noisy and seemingly chaotic, and I am definitely citied-out for the time being. When I return to India, which I am sure I will, I will plan to see much more of village and rural life, some mountain areas and coastal areas. However, my next planned trip, for Easter 2013, is to go back to Nepal and this time do a mountain trekking holiday. Watch this space.

Undertakers with double careers as ambulance drivers or sculptors. Wallahs – those who make tea are chaiwallahs; those who make dresses are dresswallahs, and those who fix flat tires are puncturewallahs, to name a few. The precision with which water is poured into mouths from cups held inches above parted lips. Fingertips impervious to heat that can grab a roti fresh off the fire without flinching, theatrically tossing it between their hands, or panting, “Hot! Hot! Hot!” Toenails that are filed into luxuriously painted daggers. Great teeth shown off by great smiles. Babies wearing bangles. Cardamom.

One side of entire conversations can be carried out using various intonations of Hanh. Nai, na? The unique Indian usage of the English language that allows for such grammatical gems as unless and until, the salt is lesser, the both of you all, and wait there only. Your name is not just your name, but your good name. Plastic bags are called polythene.

excuse or apology. Cabs turn their engine off at every red light. Unmanned metal detectors stand sentinel at every train station. Small, hand-turned Ferris wheels. Sidewalk shaves for men. Lines that move in from the sides, not the back. Satyamev Jayate. 1.2 billion people. The constant confusion over how many zeros are in a lakh (5), how many are in a crore (7) and how it all translates into thousands and millions. The acceptance of life as it is.

And one final story to demonstrate why India is great... I had 72 hours left in the country, 34 of which would be spent in a train to Kolkata. Upon arriving at CST, I realized that I had lost my ticket somewhere along the way to the station. The rules are such that, even in the case of theft, one must put in a special request to the Station Master to reprint the ticket and pay half of its original cost (which is actually an example of why India isn’t so great, but that’s beside the point). I didn’t have the cash to pay the penalty and began to bemoan my fate. With few options and the minutes until my
Merry-Go-Round
departure quickly ticking away, the employees at the station pooled their money together until they had gathered the necessary amount, and then some. Without a word, they put the ticket and the extra cash into my hand and sent me on my way. To say that I will miss this country is an understatement.

VT/CST
Like most things in Bombay/Mumbai, the terminal stop of the Central Railway has two names: Victoria Terminus and/or Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.
Bombay. Mumbai. The city of seven islands, and even more names. Legend has it that when the Portuguese first anchored their ships in the natural harbor created by a series of mangrove-covered islands off India’s western coast, they called the area Bom Bahia, the good port. Anyone with a working knowledge of the Portuguese language can tell you that there’s a discrepancy between the masculine adjective and the feminine noun in this name, but so the story goes. Throughout its long history, the island city has additionally been known as Mamba Raksasha, Manbai, Mambe, Mumbadevi, Bambai, and countless other names, until 1995, when the native Maharashtrians christened it Mumbai. But everyone I met still calls it Bombay. Forgive me if I follow suit.

There’s nothing I can say about Bombay that hasn’t already been said (better). There’s no justice I can serve the maximum city with simple words. Descriptions can only take you so far. Bombay is a city that has to be experienced firsthand; it has to be felt (dozens of bodies crushed against you in the train), to be breathed in (exhaust of rush hour traffic) and sweated out (in rivulets down your back on muggy afternoons). It’s
Veggie Vendor
a city of extremes that evokes similar emotions. Love it or hate it – or as is sometimes the case, love it just as vehemently as you hate it – there’s no in between.

As for me, it was love at first sight, or rather love at first lack of a hassle. I rolled in on an overnight train from Delhi, preparing myself for the horde of drivers who normally wait like vultures for dying prey at the exits of train stations. But there was no one there. Sure, the station was full of the normal hurried commuters and bedraggled beggars, but none of them were in my face or trying to fleece me. I had to go out to the road and actively look for a rickshaw. The first two I flagged down even denied me! I finally found a driver willing to take me to Yari Road and tried to negotiate a price with him – but he wouldn’t have it. Not because he had a fixed number in mind that a girl so white as myself should pay, but because all the rickshaws in Bombay run on meters. I loved not having to haggle. I didn’t
Gateway to India
even mind that he drove me around in a few circles, lost – the disorientation and its accompanying apology were genuine.

But there was more I loved about Bombay than metered rickshaws. I loved its similarity to Costa Rica: the bright red flowers of the May tree in full bloom; the tropical air heavy with impending rain; the sea breeze that made the humidity bearable, and the possibilities to go salsa dancing. I loved the echo of its colonial past: impeccable accents, imperial buildings of domes and spires and vine-covered English estates with flaking facades and battered balustrades. And I loved that there was a Cinnabon facing the sea on Carter Road – globalization never tasted so sweet! But what I loved most about Bombay was that in a city full of people living in less than human conditions, it had an incredible humanity.

Home to 21 million people, Bombay falls just short of being the most populous city in the world (that honor goes to Shanghai with 23 million inhabitants), but with an average of 20,000 people per packed square kilometer, it takes the cake for the world’s most densely populated city (Shanghai has plenty of space
Railroad Slum
to stretch with only 3,600 people/km2). The key word in the previous sentence is average. With roughly 65%!o(MISSING)f the city’s inhabitants crammed into less than 10%!o(MISSING)f its total area, the amount of human beings in one square kilometer in Bombay is much closer to 30,000. While these numbers translate into a social service catastrophe, they also form the basis for a community the likes of which I haven’t witnessed anywhere else in the world.

What I saw in the streets of Bombay were people who have nothing, but who share everything, unconditionally and indiscriminately. I saw people who care for the old, the sick and the weak. And I saw people who are tolerant and respectful, even when they aren’t shown the same tolerance or respect. One afternoon while walking through a slum by the railroad tracks, I had an urge to push aside the plastic sheet marking the entrance to a hut and beg to be taken in. I wanted to be a part of it. I wanted to be amongst people who work hard for a pittance, then give it all to their families with a smile. I wanted to climb a rickety ladder to
Another Sidewalk Occupant
reach my 3rd story hovel and watch the children running around naked and barefoot below me. I wanted to listen to the gossiping of the old women squatting in the lanes. I wanted them to teach me how to live, to really live, in the moment and happy with whatever the world brings my way.



Contrary to popular belief, homelessness isn’t a problem in Bombay – everyone has a home, even if it’s only a three-meter swath of sidewalk. In the endless battle for space, families fight with street dogs (all of whom are fatter than their human counterparts), tea stalls and stacks of spare tires to secure an area to call home. Used as living quarters, there’s no room left for the footpaths to serve their intended purpose as pedestrian pathways. Instead, everyone walks on the road. On certain miraculously unoccupied sidewalks, people still prefer to brave the shadeless, congested roads rather than walk on sidewalks composed of loose bricks, excrement (human and dog alike) and dead rats in varying stages of decay. During the monsoon, a lack of proper drainage turns these same sidewalks into veritable lakes of urine, feces and rat carcass. And, therein,
Street Dog
lies the real problem of Bombay, the lack of proper sanitation facilities, waste disposal, and clean water.

After two weeks in Bombay, I was invited to go for a run on Juhu beach at six in the morning. Many people might consider this an indecent proposal, but I was stoked. I hadn’t been running in five months, and I hadn’t been running on a beach in even longer. I was so excited that the night before I kept waking up in half-hour intervals, Is it time yet? At 4:50, I couldn’t take it any longer. I got up, got ready and grabbed a rickshaw to the beach. The first light of day fell on a sight I wasn’t prepared for. Waves of waste splashed against the beach, if it could be called that. It was where the sea met the land, but I wasn’t sure there was any sand beneath all the empty plastic bags and bottles, the discarded corncobs, the rotting puja flowers and stranded shoes. It wasn’t a place where you’d ever want to walk barefoot and you definitely wouldn’t want to splash in the refuse-tainted waters. At both ends of the beach, lines of men squatted
Trash Beach
in the shallow surf making deposits, their stink blowing in with the sea breeze. It was exactly the type of sight that makes Westerners cringe at the mere mention of India, then go wash their hands in their germ-free bathrooms. I won’t lie. I too cringed, and turned up my nose. Then I got over it and accepted the reality of Bombay, my affection for the city wholly unaffected.



Another reality of Bombay is that with so many people who have so little, labor comes cheap. As a member of the middle class, you have the luxury of never having to do anything for yourself, if you should so choose. You can afford to have someone cook your meals, another person clean your floors, and yet another person drive your car. You can even afford to have a personal assistant of sorts, a person known as a “man.” Need to deliver some important papers? No worries, just send your man. “Stay there, my man is coming.” Other peoples’ men are likewise sent to you. Everything can be delivered directly to your front door – even a single cigarette. With people coming and going on various errands all
Middle Class
day, the doorbell becomes a common background noise in the middle class homes of Bombay.

Besides a constantly ringing doorbell, the middle class of Bombay suffer many of the same inconveniences as those in the slums, just not to the same degree. Running water and electricity can be shut off at any time, without any notice, for any length of time. Buildings crumble, ceilings cave-in, paint peels, elevators malfunction, and worms find their way into the bathrooms of fourth floor flats. Things are shoddily repaired to ensure the future work of repairing it again. And of course, space. Space is always an issue in Bombay. With essentially 20,000 neighbors, privacy doesn’t exist. Every window has a view into the window of the opposite flat, rendering it impossible to walk around naked in your living room (sorry, Alanis).

The only exception I found to this phenomenon (besides the high-rise apartments of the super-rich that line the trendy seashore promenades and the plastic-lined huts of the super-poor that line its rocky shores) was the home of my CS hosts in Santa Cruz. Their windows looked out onto the training field of the nearby police academy. In the mornings, uniformed cadets
No Privacy
lined up to perform synchronized drills. In the afternoons, rummaging pigs and dogs took over the grounds. And in the evenings, it was overrun by street kids playing football (or, for my American brethren, soccer). Men ride by on rusty bikes and women stroll past with bags of vegetables, their saris fluttering in the gentle breeze. A small group of young boys forms just below the kitchen window. They take turns dropping their pants. The other boys poke sticks at their friend’s exposed member, mentally judging it against their own. It seems that boys will be boys, the world over. And for a moment, looking out the window, you forget that you’re in the middle of a teeming city.

Maybe I haven’t painted the prettiest picture of Bombay. Maybe you won’t be rushing to buy a ticket on the next plane here. But, you’re really missing out if you never give it a chance. Bombay is more than the sum of its filthy parts. It’s a city of dreams and disappointments, of riches and waste. It’s a city of many contradictions and few answers or explanations. There’s no denying that it’s dirty. It’s filled with poverty and too many
Open Field
people – but it’s alive. And beautiful in all of its squalor. With an infectious optimism and resolution, Bombay has taught me how to be comfortable in a crowd, and allowed me to see humanity in a whole new light. It may be that the city suffers from a severe case of Multiple Personality Disorder, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get to know it. Just like with people, the best ones are often the crazy ones. And, like I’m fond of saying, everything is worth a try – at least twice.

From the unknown millions to the handful of special souls who took me in and showed me around, Bombay would be nothing if it weren’t for its people. So, while I’m always grateful to the people who touch my life during my travels, I feel especially compelled to thank the beautiful Bombayites who’ve shared their city with me over the past month. To Chris, Capucine, Junaid, Jodot, Pankaj and Kim, thank you for giving me a place to rest my head, an ear to share my stories and endless avenues of entertainment. And a special thanks goes out to Umber and Zarine for teaching me how to
Home
accept compliments (even if I haven’t quite perfected the technique yet); thank you for all the compliments. But, more than that, thank you for so wholeheartedly adopting me into your lives. I love you guys. You will be greatly missed.



*The title of this blog comes from a book of the same name by Suketu Mehta. I highly recommended it for those interested in reading more about behind-the-scenes Bombay.

July 1st 2012
Published: July 1st 2012


View from our Apartment
Here's a panoramic view from a window in our apartment onto the street!
Happy Canada Day everyone! I've been looking at pictures of friends on Facebook, mostly in Canada, some elsewhere (my best friend is in Scotland and has been posting some lovely pictures-- hey girl!), and I've come to the conclusion that things seem so easy there compared to here! I think I mentioned in my last post that I was feeling constantly tired; when I think about how busy it is here (the time I spend concentrating on my security, the constant traffic and people, exchanging prices, breathing polluted air) I think it's understandable that compared to India, I find Canada is much calmer.

We were supposed to have a Canada Day celebration at our place yesterday, then maybe head out to continue the party, but a few hours before people came over we found out it was a dry day!! Meaning there is no sale of alcohol in the city... Maaaaaan I'm still not even 100% sure why, but that sure put a damper on things. Instead, Jonny and I walked around Bandra a bit and sat by the water, nice enough. The other day though I was invited to a Canada Day celebration by the Canadian consulate in Mumbai, so Erin (another girl on the OMG program) and I headed to the very fancy, 5-star, Trident Hotel. The exchange coordinator at my school, Father Roy, invited us but no one checked our identity or anything! It was one fancy event, with businessmen, politicians, and who knows who else. There was a free dinner, drinks, and a show by Shiamak Davar and his group! Now I definitely want to work at a Canadian consulate if I get to go to parties like that. So that was fun, we got to dance on stage (I just have to mention the very goodlooking dancers from the troupe) and we even met some other Canadians there! Afterwords I met up with Jonny and some of his friends from Jai Hind College at some dingy bar, which was a drastic change from where I was haha, but equally as fun (minus the lizards on the wall...)! Goes to say I didn't go to class the next day. However, I did have to go to class the next day, a Saturday, because there's class on Saturdays! So shit, I hate that and I hate waking up early every day to go to class. I wonder if you have to wake up early if you work at a consulate... I decided if that doesn't work out, I could try and open a animal shelter here in India, because goodness knows they could use a few. Seeing the cats and dogs around here is SO sad, it's shame that it's become a normal part of living here.

Anyways, I can't do anything about that now, however I have started with the Social Service League at my school to make at least a little bit of a difference while I'm here. I figure I should help out on a more local level before trying to help make a difference on an international level, because it's actions like this by so many around the world that help to make a huge difference. So far I've been asked to help out with this program called Project Care that is currently in the works. The people in the SSL at my school are amazing people, and they're all young people working really hard to make a difference. It's often a struggle, because the bureaucracy here is ridiculously unorganized, so kudos to them for attempting to make it through all that. I've also signed up to go on a weekend workshop next weekend with them up at some hill station a bit out of the city which should be super fun!

Some other experiences I've had here is eating pizza with paneer on it, seeing a monkey in a train station (did I mention that already?), and riding on the back of a motorbike! There are soooo many bikes here, and it was super fun to ride (but I would never be able to do it myself in Mumbai, I can hardly cross the road lol). On another note, I thought I'd mention that you can order McDonald's here and have it delivered (hahaha funny things too, like Aloo McTikki and stuff), or stuff from the pharmacy (imagine Shoppers Drug Mart delivered), which is sooooo convenient! Also, it's really weird but I've been so many brown doppelgängers of people I know! For example, I've made a friend in my history class, Jinx, who reminds me so much of my friend Jaaved from back home (ok so they're both brown but still), and one of Jonny's friends from Jai Hind looks so much like my friend Lisa from France, and today I met a South African who looks a lot like Javid from Ottawa!

Anyways people, I'm off to bed, as I've mentioned I've been quite tired since being here. Happy Canada Day once again!

Mumbai to Kolhapur On Road
somwhere in April, Nikhil my nephew, suggested that we should go out for a picnic in June.June b'use he was going to be free and wanted to enjoy before he starts his final year.Initially i thought it to be a passing thought.Never did i anticipated that it will be so eagerly awaited and so much discussed and planned trip of recent times for all of us!!Nikhil/me/Nam/Mai were constantly in touch with each other on reservations from that time till actual date of travel.Nick visited us few times just to discuss and plan.That level of enthusiam was amazing!!It actually drew me closer and got me more and more involved as we approached the day of travel.Nam was as usual intensely busy in packing since we were travelling such a long distance by car with Sai for the first time.

All that pre travel interactioned ensured that we had our stay reservations confirmed at all key places where we were going to have the overnight stay.We booked at Margaon,Goa at LIC Guest House and then at Tarkarli at MTDC resorts. Me & Mai have submitted a weeks leave at our offices.Nikhil and Mai came down to our place on Saturday 9th June
@ Opal Hotel,Kolhapur
around 8.30 am. We quickly wound up and started our journey by 9.15 am. This was our first outing together as a family for such a extended period.We all were excited with the prospects!!Another good thing was Me & Nick both knew driving so it was going to be easy on each other.No single person was required to drive thruout which is tiring!!

We zeroed out on Mumbai Bangalore highway as our route that takes us thru Pune - Satara to Kolhapur where we had planned to halt for overnight stay. Our first halt came at Pune where we stopped at a hotel..dont recall the name but it was highway only.I drove from Pune to Satara where we took the 2nd at a roadside hotel. Had some hot vadapav, Bhajiyas and tea. All 3 were had amazing taste.Nikhil then took over from me till Kolhapur. By 6 pm..in day time we reached Kolhapur. For overnight stay, we first went to Hotel Opal which was preferred choice given its reputation but unfortunately for us, it was all booked. Hence as alternate, we then checked in at Kohinoor Square which was not too far from there. In fact it was closer
Sunset from Panhalgad,Kolhapur
to Ambabai Mandir.Apprently that hotel chain is managed by Ex CM Manohar Joshi.Hotel was decent.I think it had very good infrastructure but could be maintained better.We booked 2 adjucent rooms.After checking in, got refreshed...took bath and went out for Dinner at Opal Hotel Restaurant.Kolhapur is world famous for Panhala,Rankala and food.In Food 2 local delicacies are Tambda Rassa and Pandhra Rassa.We had both in our order for the dinner that night.Its basically chicken soup - One with spice and one without.But one has to taste it if they are in Kolhapur. After a good dinner, we strolled around the hotel,took some snaps at the varanda and then returned back to the hotel for bed.

Next day Sunday was booked for local siteseeing. Among the alternatives, we choose Panhala and Tope Chinmay Ganesh. But first we decided to seek the blessings of Kolhapurchi Ambabai. Her temple was hardly 10 mins away from our hotel.We hired auto from the road across and went to the temple. Being Sunday morning,there was rush. Considering the crowd, we decided to go the short cut way ie mukhdarshan from a distance i/o waiting in the queue.After seeking her blessings, we went out and had some
From Kolhapur to Goa
good sugarcane juice.For those who are not aware, Kolhapur-Satar belt is home to biggest and the best sugarcane factories in India.Ladies indulged in some local shopping while me and Nick waited patiently outside the shops. From there we went back to hotel, picked up the car and were on our way to Panhala. Panhala fort most famous for escape of Shivaji Maharaj from Siddhi Johar is a great fort which still remains in decent condistions as witness to great Maratha history.Iam saying decent conditions b'use except Raigad ie Capital fort of Maratha Kingdom, we will read in press and medie that most of the other forts are maintained poorly. Here its not that State Govt has done anything extraordinary but they have certainly done some good things. 2 things I can think of is Tabak Udyan which a garden maintained at the mouth of vally within the fort and the way they have encourged local people to set up their food shops and stalls for the visitors. Notable amongst them are the ones which are governed by Women's committee.Dont miss to have your lunch there with some freshly prepared bhakri and spicy zunka.Tabak udyan is one garden which is very
@ Amboli Mahadevgad Point
well designed and maintained. One has step down almost 50-75 steps to reach its base and then there are wonderful pathways that lead to the vally view.Beware of monkeys there though!!After spending some good time at Panhala we started driving towards Tope Chinmay Ganesh. It was longer than what i thought initially.Cinmay Ganesh is a 85 feet Lord Ganesh idol built by Chinmay Trust of South India. They believe is worship of Lord Ganesha and have built similer temples across india. One at Tope is probably the biggest in India and the world. Located on a small hilltop close to the Mumbai Bangalore highway,its a nicely maintained temple on top of which the idol sits.The surroundings are so peaceful that no one wish to leave and so did we. Fortunately for us, we also got to attend his Arti at the evening. One thing that strikes you at that place is the simplicity of place and serenity of the surroundings.I enjoyed that peaceful time there after long travel that we had been thru in last 2 days!! We left from there.It was almost sunset time. Dinner plan for that night was a place called ""Phadtare Misal Kendra"".But we did managed
Amboli
to find it ..thanks to I Phone Maps, but after reaching we came to know that its open only from morning to noon. Hence at last minute we have to change our plans.We went to Restaurant of Hotel Panchshil instead and had routine continental food.Hotel has strong Wifi signals.Me & Nick were following French Open Final that night between Nadal and Djoker which Nadal finally won next day.

Next day we checkout from Kohinoor Square.Before taking the highway, we thought of trying our luck with Ambabai templ e and it worked. Less rush so we easily got the chance to offer prayers from the main dome.We did that and started our journey towards Margaon, Goa.Nick was our guide in this phase.He was thoroughly aware routes,where to eat, what to see.he took us thru Amboli.It was drizzling and at times raining heaviliy.All in all quiet a plesant journey from Kolhapur to Amboli.At Amboli, we stopped at MTDC Resorts for lunch.We ordered Chicken Vade for all and what a delicious food it was!!Simply melts in your mouth.By the time cook prepared the food, Nick took us around the resorts.We didnt had time but if we had, I really would have liked
Panhalgad Fort,Kolhapur
to stay there.Such a amazing place it was!!Post lunch we thought we had just enough time to cover one of the points at Amboli. Nick suggested Mahadevgad.And it was worth it. Road to the point from the main road is quiet bumpy but once you reach the destination, you will forget that.

The route that we took for goa from Kolhapur was from Amboli.Nikhil knew all the routes as if he is a localite.It was of great help to us. The travel happened with minimum need for direction.He even knew what to see and where to eat!!For lunch he took the halt at MTDC Resorts at Amboli.We ordered non veg lunch.As the mean was getting cooked, we explored the property.We didnt had time but this place is on for our next visit to Malvan.and what a delicious lunch it was!!Do make it a point to halt here and have food!!we had limited time and lot do points to visit.Finally in the interest of time, we decided to do what Nikhil suggested.ie Mahadevgadh point.A few kilometers away from the main road,approach road is quiet bumpy.careful of bees on the way.Keep the window glass closed.Once you reach the point, you will
Panhala Fort,Kolhapur
be mersmirised by the bounty of nature.Cool breeze welcomes you.Vally view all across.Great location for landscape snap!!It was overcast for most time when we were there.So was nice being there and enjoy the nature.After filling our lungs with fresh air, we continued our journey to Goa from there.Via Sawantwadi-Terekhol-Panji we reached Margaon late in evening.Had some showers in Sawantwadi but in Goa,it was again overcast but not raining.Last leg of the travel from Panji to Margaon was actually tiring and endless wait.Directions to our guesthouse were not clear to us.Hence we have to ask many folks and funny part was,each one we asked will ell us in their own unique style.e.g Some lady guided us saying that we have to ""Straightaway"" and not straight!!Someone actually us not to ask anyone!!Funny little things!FInally we found the place and got inn by 9.30 pm.Before retiring to bed, we had the worst dinner of the tour at a nearby hotel La Marina.Name sounds like its a big one but food was equally bad.Surprising thing was Sai is the only one who ate there among all 5 of us.Aviod La Marina in Margaon.Its near the Market area.

In Goa, we had planned for
Panhalgad Garden,Kolhapur
3 places..Doodhsagar Waterfalls/Spice Garden visit and Old Goa.Next day we got up after taking some good rest which meant that porposition to Doodhsagar was ruled out. I made some basic inquiries for the Spice in Ponda, some 35 km away and we decided to go there first and it was worth the visit.We reached the area in approx 90 mins.Post Ponda, it takes you towards the mountains.At the base of mountains, one can see sign boards for spice gardens.There are a few in that area.We zeroed out on one that we have called.Spice garden wont typically feature on the list of Goa visitors as its a bit of the track but folks who want to see Goa beyond beach and booze, its a great change.From the parking area, you walk down and then you have a nice wooden bridge.There is a water body beneth it but since monsoon has not started, there was not as much water as one would expect.At the entry, you are greeted with garlands by a staff who then guides you on your itinerary for the next hour.Welcome is also accompanied by some nice hot herbal tea to freshen you up.In next hour or so, you
Replica of Panhala
are guided thru a demo spice garden by a staff who will show you different spice plants and their uses in daily life.We got someone called ""Pappu"" and he was good at engaging visitors.Nam among us answered a few of his questions correctly on spices.Not that there were prizes for that but we all did got to experience something called ""Magic Waters"" at the end of that tour.Cold magical water running down your spine is a nice experience.The lunch that follows (which is also part of the package that you buy) is no less good.They keep a good combo of veg and non veg varieties and food is tasty too.One can watch Kingsisher and other variety of birds while you eat in their huts.Finally before checkout, you can buy spices and associated products from their shop at reasonable prices. In peak season, they also have option of having a Elephant bath for the visitors.Due to off season, it was not open.We did saw elephgants outside though!

After that nice experience we then turn our direction towards Old Goa.As many know, Goa was a Purtugese colony.Old goa is the area where they operated in their prime.Thus that area which has
Chinmay Ganadhish
remains of their part glory, is what Old Goa is all about.Its a World Heritage site by Unesco.And it does leave it upto its expectations as World Heritage Site.We didnt explored much but did visited a local museum which has some old arteffects and historical details of portugese regime on Goa.Nikhil suggested a Sugarcane juicewala.We went there, did some window shopping before starting our trip towards Panji.One thing that folks should do while in Goa is ensure that they fill up the petrol tanks of their cars.Petrol and booze are almost 25-40 % cheaper in Goa as state government dont levy any state taxes on both.Panji from Old goa is around 45 mins drive.Our destination was Baga beach.Coming to Goa and not visiting any beach is like going to Vegas and not visiting any Casino.Its the Prime attraction of that place and one must visit atleast one of the beaches in their goa trips.We reached there is mid evening.It was still an hour or so for sunset.It was high tide so waves were bigger and higher than otherwise.We though Sai will enjoy but exactly opposite happened.She was frightened of water like a mouse is of Cat.The moment we try to
Kohinoor Hotel, Kolhapur
put her down, she would scream.For some reason she is extremely afraid of water.Hence lot of fun has to be curtailed.We hence deciced to relax in the Shaks.The first one that came on our walk, we picked up a table there.It was nice experience enjoying the sunset in front of you on a beach with booze in your hand.You dont get to these every day!!Once the sun set and we finished the booze, we moved on for dinner.There was a good hotel on our way to beach that me & Nikhil have noticed.It turns out to be a really good one as we had our dinner there.A bit on expensive side but it was very good. Almost exclusive as we were the only one inn at that time in that hotel.Apprently its owned by Ex CM Narayan Rane.Funny part was the hotel that we intended to go was actually next door but we took this one for that,only to realise the goof up after we came out.But anyhow the dinner was delicious.Nikhil took us back in almost 1 hour from there, defying estimates by most of us.I think thats the fastest that he drive thruout that week with us!!
Kolhapur Souvenier

Next day was set for Doodhsagar Waterfalls.We actually got a little late start to the day.Per Iphone maps, it was indiacating that distance is around 95 kms & some weird long routes for some reason.We even went to the Margaon railway station and inquired for the train option but it turned out to be impractical.Thus finally we decided to continue and left guesthouse around 10.30 am.We were able to cover the distance of 80 odd kms in good time thru Ponda.The falls are closer to a place called ""Kolam"".At Kolam, there is a good resort by the name of ""Wild Mushroom"".Its nice property in the vicinity of ""Bhagwan Mahavir Sanctuary"" on Goa - Karnataka border.We took a halt there, had breakafast.For the ladies if they are travelling, this is a good place to get refreshed and get ready for the thrill ride that awaits the visitors to Doodhsagar.We learnt there that due to onset of monsoons, the jeep rides to the falls have been replaced with Pilot driven bikes.We still moved on.Upon reaching the base, we were welcomed by a group of young folks, we informed us about next things.It was a 15 km travel on bike with their pilot
Welcome @ Spice Garden, Fonda,Goa
for Rs500 per head.The road goes parallel to train track for almost 20 mins before you get off and pick up a jungle trail.Then from the dense jungle,its additional 35-40 mins before you reach the base area of falls.One has to pass thru couple of river flows inbetween.Good that its just a start to monsoons,otherwise I can imagine what a adventure it can be!.Not that it was any less for us especially with Sai with us. We hired 4 bikes for 4 of us.Sai was crying seeing new people around and we were equally worried. They did explained the travel but never did we anticipated that its going to be as adventourous as it turns out to be. Fortunately the pilots were good for both Nam and Mai which helped.We reached the falls after a thrilling bike ride and it started raining.We wait in the sheds hoping that it will slow down but there were no such signs.We had around an hour at the falls,hence finally me & nikhil started ahead as Mai And Nam with Sai waited on.From the base to the actual falls, one has to go thru all river flow,slippery stones.It was exiciting to be up and
Around Dudhsagar Waterfalls
so close one of the tallest waterfalls in india.We had a few blokes to accompany us at that time.One can relate to why it is called ""Doodhsagar"" ie Sea of Milk.The flow was not at its peak, but it was good enough to give us the thrill that we came here to experience.Nikhil knows swimming so he went straight in.Everybody else around us also went inn leaving me as only one out.The water was shallow but stones underneath slippery.Plus from the end from where they got in, it was just a few feets away from the actual fall.So I was afraid.But finally somehow all around helped and I plunged inn. Nikhil helped me get steady.We even went beneathe the falls which was awsome experience.We spent good 15-20 mins in there before coming out.The water was cold but not freezing cold.On our way back to the base,to our surprise we also met Mai, Nam with Sai.One of our pilots was very good at heart.He escorted both of them with them with Sai to a place from where they can see the falls.So even their hardship paid well.Slowly & cautiously we then returned to the base for another hour long bumpy bike
Wild Mushroom Resort,Kanranataka
ride.We to reached safely back car.It was thrilling for all of us that we did something like this.Undoubtedly the most cherished experience of this tour!!On the way back, we again took halt at Wild Mushroom Resorts.Ate,got
fresh and started our return journey.That night we ordered Pizza from nearby Dominos.Till bed time, we help but recall the thrill it was to be at Doodhsagar!!

Next day was Thursday-day 6 of our trip.Target was to reach Tarkarli via Vengurla.We left in good time, had breakfast at Monginis, had our petrol tank full and left for Vengurla.Again this time getting into familier territory, Nikhil turned as our guide.We stopped on the way at Vetoba's temple to offer our prayers before hitting vengurla for our lunch.Nikhil picked up one of best places in Vengurla.The place is called Hotel Gajali.Fantastic seaside views and equally good malvani food.It was amazing.No wonder why Nam felt like taking a nap post that when we went to Nick's uncle's house in Vengurla.Being native place, most of Nick's relatives have their own houses in Vengurla.We took some rest at his uncle's house.That evening we spent some time in meeting our relatives based out of Vengurla. When the sun was
Spice Garden, Fonda,Goa
about to set we started our travel towards Tarkarli. It was a long road and navigating thru dark was making it difficult.But Nikhil was on the wheels and we safely reached Tarkarli MTDC resorts by around 9 pm. It was rather late check in so we quickly placed our bags in our rooms and went to their open air restaurant for dinner. We all had tasty Chicken Wade.Only problem was flies as it has just rained.Fortunately for us none fell in our plates!!



MTDC Tarkarli has nicely placed on the seashore in a very wide area.Just 5 mins drive from the backwaters it is very well maintained for hygene & service.

June 20th 2012
Published: June 20th 2012


St. Xavier's College
This is the college courtyard/basketball court... Now imagine this place full of people!
Hey all!

It's only been 13 days since I've arrived, and only 9 since I started college here, but I already have a million stories to tell! I'm sure I'll forget half while writing this, but hopefully the ones I remember, and the thoughts I've had so far will do.

As some of you might know, I've left my Nunni Uncle and Lovleen aunty's place, and finally found a place! Jonny and I stayed in hotels for 2 nights while looking, so as to be closer to the school and to make it easier to travel to different apartments. On the first night we stayed at the West End Hotel, (where the toilet somehow got plugged **cough**Jonny**cough**. On top of that, there was a few hours where Jonny went missing and I thought I was going to have to file a police report and completely restart the househunt (the first obviously being more important...*more coughing* did I mention I'm a little sick?) Anyways, to top it all off we left the West End asking the cab to take us to this cheaper hotel that Jonny had booked... turns out it was in Kerela, about a 20 hour drive away. What craziness! Thankfully we found a cheaper but still nice hotel just down the road that had some availabilites, where I made friends with the staff and the toilet remained unplugged, hallelujah.

Anyways, we found a great 2BHK place in Bandra, thanks to Savio, one of the many brokers we met, where Natasha, our landlady, was kind enough to let us move in on Tuesday night so we didn't have to pay for another night in a hotel. She has 3 kids and is such a mom!! It's kind of great though, she showed us where to shop and is always there to answer any questions we might have. Savio introduced us to his hired help, Savita, who is super nice (but doesn't speak English, so there's a lot of sign language involved), and who we made a deal with to come cook dinner and clean for us 6 days a week (for cheap too!) So far she's been great, and has even seemed to make friends with my Nanny over Skype. I'm not sure if I should feel bad about how cheap it is, but I guess that's just the way it is here, and she doesn't seem unhappy so...

Additionally, I got a phone sorted, which is nice, but was also a bit of an experience... The guy at Vodaphone who helped me get set up actually asked what caste I am! I awkwardly responded, ""Uhhh I have no idea..."", do people even use that anymore?! Especially in big cities... I was surprised.

So now that we finally have a base, figuring out school was a little less stressful (but infinitely moreso than the processes for registering for schools in Canada). After a week of going to school I finally have my schedule sorted, but I still haven't been able to get my student ID, train concession, academic calendar, or beginners Hindi course sorted (I inquire about all these things every day, and there's always something in the way, even if it's simply that they're too busy). Anyways classes so far seem good, the professors all seem genuinely interested and involved, which is always motivating and makes the class 100x better than it would be if they were just there for the hell of it (like how some profs in Canada are really only there for their research). The only thing is that I feel like I've stepped back into high school or worse even. At school there's no computers or wifi, you have class at 8-9 in the morning, you're not allowed to chew gum, wear skirts, shorts or dresses above the knee, or sleevless tops. What?! No sleeveless shirts or shorts in 45 degree weather?! I was thinking that maybe it's like how there's yoga, and then there's hot yoga just to challenge you (and see how long it takes for you to pass out)...

Anyways, I've also made some friends in the college and outside too... some Indians, one American, and 4 French guys! So far things are looking pretty good on the social front, I even went to a nightclub this weekend! Some friends of Jonny's from school took us out and it was ""mindblasting"" as Russel Peters/actual Indians might say. It had a great atmosphere, similar to clubs in North America or Europe, with people dressed up and drinking, strobe lights and fog machines (haha, but not in the 'high school dance' sort of way) but with a mix of Indian songs (and people) thrown in! How fun, and there were a ton of white people there too actually. I'm not sure how expensive it would have been if our friend didn't know the manager, so I'm hoping there are some cheaper places (I've heard some really fancy ones charge up to $30 for cover!)

Ok so moving on, some other experiences I'm pretty proud of is taking the rickshaw and train alone to school and back! Ok well maybe I'm taking first class and go in the ladies compartment on the train (s/o to my french homies who take the men's second class), but still! At least I have a place to sit, I feel safer, and it doesn't stink in this compartment, and it's still cheaper than taking public transport in Canada. Actually today someone asked me about a stop on the line, and I could actually answer her question! Go me. On the trains I have seen some eunichs and a lot of little boys sneaking on to the ladies compartment, though no one really seems to care about them unless they're making a ruckus or are past a certain age. As for visiting around, things have been really busy, but we've seen places like Marine Drive and Carter Rd. in Bandra, which are both beautiful and busy places by the water.

Anyways if you've reached this point of the blog, congrats 'cause I've written a lot! I just have so much to share since it's only been 1 week... Until next time!

ready to go
Tuesday 20:39 – Abu Dhabi



Flight was great. No turbulence, good company, good films and good food. Only criticism was the service, it was good, but there wasn’t a constant supply of drinks. You had to ring the annoying buzzer which alerted the whole plane that there was either an annoying f****r on board. Or a pisss head. I stuck with my 2 cups of tea and a stubby Heineken. 8 out of 10.



AD Airport – Free, easy to use/quick wifi. Checked facebook, sent mum and dad an email and skyped Bigs and Alex. Got all the typical western facilities as imagined. Clean/modern/compact and very air conditioned. Only aspect of the airport reminding you that you are not at home is the Islamic (?) prayer music which floats around, giving a cultural but eerie tone to the environment.



Arriving into Mumbai at around 2:45 am (Wednesday 13th) I was instantly hit by the humidity and heat. The density of Mumbais population was also experienced as I qued for passport control. Omkar, the Mumbaiker student studying at Swansea was waiting for me and helped me to get a pre-paid taxi. The cost
90's ready for Mumbai
was R460 (about £8) – for a 45 minute taxi journey in the early hours of the morning I didn’t think was too bad. I prepared myself to walk out in Mumbai alone and was instantly approached by a tout who led me to my taxi helped me with my bag and demanded a tip. He was aggressive in manner and very rude. I refused to give him anything.



The journey was a real eye-opener, poverty filled the streets and so did the stench of the open sewerage. My excitement was now filled with anxiety, worry and a feeling of being lost. For the first time I was regretting coming to India alone. I couldn’t check into my hotel until 10am, the time now was 5am. After a long discussion the manager let me sleep on the couch in the dining area. this beat his idea of having a walk around the station to find some food by a million miles. I was awoken at 6am and given breakfast which consisted of chocolate cornflakes with steamed milk and a chilli, tomato and onion omelet. If I was to be told this will be the only meal I
coffee with lou and the rents at heathrow
would feel safe eating today I would of gone back for seconds…



My room was perfect I couldn’t of asked for a nicer more comfortable room. The only issue was a water leak from the air conditioning unit. It was bearable so I got my head down and slepted until 2pm. I left the hotel and hit streets around 3:30pm – rucksack packed lightly with what I felt was appropriate for the day (laptop, phone, money, passport, notepad, lostplanet guide, waterproof coat, deet) After food, rest and sleep I was prepared and excited to get out onto the streets. A few stares from people walking past (a fixed, wide-eyed glaze with no expression is pretty strange and intimidating), the intense heat and the occasional stench was the only slightly uncomfrotable factors to the streets of Mumbai. Other than that they are exciting and busy areas with a range of uses. transport routes, work place, rest place and for the unfortunate majority a place they would regard to as there home. It was disturbing to see families and small children congregated on the street with little protection from the sewarage which surrounded the place where they ate, slepted,
round 2 (bigs/adam)
worked and played. Despite this many of them were happy, smiling and laughing.



First on the ‘to do’ list was to get my train ticket booked. Victoria terminus (Chhatprati Shivaji Terminus) was hectic. People everywhere. They were busy doing there own thing and pretty used to seeing tourists, the building was great and the gothic architecture is very impressive. The station had a tourist only counter which I was a bit unsure about using at first as I thought the prices might be a lot higher (as is everything for a westerner). 220 rupees (about £3) got a me a sleeper ticket to Ahmedabad which is about 10 hours, very cheap and meant not spending half my day queuing. Walking the streets and formulating my first impressions of the city I came across the ‘the swedes’. The twin brothers from Sweeden. Comparing maps we decided to hit a café recommended in the trusty lost planet guide. ‘Mocha Bar’. It was not quite ‘filled to the brim with bohemian students deep in estoric conversation’ as the guide states which we were happy about it. It was instead slightly over priced, dull and the only customers were wealthy Indian
The big man taking me to Abu Dhabi
students strutting around arrogantly with large bottles of bud and chocolate cake(?). The air conditioning, delicious chai latte and chilled out play list made for a good environment for me to argue why England will beat Sweden in the Euros.



I spent the next two days with the Swedish twins. We ticked off the highlights in Mumbais ‘not to miss’ list. Taj Mahal hotel, where the terror attacks happened a few years back, Indias second largest tourist attraction – the indian gate. Chowpatty beach, watched a Bollywood movie (which we left early because the air-con left us shivering), visited several markets and tested a few local beers in the cities diverse range of bars. After a few kingfishers on the first night we confidently made our way home chatting to locals on our way. A family living on one of the streets invited us to sit and eat with them. If it wasn’t for the alcohol I probably would of refused but with a bit of dutch courage and the swedes company I decided to take them up on their offer. We shared a limited conversation made up of broken English and gestures of hand shakes and
Mumbai Station
laughter. We were given fresh hot bread and dhal. Im not sure whether it was the beer or the fact I hadn’t eaten since 6 or 7 am but the food tasted brilliant.



The market areas have been the most powerful experience so far. At a first glimpse the extremely dense, narrow and bustling streets appear to be chaotic but a deeper look and you see that the market streets are areas of ordered chaos - very complex systems that work. The public street becomes the place for work, rest and play. The work place is the home. There is a great sense of community, the traders are all communicating with each other and offering help where possible. As I was told by a young Indian who showed me to a bar, the streets of Mumbai never sleep. People work 24/7 which means the streets are always active creating a ‘natural surveillance’. This improves the safety of local people and increases the perception of safety for tourists, massively. The very western influenced (seemed to learn his English and dress sense from gangster movies) Indian spoke about how the masses of people constantly congregating the streets create a
Photo 8
type insurgency with regards to criminals (taking the law into their own hands), he said the people rely on this type of security, when I asked why he replied with “cops man…cops f*****g corrupt”. His talk of how he is Indias biggest cocaine dealer, and works closey with Russian mafia was finally dropped after two Kingfishers, when he told us how he actually works for a local replica european coffee shop and due to his good english language is employed to attract tourists.



The markets we visited were Crawford market, Bhuleshwar market and Chor Bazarr (known as thieves market). The fruit and veg part of the food markets were colorful with amazing aromas. The sellers encouraged photographs, they would stand proud with their product and always ask to see the photo once it was taken. They didn’t have an email address so unfortunately I couldn’t send them the pictures. The meat and fish market was like a seen from a horror movie. Puddles of blood on the pavements, masses of big black crows filled the sky and cocky rats would stroll around confidently feasting of the heads of animal corpses. The pungent stench of dead animals and
Photo 9
fish coupled with the rats meant that we didn’t stay in the meat section for to long. Passing through the meat area we ended up at what appeared to be the pet area. Cages of animals lined the now even narrower streets. Rabbits, kittens, birds, pigeons, chickens and even sausage dog puppies were available to buy. £40 for a pup! The animals were distressed in the heat. Water and protection from the sun was not available for them. The heat, the over-powering smells, the constant sound of motor bikes, shouting and horns forced us to leave the market area and find shelter in a cool Muslim restaurant – mutton and rice was not a great choice after the meat market experience. 4 mouthfuls and I was uncomfortably full. The meat is extremely rich and very tough – the meat here is a lot fresher it has not had as much time to hang and remove the blood. At least this is what Ive been told!I’ve been sticking to the vegetarian options which are all really good.

I got
Walk to Chapatty Beach
chatting to a couple of wealthy Mumbai locals at a bar and they took me for food and their favorite food stall. Karen, the guys name brought me dinner. It was a ‘pager wrap’ (not sure of the spelling), basically it is the brain of either a pig or a sheep wrapped with vegetables and yoghurt. The brain was extremely soft and rich, kind of like pate. Karen described brain as ‘the cream cheese of meat’. This didn’t help. I ate as much as I could but could feel my stomach turning so I gave up but gave it a good shot. The free meal and lift home in a leather seated air-con car was a nice finish to a busy day.



The following day I headed north of the city to Kurla, this is where Mumbai university is located, it is also where Dharavi (the huge slum where slumdog millionaire was filmed) and Mumbais emerging financial district is located . I got breakfast from a food stall, the best meal I’ve eaten so far. It was a mixture of potato, chili, onion, coriander all mashed together wrapped in a fresh hot bread and served with a
Photo 11
selection of dips. The portion was huge and only cost R22 (about 30p). The whole street food experience is like a big social gathering. Everyone stands around chatting, its very much like a busy bar. The university campus was really nice. Its peaceful and very calm. Large trees and plants surround the area providing good shade. However, the facilities are very old and of poor condition.



I then went on to visit Dharavi. As I approached a small entrance to the rear I started to get a little anxious and really wanted some company. It was very full on. I approached cautiously and was instantly approached by a hoard of laughing children running bare foot through the sewage and littered streets. A few shady looking teens stood staring with arms folded and no expression. A rickshaw driver approached me and advised me not to enter by pointing to the entrance and shaking his head. I waited a bit longer, thinking should I/ shouldn’t I. I was approached by 2 more drivers and finally a policeman who made my mind up for me “You cannot be here, you go there” pointing towards the new fancy looking financial area

that is beginning to paint Mumbai’s new and powerful skyline. I managed to get a couple of pictures before I left but really wish I could of walked through it.



The very impressive financial area did not feel like Mumbai at all. The streets where quiet and that love/hate relationship built up by all the hustle and bustle had disappeared and been replaced with wide empty roads, fabulous modern skyscrapers and security guards with aggressive Alsatians. The only residents other than the sleeping rick-shaw drivers were very wealthy Indians in modern western attire and the occasional rich, white westerner. This emerging area is being built shoulder to shoulder with Asia’s largest and possibly most poorest slum. It was fascinating how one minute your in one of the worlds poorest areas and within say 20-30 meters you are within the worlds richest. It was a very explicit example of Indias inequalities, and a case of where a country whos economy is booming has failed to integrate and absorb the urban poor.



Luckily my taxi driver back to the south of the city drove me through the heart of Dharavi slum. I was very grateful for
Photo 13
the police officer’s advice. It would not of been safe for me to walk through the slum. I massively underestimated the size and state of Dharavi. Sitting in a taxi with the windows up when we stopped and I still felt a little unsafe. The streets are swarming with people and are much narrower than the rest of the city and far worse than what I have seen on the internet or in books, I think this is because I couldn’t comprehend the sheer size of the slum from a textbook. It just seemed to go on and on, and even upwards. Make-shift, tin roofed shacks piled on top of each other made out of any resources that can be obtained and surrounded by mounds of rubbish. I wouldn’t of felt safe walking through the slum alone but would love to go back with an actual tour guide and experience it not just from through the tinted window of the taxi.

I was exhausted from all the walking and got my taxi to drop me off at a bar that would be showing some football. I sat, drank beer, people watched and then bumped into 4 French lads on
Burn up?
an internship looking for the football. I went with them to watch the game, England was on too late so none of the bars showed the whole thing. Back to the hotel and I listened to it alone on the radio.

Mumbai is a very intense city. My experience of it has been fun, exciting and scary at times. The memories that will stick with me the most are the constant sound of car horns, the strong smells (sometimes of the great street food and others of open sewerage), hectic streets, the intense heat, the old black and yellow taxis, and as an example of where the extremely wealthy and the extremely poor live amongst each other. Although there is tons of work needed to be done in terms of development for Mumbai, it is a city that works, in a strange kind of way. Next up is the 10hour train journey to Ahmedabad. Oh how I wish I dug a little deeper into my pockets and brought a 1st class ticket…

Waiting Patiently
I’d been in Bombay for over week by the time I realized that I hadn’t actually been to Bombay. The true city – as well as its major tourist destinations – lies at the southern end of the seven islands. I hadn’t left the northern suburbs since my arrival and, for some reason, I didn’t feel the need to. I preferred to stay at home and teach my CS host how to bake a cheesecake than line up with all the sightseers, hawkers and beggars on Colaba Causeway. If I hadn’t received an invitation to dine at the infamous Leopold Café (the hang-out spot of the author of Shantaram), I might never have made it there on my own.

The fastest way to get downtown was a trip on the local train. I hadn’t yet utilized that mode of transportation and I wasn’t quite sure how the system worked. But it’s never too hard to find help, especially from members of the opposite sex (once they recover from the shock of a foreign lady speaking to them). Two guys helped me buy a ticket and directed me to Platform 4/5, before running to catch their own train. My train was
Western Railway
leaving from Platform 5, but I still hadn’t fully processed that information when I saw a train departing from Platform 4. I leaped onto it, not wanting to be left behind, and it quickly picked up speed. It was at that point that I saw the train heading towards Churchgate pulling into the platform opposite me. I was on the wrong train. I looked down. We were moving fast, but not that fast. Without a moment’s hesitation to actually think about what I was thinking about doing, I leaped off.

My body continued to move with the speed of the train, while my feet hit the unmoving ground with a jarring impact that sent me rolling across the filthy station floor. I rolled right back up onto my feet and caught the admonishment of an aunty yelling “Never jump!” as I ran across the platform to take another leap of faith onto the right train. I wish I could say that I jumped into the train, but there was barely enough room for my toes, let alone the rest of my body, in the overcrowded carriage. We instantly sped away from the site of the scene. My shirt was
Ladies Carriage
torn, my trousers dirty and my elbow bloody, but my pride was surprisingly uninjured. It all seemed like a dream. Had I really just jumped from a moving train? Who does that?

The Bombay that greeted me at the Churchgate station was a complete surprise. It dawned on me that I’d never even seen a picture of the city and had no idea what to expect. It was old England plopped down in the middle of the tropics and tons of people. Large stone buildings with monkey-shaped gargoyles presided over streets where horse-drawn carriages lined with neon lights rolled alongside hundreds of black and yellow cabs. It was a completely different Bombay than the one I knew. In this Bombay, I lost my anonymity. I was spotted as a foreigner from a distance and instantly surrounded by peddlers selling city tours, maps, and man-sized balloons. Children not too far away from being babies themselves toted wobbly-necked newborns on their hips, pulling the heartstrings of passersby as they begged for a few rupees or scraps of food. And everyone wanted a click with the white-skinned alien. They shoved toddlers into my arms and turned me this way and that until
Don't Be Late!
I’d achieved the ideal pose for the family photo. The location might have been new, but I’d been there before and, suddenly, I wasn’t sure that I hadn’t preferred the hectic journey to its destination.

In my opinion, riding the local trains in Bombay is a “Must-Do” for any foreign visitor, preferably at rush hour for maximum effect. The railway cars are so tightly packed that you can feel whether or not the woman behind you is wearing a bra; you can taste the vadapav the woman next to you ate for lunch, and see the sweat trickling down the neck of the woman in front of you. In any other country, I might find the separate cars for men and women sexist, but I’m thankful that India practices the segregation of sexes – I don’t know if I could handle being so intimately crushed between so many men.

Many mishaps lie in wait for the inexperienced passenger of the overflowing railway system, but the learning curve is quick. It has to be, or you run the risk of being carried out in the press of people at the wrong station, or being unable to reach the exit
Leopold Cafe
at the right station. Familiarizing yourself with the order of the stations, which side the platform is on at each one, and the destinations of the people around you are all musts if you want to ensure your ability to alight at the appropriate time. As your stop approaches, it’s essential to be standing within the group getting off at the same station, preferably nearest the door, so that you can hop off before the train has come to a complete stop. In this manner, you’ll avoid being pushed back into the train with the oncoming crowd.

It’s only at these moments of getting on and off the train that I’ve seen Indians lose their composure and become absolute crazy people. They shove, elbow, slap and half-strangle people by their scarves to secure their place. Then, once inside and packed tighter than sardines, they regain their humanity. If they see someone coming late, running to catch the train, they’ll reach out to pull him in, and squeeze a little closer together to make room. In Bombay, adjustments are always willing to be made, in trains as in life.

High Noon Sky
I arrived in Bombay a week before the monsoon was due. For those of you who have ever visited or lived in a tropical climate, I don’t have to tell you that it’s the worst time of year to turn up. It’s hot and humid, thick and sticky. It gives you the impression that you’ve turned into a steamed vegetable. Just sitting and staring at the fan is enough make you sweat; ingesting gallons of water becomes a daily requirement to replace the fluid lost in perspiration from your upper lip alone. Every day, you search the sky for a sign that the rains will come and cool you down. But, this year, the search was in vain. The monsoon was late in Bombay.

To escape the heat one day, a few friends and I went to a swanky hotel to use their pool. After paying a whopping 500 rupees (US$10), we were granted access to a beautifully shimmering, wonderfully inviting pool and a patio that overlooked Juhu Beach. It looked lovely, despite its lack of shade-making umbrellas for the tables and comfort-conferring cushions for the wicker lounge chairs. We sat down at a table on the beach’s edge and
Rain is Coming!
politely asked the attendant for an umbrella. He threw his hands up at the sunny sky, “No umbrellas. We’re closed for the rain.” Oh I see, the rain. Of course.

Unable to handle the sun beaming down on our bare heads, we abandoned the good view of our table and took refuge in the shade of the building. We were hungry. The umbrella-denying server came to take our order. We all wanted sandwiches. He took mental note of our request and walked away. A minute later, he returned to our table to ask, “Do you want your sandwiches grilled or toasted?” We all opted for grilled. “Grilling not possible,” he said, “Only toast.” Okay. Toasted it is. Thanks for asking.

When the overly toasted sandwiches showed up, we hungrily scarfed them down. Then, against the advice of every mother in the world, we jumped into the pool with full bellies and spent the afternoon not caring about the lack of shade, the confusion of the staff or the impossibility of grilling a sandwich. We just enjoyed the cool water.

As if by some magic in the flick of the waiter’s hands earlier, the first shower of the
Monsoon Green
monsoon arrived that night. The sky suddenly tore open, unleashing the rain it had been so greedily hoarding in a torrential downpour. While the raindrops fell fat on the ground, the heady scent of wet earth rose to fill my nostrils, which began to sting with the sharp bite of ammonia soon thereafter. You see, in India, kissing in public is frowned upon, but pissing in public is quite commonplace (with more than half the population lacking basic facilities, it’s really the only option). So, carried in on the cold breeze was the reek of millions of liters of piss. At that point, though, I didn’t care. The monsoon had finally come. I threw my hands out to my sides, turned my face up to the rain and let it soak me from head to toe.

Today I was going to go to Agakahn Palace where the British held Gandhi for awhile. Instead I went shopping, which I think is an equally good cultural experience! My first destination was the Koregaon Park Plaza to buy a backpack to carry my laptop in more easily. Turns out this is a VERY swanky mall and hardly anyone was in it. Tommy Hilfiger, Next, Swarovski, Accessorize, Levis and various other Western brands were selling at Western prices. Went to the Spar Hypermarket (yes, there are BIG versions here) and picked up a bag for 500 INR (the exhange rate is rougly £1:85 INR), some lychees, a mango and a papaya for another 200 (which is pretty pricey). Had a coffee then headed out to MG Road with a friend. Much more ""normal"" area where locals shop. Picked up a load of kurtas and leggings/harem pants and then met up with one of Meera's friends, who has already invited me to her Mum's for food when I'm next over. Grabbed a Lime Soda (sweet not salted) then came back on my own to the flat to make a fruit salad and have a shower. I'm now sat in the living room with both the balcony doors open and it is NOISY. initially I thought it must be someone in the same building watching TV, but no! There is some sort of motocross thing going on in a stadium about half a mile away and they are using the biggest loudspeaker. In the run up they were playing a load of club music and now he is talking about driver number 24.... Gargh!! Having some dinner soon and then probably heading out between 9 and 10 to see some football at a pub or bar.

Monday

On Monday I went to my first slum community. I have no sense of direction in this city beyond my mental image of google maps so I have no idea where it was. I am still really hung up on sticking out like a sore white chick thumb and added to advice not to stare I can't report too much on what the place looked like. We entered by scooter off one of the main roads and straight away you are on dusty lanes about 3-5 metres wide. These are full of women preparing stuff outside their shacks, kids in various states of dress, other vehicles and your standard helping of scruffy dogs.

I met a group of teenage boys who are attending a class once a week on gender equality. It was only then that I began to understand the challenges of working in these communities. At around 16 and 17 the boys are expected to get involved in political groups. Sometimes they just have to lie to the leaders about where they are going and there was a tense moment when a man came in to find one of the boys. At some stage in the programme an individual might decide that they want to confront their father about beating up their mother or sister and this is also a tricky, and possibly dangerous, process. Often the women won't support their sons in doing this because they think it will only make the situation worse. Drugs, porn and alcohol are readily availble in some areas and the boys can be under a lot of pressure from peers to get involved in activities that increase the likelihood of them treating women like crap. And there are countless other problems beyond these.

Tuesday

I have been torn between my desire to say hi to the really cute puppies that are camped out near to the apartment and my fear that they are actually rabies-carrying pests out to kill me. Really don't want to end up like the British woman who recently died after being nipped in India. So I shall resist the urge and also save myself from getting fleas.

Mumbai
View from an apartment in Goregaon East, Mumbai.
Hey everyone! So the first 24 hours of Mumbai has been a success!! There have been some minor blips such as swollen feet and frizzy hair from the heat and humidity, but all in all it's really starting to feel like the start of an adventure! First of all I have to mention that the week before leaving home in Canada was great, I got to see so many people and spend some time with my family. But it was also filled with so much anxiety! I felt nervous, excited, and stressed all at once. Seems like mostly all the preparations went smoothly though, and it was really nice to leave on a high note (though I'll probably miss it more now!).

Then there was the actual travel, with Jet Airways. It seems to be quite a nice company, with lots of food and drinks (free alcohol too, which surprised me, and also contributed to my lack of sleep, as the guy behind me got a bit drunk and rowdy on the first flight, lol…) So that was around a 7 hour flight to Bruxelles, followed by a 2 hour layover, then another 9 hour flight to Mumbai (that had crying babies, a diamond man beside me, and a cute flight attendant which was just a bonus hehe). The whole time I was feeling sick with anticipation and nerves, which sort of surprised me because I've never felt sick from nerves, especially for travel. However, whether because of fatigue or a number of 'I'm a badass' songs, by the time I got there I was fine. I stepped off the plane to a huge wave of humidity and a strong smell of the memory of my grandparents luggage from every time they came back from India.

After a little confusion getting my luggage (there was sign saying baggage from Newark, another connecting flights to Brussels), I stepped outside to a huge mass of waiting people, so I took a walk around and finally found my uncle Nunni waiting, who had a sign with my name on it, as we've never actually met before. His mother (R.I.P.) and my grandfather were first cousins. Shortly after we were joined by Khanna uncle, who is my grandfather's friend from a long time ago, who really just came to make sure I made it alright, which was really nice of him.

So now I'm currently staying with Nunni uncle, his wife, little boy, and father, who are all nice. They have two apartments in a building in Goregaon East, one for living and one for working, so I'm staying alone in their office apartment. It's nice to be able to step away and have my own space for a bit, especially since jet lag has had me waking up and sleeping at wonky hours (I woke up at 4:30am today and started writing this lol). The internet connection isn't great, and they don't have A/C, but I'm really grateful that they're helping me out for the first few days. It'll be nice to have my own place though.

Yesterday Nunni uncle took me down to South Mumbai, because both Vaishali from the OMG Program, and the lady on the phone at the Foreign Registration office said I had to come in and register within 24 hours of arriving. So we drove an hour and a half down there to find out that I actually don't have to register! So that was fucking irritating, especially since my uncle took me all the way down there. So to everyone with a 6 month Indian student visa: YOU DON'T HAVE TO REGISTER AT THE FRO! Just register with the local police station so you can get a rental, phone, internet contract etc. Anyways, it wasn't so bad, because the office is right next to my school, so I got to see it! It was full of people when we went because there was admissions going on, so I couldn't even go in, but it was nice to see anyways. Then we went for a yummy lunch at this art gallery that I'll have to check out sometime. I tried going to the washroom in there though, and it was a squatter!!! Hahahah I don't know what they're actually called, but I saw them in the airport too… They're not real toilets, just sort of holes in the floor that you squat over and… well, go. Weird, I guess I'll have to try sometime hehe. Then on the way home we drove by the Gate of India and the Taj Hotel, which got me really pumped to see landmarks that I recognized! I'M REALLY HERE!!!! You know, it already feels like I've been here forever, almost like slipping into an old sweater, as some might say… hopefully this feelings lasts.

I noticed that there's quite a difference from South Mumbai to the North, well from what I've seen here in Goregaon East anyways. South Mumbai seems really clean and modern, while up here I've already seen a ton of street kids, stray dogs, and garbage heaps. I'm not judging of course, just noticing. I guess that class differences are reflected in space too here in India. On they way back I was half asleep, but it started POURING. The monsoon is almost here, so I have to mentally and physically prepare myself for that, but I don't really know what to expect so it might take some adjusting to. The rain that started could be described as 'raining buckets,' the drops were huge and the people walking around were soaked, but seemed happy about it (maybe people wouldn't be so happy to be soaked in South Mumbai? I don't know). We pulled up to the building where Nunni uncle lives, and there was a group of young boys, including his son Avi, laughing and playing in the rain and kicking up the puddles of water that had already formed, it was like a scene out of a Bollywood movie! My aunt Lovleen says that 80% of Mumbai's economy relies on the monsoons, so therefore I have come to the conclusion that the monsoon is like making love: a hot, fun buildup, followed by a huge release, resulting in fertilization. Hahaha sorry for the crude humour.



Anywayysss now the goal is to find somewhere to live! WISH ME LUCK!

Back on the phone, the internet cafe was just to hot. We are now 5 days into our stay in kolkata and it has definitely been an experience to say the least. Before I go into our kolkata journey I will briefly tell about our day in mumbai- aka bollywood. After packing 8 people and 8 rather large suitcases into 2 very small cars for the 3.5 hour trip from pune to kolkata we arrived in mumbai. We had two taxis for the day and saw mumbai, a city of 15 million people, in 7 hours. I wish we had more time in mumbai from what we were able to see of it, it was a really awesome city. We visited the gateway of india, the taj mahal palace hotel (sight of the 2008 terrorist attack), and the queens necklace- a very peaceful look from the coast of the skyline of mumbai. The next morning we would be on our way to kolkata to experience a heat and humidity that no one could have prepared for.

So its 03:22 here, making it around 11pm back home. I woke up at 7am on the 1st, which means I am just about to sleep without doing a nodding dog impression for the first time in 40 hours. How I managed to go out clubbing from 9pm I don't know. Have just got back after 6 1/2 hours out with a bunch of people and had a great time. Went to one bar, sat outside and spent about £10 on a cocktail and a load of food. The drinks were really cheap there - around £2.50 for my cocktail, but they do charge you £5 cover to get in. Food was delicious - quite spicy but haven't had any ""problems"" yet. It's a warm night but with a little bit of a breeze. We then went to Oakwood - a laid back lounge bar with cocktails for around £4.50.



Intending to sleep for a good 7 hours, have breakfast and probably go to a pool party at O Hotel tomorrow in the day. Must also find time to skype the boyfriend.





Hopefully posts from now on will be more coherent!

Disclaimer: I haven't slept for more than 2 broken up hours in the last 30 so the below is unlikely to make sense.

Today I broke several rules that are intended to make sure you don't get diarrohea.

1. Do not eat salad unless you know its been washed in clean water

2. Do not have any drink with ice cubes in it

Whilst zonked out in a cab after a 9 hour flight and 2 hours of driving (I use the term loosely), my driver pulled into a drive-through Maccy D's and offered to buy me some food. I tried to politely refuse. The poor guy was clearly concerned that I hadn't eaten anything yet, I held fast on the food but eventually gave in to a coke. I just didn't have the energy to try to explain again that I didn't want any food to the McDonald's worker, and not wanting to make my driver look like a lousy person, ended up agreeing to the full works: chips, chicken burger and a coke. Food arrives and it dawns on me that my nemesis, dirty water, has already worked its way into my diet in at least two forms.



Predicament: Do I risk getting ill in the middle of a car journey when my immune system probably isn't at its best, given the lack of sleep, heat etc, so that I don't seem impolite by not eating my food? Is the risk from not eating/drinking of seeming impolite greater than the risk of spilling my guts in this guys car if I do said/eating drinking?



Lettuce disposable was quick and easy, leaving only a couple of mayo-covered scraps and a wipe with the paper wrapping. But then I was left with a large cup of potential misery and humiliation. Hoping that I could just get away with not drinking it, the kid in the front seat keeps looking at me and is clearly asking his dad why the weird foreign chick asks for a coke then doesn't drink it.

So, one option is to somehow sip from the coke and spit it back into a spare bottle I have. I try this several times when we go through a tunnel but just can't get through it quick enough. (Should remember I have manky coke in my bottle before I use it next). When this clearly isn't working I decide to have a gulp and if I don't feel really dodgy in about 20 minutes, I should probably be ok. After getting through half the cup I was still fine, but growing more concerned that maybe the gestation period of some gut rotting lurgy would be more than 20 minutes.

Thankfully, the day was saved by a penguin shaped bin at a petrol station.

Sunset from the light house of Harne port
We drove off to the KARDE BEACH near Dapoli last weekend....

just wanted to break off from office routines and meetings ! 😞

heres some info....

Karde beach is a non-descript beach to the north of Dapoli. If you are looking for a nice, clean beach without the maddening crowds, then this is a good option. The waters are calm, the sand clean and the beach is quite long too. You can do parasailing/ATV in the evenings and boat rides for dolphin watching are available in the mornings.

If you go a little to the north, you will reach the fishing village of Harnai. This place is famous for the fish auction which happens twice a day. Also, there are three forts/structures next to each other worth a visit along with the suvarnadurga island fort.

Driving further north will take you to Anjarle. The Anjarle Ganesh temple is noteworthy for the Ganesha idol with the trunk turned the other way. There is a long bridge connecting Harnai and Anjarle which makes for a good viewpoint. To avoid going through the extremely narrow streets of Anjarle, you can take the bypass (MSH4 – scroll a bit in
Karde Beach
the map below). The views of the coast are amazing from this road.

The most amazing thing about Karde is you can see dolphins in morning time (more frequently from Nov till Feb), yes you heard it rite DOLPHINS if you take a small boat ride costing around 100 bucks per head. Its an awesome place to be at nite since the sound of waves and trawler boats can be heard. We stayed in a small Wadi (the small houses which people give on rent ) and was great eperience.You can also visit Janjeera fort (Fort captured by Shivali maharaj. It's a fort in water and can to be reached by boat. If you are planning to see Dolphins and fort the boat guy will charge around 350/- Rs per head).

To add a little more value to the trip , you may drive further towards the 8th century ANCIENT CAVES !

Panhalekaji, the famous rock-cut caves are situated on the bank of the river Kotjai which further meets the Dabhol creek. These historical manmade caves are believed to be more than 1000 years old and are the great examples of ancient cultural and architecture. There
By sunset on the clean sands...
are a total 29 rock cut-caves, both big and small spread along the river bank. You can find Buddhist as well as Hindu religious rock hewn sculptures similar to Anjantha caves. There are sculptures of Ganesh, Saraswati and scenes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana on the walls.

The carvings in these rock-cut caves create a unique blend of history of that period and natural beauty. It may take couple of hours to see all these caves in detail. One can also relax in the shadow of Mango trees, enjoy a refreshing swim in the river or simply stop and admire the outstanding scenery that this area has to offer. You can also take a walk along the river bank to enjoy the flora and fauna on both sides. Jungle covered mountains lie on both sides of the river. There is also a fort called ""Pranaldurg"" at top of the mountain. Every visitor feels in harmony with the nature, which breathtakingly unfolds around the river. In this remote area you can see variety of birds flying around and you may also get chance to spot Asian river otters.

Visitors get transported to a different world when exploring the
No one on the beach for miles :)
ancient architecture in these caves. You can enjoy the tranquility and peacefulness of the jungle and walk in the woodlands. Bird enthusiasts will not be disappointed as this is an excellent area for bird watching. You can also spend your time fishing. Be sure to make a trip to Panhalekaji a part of your beach holiday vacation.

Panhalekaji is situated around 20 km from Dapoli. State Transport (ST) buses run between Dapoli and Panhalekaji. You can also hire an auto rickshaw or drive down. Rented jeeps / cars are available.

............................

We stayed at Sagar Raj Beach Resort ! extremely clean and well maintained ....and its literally ON the beach...



Enjoy endless walks on the sand....serene nature...the silence and sound of waves !

Njoy the pics 😊

Sorry it has taken so long to make our first in country entry, we have limited internet and I'm typing this on a phone- which isn't quick or fun at all. We had a rough start to say the least, coming out of chicago we were delayed an hour and a half which made us miss our connecting flight in london...we then had to spend 13 hours in the london airport which is something I wouldn't even wish on my worst enemies...london airport sucks. After hours of sleeping on benches and being looked at funny we finally headed to delhi- we actually needed to be in mumbai. Landing in delhi we knew the true test would be if our bags somehow made it there too. Justin found his bag right away so we had hope, that hope was short lived. The rest of our bags were nowhere to be found. The delhi bag lady, who is a saint, told us they might be in mumbai waiting for us. So we hopped on another plane and arrived in mumbai at 6pm on monday the 22nd. Unfortunately our bags were not there either and after talking to a baggage rep no one knew where our bags were or when we would get them. We now needed to make the 4 hour car ride to Pune-being in a car driving through mumbai during rush hour is one of the craziest things one can experience- we will just leave it at that. So finally after 50+ hours of traveling, wearing the same clothes, and not sleeping on a bed we arrived at the Royal Connaught Boat Club in Pune...to be continued...

Tag 1:

So ich bin angekommen. Um 3 Uhr nachts. Es ist schwuel, und ich bin ziehmlich platt.

Erst mal ein Prepaidtaxi genommen, damit er sich auch nicht absichtlich verfaehrt. Okay er verfaehrt sich trotzdem. Ich bin natuerlich sehr dankbar dass er mich Nachst in Mumbai nicht an der Strasse rauswirft und geb ihm nach Aufforderung ein ganz gutes Drinkgeld egal. Spaeter hab ich den Eindruck, dass sich alle Taxifahrer nachts absichtlich verfahren um Trinkgeld abzustauben.

Da ich das Zimmer erst ab 11 Uhr bekomme schlafe ich noch etwa 5h im unbequemen Plastikstuhl. Dazu gibt es einen netten Hindujingle vom Miniprivattempel der sich etwa alle 20 Sekunden. Verblueffenderweise kann auch das mich nicht mehr stoeren.

Ich schlaf noch bin 1 Uhr im Bett und denk mir dann: Losgehts. Praktischerweise kommt gerade mein Zimmernachbahr Reece (Holland) ins Zimmer und ich schliess mich gleich zur Slumtour im Dharavislum an. Dort leben auf 1,7km2 etwa eine Million Menschen (zumindest laut Wikipedia, immer brav Quellen nennen 😊). Ist aber aktuell wohl nur das 5 groesste Slum Mumbais. Mein Eindruck vom Slum ist gemischt. Die Arbeitsbedingungen sind teilweise schon echt uebel. Zum Beispiel wenn sie Farbe aus alten Farbkanistern rausbrennen. Es wird viel recycelt, aber auch getoepfert, gebacken usw. Die Wohnbedingungen empfinde ich, auch wenn es arrogant klingt groesstenteils gar nicht so schlimm. Klar haben sie wenig Platz und der Muell ueberall ist auch nicht toll, (da sind sie selbst Schuld) aber in den meisten Faellen Strom und auch problemlos Zugang zu Trinkwasser. Im Slum gibt es auch Schulen und ueberall wird Cricket gespielt. Die Kinder freuen sich immer noch Weisse zu sehen obwohl ja jeden Tag viele durchkommen. Zum Thema ob Slumtourismus in Ordung ist: keine Ahnung. Ich bin froh dass ichs mir angeschaut habe und ein Grossteil der Einnahmen davon geht wohl auch in die Slums.

In der Slumtour lern ich noch verschiedene Leute kennen und gemuetliches Essen mit ner Internationalen Truppe folgt. Fuer mich ist das extrem wertvoll. Da ich mich ja im Vorfeld null ueber nichts informiert habe lass ich mir nuetzliche Reisetipps speziell fuer Zuege geben. Danke Martina und Stefan (Schweiz).



Tag 2: (Scheiss Stromausfaelle jetzt kann ich den gleichen Senf nochmal schreiben)

Ich zieh alleine los. Bisschen Sightseeing usw. Ich seh mir ne Verhandlung im Mumbai Highcourt an. Ist ganz interessant wie sie in ihren Roben herumlaufen aber man versteht nicht wirklich was. Da ich Vollhost meine Jonglierkeulen dabei hab (nehmen sauviel Platz weg ) pack ich sie doch glatt mal aus und stell mich ans Gate of India. Als Weisser ist man ja so schon eine Attraktion aber jonglierend wird man schnell umringt von indischen Handykameras. Werde dauraufhin auch gleich zum Chai eingeladen (Tee ist in Indien grundsaetzlich viel zu suess). Eine Inderin die wundersamerweise gut Englisch spricht, fragt mich ob ich damit versuchen will Geld zu verdienen weil sie nich glaube, dass es funktionieren wird.

Danach laufe ich sauber in einen Scam rein (Verarschung, Betrugsversuch fuer Touristen.) 2 Junge Maenner, (natuerlich auch Studenten die gern Englisch ueben und Deutsch lernen wollen, und mir netterweise den Tipp geben, dasss 2 Minuten Laufweg ein staatliche Touristenbuero ist dass einem ganz umsonst Tipps gibt.) Ja gut naiverweise denk ich mir: man kanns ja mal versuchen. Nach einer kurzen Information soll ich dann gleich eine 14 taegige Rundreise durch Nordindien mit anschliessendem Flug fuer 700 Euro buchen. Ah na klar. Nach einer Diskussion, dass ich es sicher nicht schaffen werde in Indien Zuege zu buchen weil die ueber die Ferien alle voll sind, und ich dann sage, dass ich sicher keine Reservierung bei ihm machen werde schmeisst er mich raus. Klar hab ich kein Geld verloren aber es ist frustrierend weil man ja Vertrauen braucht um im Land etwas zu erleben. Naja.

Ich bin daruafhin etwas frustriert und von den vielen Eindruecken etwas ueberwaeltigt. Gottseidank treff ich zufaelligerweise nochmal Martina und Stefan und mich aufbauen 😊.

3. Tag

Gleich Morgens zum Bahnhof. In Indien werden einen Tag bevor Zuege fahren nochmal einige wenige Tickets rausgegeben. (nennt sich Tatkal). Enstprechend gross ist das Gedraenge morgens um 8 Uhr.Ich will ein Ticket fuer in 2 Tagen, von daher ist es eigentlich Dumm mich ins Getuemmel zu stuerzen aber soviel weiss ich da noch nicht. Egal. Ich stell mich irgendwie in der falschen inoffieziellen Schlange an. Als Bewegung reinkommt draengel ich mich mit anderen vor. Komischerweise schaut mich keiner Boese an. Enweder weil es normal ist oder weil jeder zuviel Angst hat seinen Platz in der schlange zu verlieren. Wegen dem Gedraenge fangen Polizisten an Leute die zu dreist sind zu schlagen und rauszuziehen. Das ist fuer die Leute eine Tragoedie, nicht wegen den Schlaegen sondern weil ihnen die Chace auf ein Ticket genommen wird. Drinnen kann ich als Toursit an den Toursistenschalter. Wie gesagt das Draengeln war komplett umsonst. Ueber die Toursitenquote in den Zuegen krieg ich problemlos mein Ticket nach Goa. Ich bin froh. Kosten fuer 12h Nachtzug nach Goa ohne A.C.: sagenhafte 4 Euro grob.

Zurueck im Hostel schliess ich mich 2 Deutchen beim Sightseeing an. Sarah echt nett und Jaem irgendwie arrogant. Beides Juristenschnoesel 😊. Elephanta Island (nette Bootsfahrt) -> Waschslum -> Worldtrade Center. Passt schon mit den Beiden. Bemerkenswert ist aber ihr extrem unfreundlicher Umgang mit Indern, speziell Taxifahrern. Klar sind die Beiden schon laenger unterwegs, aber die sind schon dreist unfreundlich und wittern ueberall nur Verarschung. Klar werden sie so auch weniger verarscht aber durch das fehlende Vertrauen verpassen sie auch einiges denk ich, abgesehen davon, dass ich so nicht mit Leuten umgehen wuerde. Am Ende schenken sie mir nich ihre indische Simcard. Danke.

Noch mit Johann, Australier der ueberall alles mit dem Fahrad erkundet, und Grant was trinken gegangen. Grant ist den Indern gegenueber sehr offensiv und verarscht sie auf wie Kinder auf eine hoefliche Weise. Seltsam aber leicht angetrunken echt lustig.

4. Tag 22.4

Ein Prakash schwaetzt mich an. Natuerlich will er nur sein Englisch ueben 😉. Ich mach im gleich klar, dass ich nichts kaufen werde usw. und dass ich schelchte Erfahrungen habe. Er total ueberrascht 😉. Wie sowas gibt es, das muss ich meinen Freunden erzaehlen. Widerwillig lass ich mich begleiten und fasse dann doch Vertrauen. Er begeleitet mich ins Ghandihouse, zeigt mir weitere Sehenswuerdigkeiten. Wir unterhalten uns gut und verbringen den ganzen Tag zusammen. Am Ende will er, dass ich ihm ein schickes Hemd kaufe, fuer seinen ersten Arbeitstag Morgen fuer etwa 5 Euro... Ne oder. Da ich ihm irgendwie glaube und in beiden Varianten ein schlechtes Gewissen habe, geb ich ihm die Kohle. Spaeter erfahr ich, dass der Carsten wohl exakt den selben Typen mit der selben Masche getroffen hat, nur dass er ihn nicht solang begelitet hat und nicht reingefallen ist.

Ich geh noch mit lustigem schwulen Brasilianer Carlos was Essen. Wir kommen zum Ende einer riesigen Versammlung von Moslems vorbei. Sehr seltsam Nachst von Horden von Weiss gekleideten Muslems umringt zu sein. Alles friedlich kein Thema. Es ist anscheinend so, dass die Spannungen zwischen Moslems und Hindus mehr oder weniger dadurch ausgetragen werden, dass man sich gegenseitig mit Versammlungen und Festen versucht zu uebertreffen und dadurch Staerke zeigt.

5. Tag 23.4

Nochmal mit Carlos rumgehangen und Zugticket nach Kerala gekauft.

Im Park hab ich ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" getroffen, ein Guide dessen Masche es ist, maximal zu uebertreiben, komplett einzulullen und einem die beste Erfahrung von ganz Mumbai versprochen. Gottseidank geh ich nicht drauf ein, und treffe spaeter im selben Park Ajeet. Auf Anhieb stimmt die Chemie, Er ist so um die 45 schaetze ich, und hat ein sehr beeindruckendes Leben hinter sich. Ich unterhalte mich ewig mit ihm und lade ihn auch zum Essen ein, weil er gerade arbeitslos ist kann er mich nicht einladen. Ich erfahre sehr viel ueber Indien ,ihn selbst und habe wirklich einen echten Freund gefunden. Hurra nach den schlechten Erfahrungen. Auch jetzt einen Monat spaeter mein bisheriges Highlight.

Am selben Abend noch ab nach Goa.

Windmills in Chikhaldhara
It’s about the trip to this quaint small town in Middle of hills. A Difficult one to find in today’s alloy world. Serene, tranquil & untouched by impurity; known as Chikhaldara.

A small town located in Amaravati district of Vidarbha region in the state of Maharashtra, India. It is the only hill station in Vidarbha region that offers bounty of wildlife, view points, waterfalls & many other things to be explored. One can find information surfing through different websites about the population, electricity, township etc of Chikaldhara. But, the information which one can get from this article is that how can one’s experience be in Chilkadhara.

If you want to run away from Hustle – Bustle, looking for a peaceful place which has a typical hamlet kind of ambience then Chikhaldara is the right place to land up. The most earnest thing here is the hush - hush silence, clean air with the redolence of flora around & the unburdening atmosphere. The Best part about this place is that, it is completely away from the kind of populace, which is found in famous hill stations of the country. As this place is so and so, it is a little
View of Mountain strings
away from today’s urbanization. It is also a budget back packing destination for the people residing in the near by cities. All these things could be known only, when one arrives in to Chikhaldara.

It was a short trip, just for one night but gave hundreds of memories to treasure. As we drove towards the hill station, the crisp climate could be felt with tender touch of the breeze. All over was the abode surrounded by wide open fields’, with small cattle grazing around & Wind mills making a typical tenor. Near the fields were small mud layouts, decorated with colorful flowers and wood fencing adding one more beauty spot to the native. As we entered, the only alley in this charming small town welcomed us.

The small town acquires a few places to sojourn the night. The lodging has basic amenities, but gives a homely feel. The places of interest are easily accessible by vehicles. The view points like Devi Point, Gavilgad, Hurricane Point gives a scenic view of the mountain strings. Tourist can also visit Melghat Tiger Project, Dhakana – Kolkaz National Park around Chikhaldara for a wildlife experience. The Melghat Tiger project has mainly tigers
main street
and also houses other animals like panthers, sloth bear, deer’s etc. Narnala fort is another place for those, who would love to see a fort in a hill station, which is quiet unusual.

If all these places do not interest one, they can hire a bi cycle and go around the small town, just as I did. We reached Chikhaldara in the noon; the first task was to find a good place to stay and enjoy our holiday .The search came to an end when we found a hotel. The hotel had basic amenities yet gave a “homely feeling”. The owner of the hotel also resided in the hotel itself, the staff was courteous & well behaved. It had a garden restaurant where we had our lunch which was quiet delicious, the hotel also had a play area for children, sitting area and two playful & skilled dogs which were extremely friendly and felt like bringing them home. In the evening the hotel owner provided a tandem loaded bicycle & we were all set for our “ride down”. The climate was a little biting which turned to chilling post dusk as it was the month of November. It was an experience of existence to have a hot bowl of soup, in the super chilly clime with a candle lit on our table, as there was power cut, but had no problems with that, as all other good things were more than enough to fold over the Power cut Episode.

It was no moon night, making it pitch dark everywhere. The day had come to an end with this and was the time to go to bed. The next morning was check out time & we were all set to bid farewell to the beautiful small town. As we landed on the plains and looked at the mountain strings; the only thought which came into mind was “wish we could have stayed here for some more time”. But nevertheless we had to come back home & on the way, gifted ourselves with dozens of oranges, as it is one of the areas for supply of oranges in the state of Maharastra. With this, the lasting trip came to end, giving us a jillion memories.



Some more Information:

Reaching There –

One can hire a local paid taxi from Amravati. Buses also run from Amravati & different points. Nearest railway station is Badnera around 110Kms. Nearest Airport is Nagpur at a distance of 231Kms.

Accommodation –

There are few hotels & resorts to stay & the facilities are very basic. As this is not so popular it is good to first arrive and book the hotel instead of pre booking it.


Food –

Chikhaldara does not have any typical kind of restaurants. But the hotels for overnight stay have their on restaurant which serves Indian food.



When to Go-

June – September: If one wants to enjoy the rains and wander in the mist.

October - February: To enjoy the cool winters.

December - January: The Temperature goes below 10 deg Celsius.

I was only in Mumbai in transit to Sri Lanka. I really enjoyed the flight in but you pass all the slums on the outskirts of the airport, there's thousands of them... It's also my first sight of the Indian Ocean and I'm looking forward to some beach time.

I hope to be back here in a couple of months before I head to China.

Delhi belly & me Some things I've come to expect when travelling, it's just part of the adventure when you leave your front door to step on that plane, occasionally a bag might get delayed, it might even get lost completely, flights get delayed, flight food is not great, bugs bite, sunburn, an upset tummy from the change of environment, when I say an upset tummy I mean a little off. It's no big deal right? poop happens! Well I'm here to tell you it is a big deal, welcome to our blog Delhi Belly & me. Our blog as Delhi Belly and me are still travelling together, in-fact this is my fourth day (I've only arrived here on Saturday and by the Tuesday I had the poops but no big deal right? Wrong!) By Tuesday my husband Chris who has also been suffering with the poops calls the doctor at 3am, after I have been up all day and night throwing up, pooping, hot sweats, cold shakes, headache, when your pooping and throwing up at the same time literally I can assure you it's not fun! For anyone. Twenty minutes later a very nice lady doctor arrives asking why I'd not

had medical attention before now, you need antibiotics it's food poisoning, gave me an injection to stop the sickness and cramps (very scary, I'm not keen on injections at the best of time, let alone in India, I had no option but to agree after asking Chris to check the packaging is sealed and in date, no panic of course :-s) She gave me rehydration salts & two other medicines and said to call if we needed her again, again I'm thinking, I was rather hoping not :-s lol, that I should start to feel better in five days, I've five days worth of medicine and I can eat fruit & yoghurt and toast, no animal products. Which is fine with me as I'm not sure I'm going to ever eat again lol. Figures state around 30% of travellers to warmer places will experience traveller’s diarrhea, more affectionately known in my case as ""Delhi Belly"" I know what your thinking, why does this happen? (I can also hear you laughing! ) ;-)Well I have one word for this and it's ""Poverty"" and where there is poverty, there is generally poor hygiene and sanitation, meaning the food and water could be
UploadedFile11
contaminated. Our hotel is certainly less of a risk and a lot more safe than the street stalls you are advised to stay away from, we have been very careful, had a couple of very nice meals in our hotel and a nice lunch at a recommended restaurant one afternoon, then I couldn't eat a thing, just wasn't hungry. The problem you see is you can take all the precautions you can but you are only as safe as the last person to handle your food or the last fly to land on it! Or the last rodent to run across the top of your water bottle ( which I have been sanitising before drinking from). Whilst its still best practice to be careful I do feel like I'm playing Russian roulette a little. I've backed packed through some remote places and been fine yet I'm only here a few days & bang! If I believed in luck I'd be saying unlucky. Here are some facts for you Malnutrition42% of India’s children below the age of three are malnourished, almost twice the statistics of sub-Saharan African region of 28%World Bank estimates this figure to be 60 million children out of
UploadedFile12
a global estimated total of 146 million.Although India’s economy grew 50% from 2001–2006, its child-malnutrition rate only dropped 1%, lagging behind countries of similar growth rate.Malnutrition impedes the social and cognitive development of a child, reducing his educational attainment and income as an adult.These irreversible damages result in lower productivity. High infant mortality rateApproximately 1.72 million children die each year before turning one.The under five mortality rate and infant mortality rate indicators have been declining, from 202 and 190 deaths per thousand live births respectively in 1970 to 64 and 50 deaths per thousand live births in 2009.However, this rate of decline is slowing. Reduced funding for immunization leaves only 43.5% of the young fully immunised. Infrastructures like hospitals, roads, water and sanitation are lacking in rural areas. Shortages of healthcare providers, poor intra-partum and newborn care, diarrheal diseases and acute respiratory infections, also contribute to the high infant mortality rate. DiseasesDiseases such as dengue fever, hepatitis, tuberculosis, malaria and pneumonia continue to plague India due to increased resistance to drugs. And in 2011, India finally developed a Totally drug-resistant form of tuberculosis. India is ranked 3rd among the countries with the most number of HIV-infected. Diarrheal diseases are the
UploadedFile14
primary causes of early childhood mortality.These diseases can be attributed to poor sanitation and inadequate safe drinking water in India.However in 2012, India was polio free for the first time in its history. Poor sanitationAs more than 122 million households have no toilets and 33% lack access to latrines, over 50% of the population (638 million) defecates in the open. This is relatively higher than Bangladesh and Brazil (7%) and China (4%).Although 211 million people gained access to improved sanitation from 1990–2008, only 31% uses them. 11% of the Indian rural families dispose of child stools safely whereas 80% of the population leave their stools in the open or throw them into the garbage. Open air defecation leads to the spreading of diseases and malnutrition through parasitic and bacterial infections. Inadequate safe drinking waterAccess to protected sources of drinking water has improved from 68% of the population in 1990 to 88% in 2008.nHowever, only 26% of the slum population has access to safe drinking water and 25% of the total population has drinking water on their premises.This problem is exacerbated by falling levels of groundwater, caused mainly by increasing extraction for irrigation. Insufficient maintenance of the environment around water sources,
UploadedFile15
groundwater pollution, excessive arsenic and fluoride in drinking water pose a major threat to India's health. Rural healthRural India contains over 68% of India's total population with half of it living below poverty line, struggling for better and easy access to health care and services.mHealth issues confronted by the rural people are diverse and many - from severe malaria to uncontrolled diabetes, from a badly infected wound to cancer. Rural medical practitioners are highly sought after by people living in rural India as they more financially affordable and geographically accessible than practitioners working in the formal public health care sector. Interesting facts I thought ..... The majority of cases of traveller’s diarrhea are due to bacterial infections, with E. coli accounting for the majority which usually causes a mild case of the poops and get better in a few days, with or without treatment. What I am suffering with is much worse, and was likely caused by some sort of bacteria but without samples we will not know which one & samples are not routinely taken here in India we were told. Whist not the most enjoyable or comfortable moment of my travelling experience through the years, I am sure
UploadedFile16
it will certainly be one of the most memorable and a birthday for Chris to remember for years to come, it was his birthday the morning we called the doctor out and we had to cancel the evening celebrations, so we will celebrate in the weeks ahead. I don't think I'm obsessed when it comes to hygiene when travelling but I do use common sense and some caution, as well as some preparedness. 'Boil it, bottle it, peel it, cook it hot hot hot or not! forget it' as I was once told still makes a heck of a lot of sense. Let me give you a few tips..... Can I shower in the local water – yes, just keep your mouth shut and I would say eyes too, I'm taking no risks, oh & no snorting it up the nose lol Are the ice cubes ok -no no no no not worth the risk! Most likely made with tap water not bottled water, unless you want to play a game of Russian roulette remember If I eat all the local food and drink the local water at the beginning of my trip, will I become immune – I doubt it, I read that it takes an averages of seven months to build up an immunity, how true this is I have no idea but who has the energy to keep getting sick, I'm not counting on it. Remember not all diarrhea is infectious so no need to panic. Too much sun, hangovers, fresh fruit you're not used to and lack of sleep can all contribute to the poops and if it's bacterial or viral I am sure you will know about as I did. My top tip if I were to give one would be to drink plenty of bottled water, check it is sealed and sanitise the top before drinking from it and by plenty I mean plenty, dehydration sets in quickly and as the majority of us do not drink enough water to begin with remember you are already dehydrated the minutes you land in your destination! Water water water ..... Chris is sensible when travelling and some people can break all the rules and be fine, he says I'm quite anal (excuse the pun) which is quite annoying when I still get sick! Oh the joys of travelling. I wouldn't change a thing apart from wishing I'd not got the bug of course, the magic, mystery & adventure of travel is far too great to miss because of the fear of Delhi belly, I will just shed some weight ;-) lol oh and have the best time once I can leave the loo for a few hours :-) Our hotel have been amazing, they called to check on us and sent us flowers and a get well card and a birthday card for Chris and we received flowers from Chris's colleague, they really can't do enough for us. The service is the nuts :-) I'm going to rebook my visits once i'm feeling better and Chris is better & back to work, I've still so much to see & do, very thankful we're here for so long. Have an awesome day peeps and keep smiling :-)

India 16th May
Yesterday I sat around the pool, soooo hot, the pool boy bought me a cold cloth, a face spritz and a bottle of cold water every now and then. The pool has resident crows that love to bathe in the flowing waterfall by the pool side and in the whirl pool, they seem to love it, keeps them fresh and cool as they fly around afterwards like small children running through a hose pipe, I remember my mum doing that with us in the height of summer when we were little. Fun times. As I watched the crows and smaller birds one flew over my sun longer and pooped on my towel, thankfully on my towel and not me and the pool boy laughed such a lot and changed it for me, his enthusiastic laugh was making me laugh even more, so funny. As the wet crows flew overhead the water drips off their wings, I kept wondering why and how I was getting wet at first lol. All settled I kept hearing a screaming like noise and looking up I saw something that was both amazing and disturbing, a scream like noise followed by a large

bird diving down from great heights to catch another bird in flight, it tossed it around in the air before flying off with it, I assume some sort of hawk, if anyone knows what this would be I'd love to know. I hear this sound a lot around the hotel. The crows bathe in the pool & fountain area, I wonder, how can it be that these crows actually have access to more water than the majority in India? It is so hot I can only just dip in and out of the sun, two dragonflies appear to be playing over the pool ( could be mating but I like to think playing as they look far to beautiful and delegate for such things lol ) we also have a resident cat, scruffy white and beige thing, it hid under my chair stalking the birds which it never catches, I made a hissing noise at it and it banged it's head under my chair, ran off and just looked t me as if to ask where did you come from lol , it was actually quite funny, it looked like it had such a frown on its face. Having had

a very relaxing day by the pool & booked into the hotel spa for a massage it made me think, I'm surrounded by all this flowing cool water, I am handed free bottles of. Old water by the pool boy, fresh col fruit and a spritz and only yesterday a little boy in the street near to the Gateway of India wasn't asking us for money or anything material, he just kept asking for our bottles of water that is all he wanted, bottles of water that cost me 20p for a litre!! Really made me think. Especially as I'm about to sit down to a Thai curry & steamed rice. I wonder how many bottles of water the street stall stocks & if I can fit it all into the boot of our drivers car. There are protests and security warnings today so I am unable to explore the areas I wanted to, so re planning my trip. We're off to get some suits made for Chris later in the week, they are amazing, handmade and really good quality. We've dinner with locals which i'm really looking forward to.

Hello from India Well, we've been here three days and my tummy knows about it lol Flight was good as flights go, jet airways service was good & as airline food goes it was pretty good, great to have the added space in business class especially with all the smells & people did seem to like to clear their throats which was disgusting, thank goodness for earphones :-) The hotel is amazing, it was a little scary arriving, very high security alert having terror warning, we were dropped off at a concrete barrier and they took all our bags for screening, our driver was not allowed anywhere near the hotel, then we walked to the entrance through more security screening & bags scanned. We didn't know what was happening but suspected as the alert came in whilst we were travelling but it is fine, I actually quite like the security, far better than the alternatives. It's like a gated development with security cameras & look out towers on the corners, I took some pics where I could. Our driver is lovely, on Sunday he took us to Ghandi's house in Mumbai which was incredible. Just walking on all this history. We
UploadedFile1
had a tour of the gateway to India and the surrounding areas yesterday, there is a festival on so very busy. Took some pics but not many, we had to dash out of the car & back in again as we got hassle for money etc everywhere, a little threatening but extremely interesting. Travelling around in our car I felt so sorry for the children knocking on the car windows. I tried to put the window down to take pics but it only goes halfway down. Chris seemed more concerned than I, mostly I think because he usually just sees the airport & hotel, I feel like I should have an electronic tag on my ankle lol ;-) just kidding as I know to be careful. We visited the area where the whole of Mumbai come to do their washing, oh my, I thought I saw poverty in China! Great pics here from the bridge.We went into the area but decided after I drew an audience & far to much attention for comfort to leave prompt & casually walked back the way we came & up the steps to our driver holding the car door open for us and off
UploadedFile2
we went for lunch. Lunch was interesting, I was told was mild & it blew my head off lol, soooo spicy & after my spicy beans & spicy egg at breakfast I think my tummy was shouting at me! We had Chinese our first night in one of the hotel restaurants and I never thought I'd hear myself saying is this spicy or mild in a Chinese but wow it was hot lol so he made me another so funny & they were all laughing at me, glad I could entertain the staff ;-) lol The Indian restaurant in the hotel is fantastic, the spices are tasty, portion sizes are quite large so they make us half portions or say we should share a dish as the sizes are what they call family portions. We learnt last night how to eat as they do in India with no rice but with our hands and the dish, very filling, at home we would have eaten much more at our local Indian, here its not necessary and is ample. It's a real mix here & once you can get your head around the poverty, people hanging out of buses & trains & cows in the street sharing food with goats & humans ;-s lol oh & the smells! then It becomes a place of intrigue & beauty, the people are always smiling :-) and we have an amazing view of the Arabian sea from our room, they upgraded us with it being Chris's birthday on the 17th and our anniversary on 30th and the hotel has arrange a nice place for us to go for dinner which is very cool, the staff know use our name here all the time it's amazing how they remember each time, even in the hotel restaurants when we leave yet we've not seen that person on entering. Anyway, today I'm in the hotel and spending time by the pool, beautiful weather, people are very friendly & helpful. I'm heading out on tomorrow with a personal guide /security into the slums to take photos, I want to document the poverty here, the scales between poor & rich is incredible . I bought a book yesterday called ""if I were rain"" amazing book, all profits go to the charity, www. Youthreachindia.org I'm keeping a diary of my time here & I'm attempting to document my visit, well the best I am able to from a photographic perspective. Off to the Taj Mahal this weekend, we will fly there & back and then its Bangalore for a couple of days and then Chennai for a couple of days too rather than stay in Mumbai alone & I'm hoping to get to Jaipur but with my guide. I aim to do as much travelling around India while I can and having a guide/security is kind of cool as they tell me the stories to go with the places too. We look out from our window overlooking the Arabian sea and there are hundreds of people that gather on the rocks each evening to watch the sunsetting, which is awesome, very early in the mornings there are lots of fishing boats and they are fishing in the traditional method using just netting. I really can't help but love India & the people, it's just such a colourful place Keep smiling & have an awesome day :-) xo

Sunday arrived in true Sunday fashion, with a stinking hangover after frequenting the Stone Water Grill, in Koreagan Park, yep you guessed, over done it again!

So I got the phone call that everyone was down stairs waiting on me so off I set. I thought, well its my last weekend so why not go all out, off on the road again on the bikes. I am glad we got the Scooter this time as it was comfier and my backside felt quite bruised at this point from all the bumps we had gone over on these roads the day before.

Again the culture was different with all sorts of stalls and brick-a-brack stalls all assembled up the roadside, and I have got to say a long way across the city, it took us around 2 hours to get across the city in that traffic and that was on bikes, you would need all day in a car!!

We arrived at the Zoo and this place was amazing with all sorts of creatures, things I would probably never dream of seeing like Cobra, White Tigers and Indian Elephants.

After seeing all the different sights at the Zoo
DSCF9947
we decided to travel a bit further to the Corinthians Oriental Bar where I got Scrumpy Jack for 70 rupees a pint, absolute bargain, this place is outside Hardapsar if you want you know lol.

After a couple of pints we headed back to the Apartments to enjoy some English Football and a few pints, a fantastic end to a fantastic weekend and one I will not forget.

Thank you to the lads: Rakesh, Sunny, KK, Suraj and Ajay to treating me to a fantastic experience here in India and making me feel like I am already Indian on my last weekend here in a beautiful country. I will miss you guys terribly................................

Well what a time I have had this week with Frank and Sam, cracking guys man! Training is going really well, I am so proud of the team and how much progress they have made.

We have been out and about sampling the wares of the streets and the works of the canteen. That is an experience in itself lol. But hey its well cheap. Suechzan what ever and all the ginger tea in the world.

So any way back to what I have been up to.

Well I decided to go to Lavasa City with the lads, Rakesh, Sunny, KK and Suraj, they said that they were going to take me to the most beautiful place in Maharashtra, and they are not kidding, this place was stunning and blew me away, a little peice of Italy in a wilderness of sand and dust, just like an oasis of calm in the hustle and bustle of the biggest country I have ever visited.

We had proper Italian Iced Coffees and done a bit of sight seeing but the biggest thrill was the bike ride there. An ecstatic journey through all the little villages and when we stopped
Photo 13
to pick wild mango off the trees and just sat and ate by the roadsdie that was excellent! We also went Air Rifle Shooting ( I am sure the sights were out lol) that was a great laugh and then set off on the journey home in the dusk. This was a great experience which really drove home the diversity here in such a huge country.

I eventually got home 2 hours later after ""chunnering"" through the rush hour traffic, but also a a day I wont forget where I witnessed some amazing sights and beautiful awe inspiring landscapes.

We have decided to visit Rajiv Ghandi Zoo tomorrow to see some of the Indian wild animals, including an White Tiger, Snake Pit and Indian Elephants, I wonder what is around that corner........................

Asia » India » Maharashtra » Mumbai
May 5th 2012
Published: May 24th 2012


Fishermans village
Another area that was attacked by terrorists in 2008, also where the majority of the market seafood comes in
I am right in the middle of that fantastic (and HUGE) book Shantaram, which as I am sure a lot of you know plays out in India’s financial capitol of Mumbai India (formerly know as Bombay). 14 million people strong, with about 800,000 of them living in Asia’s largest slum Dharavi, Mumbai is a kaotic mashing of culture, religion, poverty, history and deep seeded values that predate any western way of life. The air is thick with a modern India and contrasts are everywhere.



Stepping off the plane I felt I had no idea what to expect or what I was walking into. As with many of the cities we have ventured too there is always this day or two of unfamiliarity as you walk the streets and learn what is what and where. Here in Mumbai, as with most places in India, it feels like no matter which way you turn there is always something around each corner that opens your eyes just that much more. For me it’s the level of poverty, and from what I have learned the almost denial that it exists. A cast system that is very evident and hard to understand.
Laundry!



We chose to stay in the Kar Danda area, which is west of the airport, south of the more popular Coloba area and offered a good mix of local immersion and some luxuries (like a modern coffee shop and restaurants offering some western foods). Walking down the streets we where able to really grasp how the locals live, seeing first hand a day in the life of the general population. Early morning offered the same hussle and bussle you expect from any city waking up with added twists like the morning cattle strolling to work (or eating or just strolling really) mounds of traffic honking and forcing their way around the city and many of the local business opening shop. Many of these business are actually road shacks that are, in this writers opinion, the heart of the action offering everything from mounds of bananas, breakfast options on moving carts to virtually anything you can imagine a person needs. All based out of shacks that look to fall down if a wind gust was too strong. Being in the Kar Danda area, which I understand is not that far from one of the larger slums, I learned that
Taj and Gateway
in fact these side shacks supply a needed trade to the many folks that live on that side of the system, where a fierce competition is not evident and bribes to local police often will determine the success or failure. In the evenings as we wandered we realized that many of the side shacks also doubled as home for the shopkeepers. The senses are bombarded with the many auto-rickshaws and taxies moving the masses of people around, the build up of traffic and the constant honking…..I need to emphasize the constant honking. It’s as if each vehicle honks in a percussion of battle over each other never to be out done by the other and really offering no value but to make noise. Regardless of the “Silent Zone – No Honking” signs posted everywhere.



An evening taxi ride that proved communications could be difficult had us traveling all over the city. This will forever stand out in my mind as an exhausting, eye opening bombardment of the life of Mumbai. Stating that we moved on average a few feet at a time is pushing it and although we are in the relative safety of the
:D
I know, great shot eh ;)
cab, the slow moving crawl along the insanely busy streets exposed us to some of the true natures of this city. I distinctly remember being stopped at an intersection for what seemed like an eternity, watching two younger boys in their mid teens who lived under the causeway concrete structure. Having to look twice and feeling awful for staring although I could not look away it was clear they suffered from some of the worst that life here offers. Their legs, arms and heads looked to be burned, scarred and marked up in ways that only a form of abuse or disease can achieve. One of them missing limbs. Both mindlessly chatting away as one boy cut the other on the arm (it was dark and not evident why). What took me back, as we pulled away, was one of them looked up with a toothless smile. That one smile I think clarified what in the book Shantaram, one of the characters describes Indians as having love for Indians, using this to describe one of the ways that a population and culture can survive with the sheer numbers that exist. Being here in Mumbai I thought of this example often
Local Street
as I interacted with this world. That no matter what level you may live at, love is there and is key to everyday life. I write this not too sure if I understand it yet, but I am working on it. Its something I still can’t wrap my head around, how life can be lived in such conditions and I fully see my own naïve perspective showing here, and working hard to understand the level that people can survive.



As we explored the various tourist spots, local centers and markets something stands out. I can only describe it as the tourist becomes the attraction. On several occasions we where asked to have our picture taken with the local families, cautioned by guides to only allow fa ew so not to let it get out of control. It was explained that many of the folks we thought where local in fact are many of the villagers, who come to the big cities with eyes full of western tv or magazine posters and images. Many who have never seen a foreigner and feel honored to take back pictures of them with us. Although we will never know the stories
Elephant Caves
Solid rock carved out hundreds of years ago
that get told back home of the pictures that they take, its explained that it becomes a highlight of there adventures in the big city. This brings out a very obvious point; there are not many western foreigners in India. Most of the tourism is sourced locally and we most certainly stood out which was emphasized by these picture exchanges. Many of the Asia countries embrace the dollars that are brought in by foreigners, where they have setup shop to cater to these crowds. However India is not like this, even in the many attractions like the Taj Palace or Gateway to India. In fact I felt more often then not a struggle of many of the locals to provide service to us, a good example being the auto-rickshaws. Often they would refuse the ride, mainly I think because of the level of literacy that exist, or perhaps a cultural difference where by our own nature we gently offend by our clothing or lack of cultural understanding. Others however showed the “aggressive hospitality: I spoke of earlier. One such soul ran up to us during a rather difficult exchange with a taxi driver. A stranger who appeared off the street
Taj Palace
Attacked by terrorists in 2008
asking if we where ok and the treatment from the driver was acceptable. The man took it upon himself to ensure the driver understood where our destination was, and eagerly gave me his name and number offering to be called upon again if we had any trouble in “his city”. This was not the first local eagerly offering assistant but most certainly the most enthusiastic that we must see Mumbai the way he sees it. Absorbing that event we felt that many of the locals have such a pride for their country/city and are offended when one a local does not present that to others, as they should.



Leaving Mumbai and making our way to the northern capitol of New Delhi. Feeling such an accomplishment that I can navigate this city, knowing that I can get myself around and although it may prove to be difficult I can still do it. Coming here had me feeling a bit anxious, not knowing what to expect, now leaving and feeling that although there is still so much to see, I did what I could at a level that did not involve the J.D Marriot, custom foods and a driver.
The ""No honking"" sign
Usually ignored
I walked the streets at night, ate the local food and mingle with the folks on the street. I challenged myself to see through different eyes and kept an open mind. Glad I never had to call my street friend, it felt good to know that I could reach out if needed.



I leave this great city not sure when I might return. I do encourage anyone that decides to visit to step away from the western luxuries we are used to and step into local life. Mumbai is quite the contrast to other parts of India, a city that I only scratched the surface of, but has left an impression on my life.

There was nothing better than to blow away all the cobwebs from the night before to go into the city and explore a little bit of history then go shopping.

We arrived at the palace at around 15:30 just outside the hottest part of the day and the stalls were beginning to open again as they close from 1pm until 4pm due to the extreme heat.

We had a walk around the Palace and its gardens which has pretty much been destroyed from uprisings in the past, but you can still see a bit of the British influence here in the decor around the city. They hold fountain light shows here every evening giving you an insight into the history of the city, which is quite interesting.

After our tour of the gardens we decided to go shopping on the market. The market is absolutely huge and there were hundreds of people all hustling for the bargains and with it being wedding season it was particularly busy.

I got my haggling head on (I am quite used to this now lol) and the first thing I saw was a guy selling ""Bongo"" drums. We have a full
DSCF9914
set at home and this one was going to complement the set. he wanted 600 rupees for it, which is about £8, so i said to him ""No way, 350"" he did not want to budge, he said, ""I have got kids to feed, you are a tourist"" lol well he didnt get the sale so I walked away. 30 minutes later I heard him behind me and he gave me the nod as if to say do you want to try again, so I said 200, he wasnt having it, I said to him, my team are saying I should offer you 150, so I will give you 200, he agreed with a grimace, so I got my drum for about £2.50, bargain! Then I got a pair of shades for a pound, another bargain.

The market was amazing, and I would definatley recommend anyone who visits should go there, I wonder what else will be in store for the rest of the week................................

Well the day had to arrive, it was Mohans last night with us here in ""Rocking Pune"" and I was feeling a bit under the weather after having an eating competition with Mr Purdom and we tried to demolish the WTF Burger. I honestly could not get over the size of this thing, it had to have a chopstick put right through the middle so that it would stay in one peice. I won though! I didnt finish it but got down to just 2 burgers lol.

EXL had put on a bit of a do for Mohan at Sicilia's, what a night. We didnt pay to get in and all the drink and starters were free. So lets say I tried to get one of everything on the bar.

The shots started and that is the last thing I remember. Mohan has said that I got a bit emotional and that it took him an hour to get away from us. John had to make sure that I got to my room as I had fell asleep in the Kids play area at the hotel, waiting on everyone else.

What a send off Mohan had. The EXL
Photo 30
guys were fantastic and they wanted me to join them afterwards supposedly to continue partying. Sneha said that she did not get back home until 10am the following morning. Thank god I did not go, I would still be suffering now.

We had arranged to meet up with the EXL team the following day to go to the Palace and then off to Laxmi Road Market, something that I have wanted to do now for a while so read on........

Wednesday arrived and we were so excited, we had a traditional Hindu wedding to attend. You can imagine the rush to get all of our traditional wedding clothing, it was a nightmare, especially for me as everything was in Asian sizes so an XL is a L and so on.

We arrived at around 8.30 pm to a beautiful outdoor arena near the military base in Pune and WOW, there were hundreds of people there. The minute we arrived we were sat down and food and drinks were brought to our table. Then a man arrived and wrapped a traditional Hindi Head dress on me and John. This is a mark of respect in there religion and we were welcomed in to the crowd as if we were a member of the family.

The Bride and Groom looked fantastic with their lovely attire with some tremendous work adorned on them. We were invited onto the stage to have our photographs taken with the happy couple, it was great.

After that we settled down to a vegetarian meal, which tasted absolutely fantastic and then the dancing started, yes you read right Dancing. They had me jumping around, water and
DSCF9835
money getting thrown around, it was a great atmosphere, I did not want the night to end and that was without a drink lol.

We ended up back at the apartments absolutley knackered, not even a night cap. I have got to say, again, this was a fantastic experience and I will probably never experience that again.

Mohan leaves for the UK tomorrow which is going to be quite sad as he has become one of my best mates whilst I have been here, but still 2 weeks for me which means more adventures, more photos and more laughs.

So keep following and I will be sure to blog some more..............................

Sunday was hangover day, I should not of had so many Cosmopolitans the night before lol. All self inflicted though.

I had arranged for us to meet with Anshul, Ashraf and Vikram for a day out in the city. Food and Drink and a little bit of shopping!

We started off in the Bistro at the apartments and then moved on to 1000 Oaks Restaurant where we sampled some cocktails and traditional food.

When we finished we hit the shops. I was looking to get 2 new suits tailored and god did I find them and what a price! The finest of materials and they were very professional. Of course I got to haggle with them and got the 2, 2 piece suits, 3 tailored shirts with french cuffs and a split collar, £290, I would pay £800+ at home, I cant wait to see them next Monday.

I am also looking for a traditional Hindi Wedding outfit as we have an invite to attend one on Wednesday evening, that will be great.

After shopping for Suits, and Pashmina's we ended the evening by going for supposedly the best Bhuriyani in Pune, Georges Restaurant it was

nice but very filling. This put a great end to a great weekend and I am off tomorrow so I will be doing nothing but chilling out all day. Be sure to keep following and browse all my pictures at the bottom of my blog.



Thanks

Pune, India

Saturday started with just the way I had imagined it. We had been planning all week to go and explore the rural side of Maharashtra and get to see how the locals really live.

Rakesh, KK, Sunny and myself had decided that we would visit Pune Dam and then take a trip up to Sinhagad Fort (The Lions Fort), we were in for an experience that we would never forget.

The plan was for Rakesh, KK and Sunny to arrive at the Oakwood Apartments on their motorbikes, oh yes motorbikes! They arrived at about 12pm which meant we had all day out and about. We were so excited, so off we set. The adrenaline rush was amazing, especially when we joined the main stream traffic, I have got to say that at first it was hair raising but after a couple of minutes we new we had professional riders in control.

We weaved through the traffic and some of the sights we saw on our way out of the city, were truly unbelievable. I tried snapping as much photos as possible as I dont know whether I will have an experience like this again.

We arrived at
038
Pune Dam, this place was beautiful, the water looked so inviting and if I had, had shorts on then I probably would of jumped in until I was told that 2 months ago they pulled a crocodile out of there OMG!!! I looked along the shore line and seen a Camel, that was it! I was going on it, it cost about 20p, I was a bit anxious at first and the Camel smelled pretty bad. Off I set like Lawrence of Arabia down the shore line lol. We stayed for about 30 minutes before jumping back on the bike to set out up the mountain.

On the way I saw warning signs on the trees warning us to be aware of PANTHERS and LEOPARDS, I just hoped we didnt get stuck up there.

We arrived at the Fort, this place was absolutely stunning with panoramic views right across Maharashtra District and the history here is ancient with stories of great battles and sieges. There were a lot of stairs to climb and the heat was very intense, we climbed to the very top and when we approached the final battlement our faces were greeted by a beautiful
039
wind that had blown thousands of miles uninterrupted from the far east, it was amazing!

We headed back after spending a couple of hours up there and saw a couple of monkeys on the way down, jumped on the bikes and set of into the sunset. We arrived back in Pune at RUSH HOUR! This was crazy but exciting we got back to our apartments for 8.30 that evening, and then decided to go to Hard Rock for our evening meal. We had a few cocktails and a bite to eat then I ordered a whiskey (Double) and didnt check the price! My drink arrived, it was nice. I took a few drinks then thought ahhhh just finish it. Down it went then the bill arrived............£24 for one drink, I nearly died. That will teach me. I slept well though lol.

We arrived back and finished the night in the Oakwood Lounge sipping Cosmopolitans and planning what we were going to do the next day.

A fantastic day and one I will never forget, I just wonder what is around the corner...........

Sunday evening had arrived and we were going out for Jas' Birthday.

So Mohan and his team had arranged for all of us to go to Zafrans Restaurant in Pune. This place was looking good, it was at the top of a highrise office block (PriceWaterhouseCooper) all open air, with the night breeze and cold steam wafting through the restaurant.

Zafrans is renowned in Pune for its fine authentic Indian Cuisine, serving everything from Lobster to Paneer.

When we went, it was a Punjabi Themed evening with traditional instruments and dancing happening spuradically through the evening, they even ended up getting me up on the dance floor banging out some Bangra moves with Mohan and Gopal, what a laugh!

The meal was excellent but very rich cooked with a lot of butter and ""Ghee"". I ended up paying for it big time the following day, if you catch my drift!

After dancing and a few more of the Kingfishers (Lager), they brought Jas' Birthday Cake out from the team here. It was lovely..........................oh and the decoration was nice as well lol!!!!

Back to work tomorrow but I will be sure the blog the minute anything

happens!

Day 14 and I am beginning to miss home a bit now, I know Mohan is aswell. Can not wait to see everyone back in the UK.

So to drown my sorrows we went out to the Miami Nightclub at the Marriott Hotel. This place was amazing with traditional Indian Guards in their uniforms at the door. I have got to say, everywhere you go security is tight and when I say tight you are frisked on entry and exit to the supermarket lol.

The club was expensive to get in but we had the added pleasure of meeting the Pune Warriors Cricket Team who had played that evening and had came to ""chill"" out.

I met a lot of friendly people here and the bar staff were all up for a laugh. They had me, Anne, Ashley and Jas all up at the bar having a crazy shot of Sambuca (On Fire) put in your mouth then 2 shots of Tobasco sauce, you had to mix it all up and then swallow. No wonder I cannot remember the ride home, I love hot stuff so had some more lol.

It was a bit of a panic
009
getting out of the place as we kept getting surrounded and at one point I had lost the girls, but we eventually got out and back to the apartments safe.

Its Jas' birthday tomorrow, and we are going out again. I wonder what will happen................?

Pune - GOA


On our way!
Edmonton, Alberta ---> Frankfurt, Germany ---> Mumbai, India ---> Pune, India ---> GOA, India



I have started this journey with a very open mind, or at least a culmination of the open mind I think I have to date. Knowing full well that what I think I know will drastically change over the next months. India so far has proven to be no exception. Rae and I have been chatting about what we have left behind, what we have in front of us and where we may be in the months to come. Our worlds back home packed up in boxes, stored for some unknown future date. Leaving everything we know and love off to explore and learn about who we are as much as learn about the world in front of us. The best we can come up with so far is to plan only for today and imagine tomorrow.



My beautiful girl Raelan and I have landed here in India, more specifically Pune India to spend our first days close to some friends I had made in past lives, slowly work off the jet lag and get as comfortable as we can in
Coconuts!
Admittedly my knowledge of coconuts did not go much past the little brown hard shells. Rae has corrected this ;)
our new world. We have been exploring this old city, slowly getting our feet wet in indian culture, cuisine and the rituals of daily life. Trying to understand the many many differences from what we are used to in the west. My dear friend Santosh has been so patient educating us on many of the cultural items that are part of life here. Many conversations around how important it is to embrace the world around us, and in our case to learn and respect the various ways of this society. We are enjoying their world, guests that could, if not careful, no longer be welcome.



Here in Pune, tourism is not front and center therefore we have been received warmly but cautiously. Indian culture almost demands that guests be treated with every ounce of being and spared no expense (something that we had to really get used to as its almost offensive if you refuse). Many looks and stares from folks that are curious about who these new travelers are, with us inevitably starring right back as we absorb all that we see. Our first days riding around where spent wide eyed and quiet, auto-rickshaws are the
SOHO crew
Tequila, dancing and cricket!
way around, with a metering system that, with most things here, have both a local and foreigner rate. The level of poverty is a bit to get used to, with a large majority of the folks living off of less the 200 rps a day (about $4). Children, some deformed, run up and beg for money scurring back to their homes; in the streets in make shift huts. We knew this having been to other countries with high poverty however what does not hit you right away is the sheer volume of people who live in this fashion. I don’t think a large portion of the world can even imagine it. I write this as I look out the window and see a child no more then four begging for anything we have to offer. His father, standing next to him, selling what goods he can carry, happy to get and give a smile. It takes everything I have not to hand out every penny I have, I don’t, and fully understand that folks here are working to make things better but still. My son was four once.



My dear friend Santosh welcomed us into his family’s
Giranje Family
home, where we shared a meal, laughed and made new friends. Dipah his wife cooked an amazing meal. The cook in me wanted to jump up and help ,to learn everything I could about cooking this fantastic food. His brother spent much time chatting us up about Bollywood film (his passion) and curious about our world. Although his parents did not speak much English I could not help but feel warmly welcomed and a closely connection to everyone.



We leave Pune with a sense of comfort and confidence that the next place we land we will have a much better understanding of this world around us.



The beautiful state that is called GOA is seen out the airplane window as we prepare to land. The Lonely Planet bible explains this place was once the land of naked hippies and party go’ers. Today, it’s a fraction of that, with sound laws that limit evening’s activities, a low season that comes at the hottest time of the year and for this traveler a beautiful landscape to explore. The beach huts and beach shacks line the white sand beaches for miles. Water that is clean and clear
Small street market
with crabs and turtles running around. Renting motor bikes and taking the open road everywhere we can, exploring this beautiful piece of India all while navigating livestock and people alike on some crazy roads. We have found some of our favorite foods here with a few of the hits coming from unexpected kitchens----This is a good segway into the topic of the food. Both Rae and I are not normally happy with Indian food, not her taste and although I love it my stomach has something else to say. We both landed here very curious how we would survive the next 6 weeks. HOWEVER, have we been pleasantly surprised, VERY pleasantly surprised. The food is AMAZING – the flavors so bold accompanied by Rotis and Naans that are heavenly. Most of these delights have come from places you would not expect, beach shacks and small resort kitchens that turn out mounds of food. The kitchen at the Golden Eyes resort we stayed in near Marjim beach was by far the best and we learned on our last day that locals come from miles around to enjoy this small eateries cuisine.



So far India has shown herself as
Energy Tree
Many folks come by to sit and absorb the energy - very cool!
a beautiful rich land full of amazing people and amazing sights and experiences, and we have just started here. We quickly realized that our “must see” list has grown and six weeks may not be anywhere near enough.

The end of the second week of work, I believe we have earned a rest. Its been a very quick week and really enjoyable.

We are all going out this evening to celebrate and toast to a job well done from the L&D Team! I dont think I will be over indulging in the Amber Nectar too much this evening after my experience last weekend.

More adventures, no doubt, as I want to go City bound this weekend and of course further present idea's lol. No cricket either, the time they play at night you need a day off the following day.

Any way I will have more to talk about, as this weekend progresses so keep following...............................

Cricket Day had arrived and I was feeling a little worse for wear after the meal with the team the night before. A little bit to much beer but what a fantastic night.

There was a buzz in the air in Pune and you could tell that nearly everyone you seen was looking forward to the game as Pune had beat Mumbai the week before and a win tonight on Kings XI Punjab (Mohans Team) would put the second in the IPL League.

To top things off me and Mohan had booked the VIP Lounge to be able to watch the game in style. We could not wait for the night time to arrive. We arranged for the driver at 6pm, so we would have plenty of time to arrive (Who were we kidding lol), we left at about 6.10pm and did not arrive until 7:50pm, it was only 12km away. It was crazy, an experience in itself. You would pay for this at Alton Towers!

There were thousands of people here and I mean thousands and they love Cricket. The stadium was beautiful and what an event it was. Pune went on to beat Punjab by 22
DSCF9550
runs and the whole experience in the crowd, yep you heard right, we left the VIP to go down and join in. We were home for 1am Monday morning and man I was tired.

Overall one of the best experiences I have had in my life, would I do it again? Yes, I am going this weekend lol and join in the party.

Saturday had arrived and we could not believe that we had been here a week already. I had arranged to have members of my team to come and visit me at the Oakwood Apartments, this proved to be very enjoyable afternoon.



When the guys arrived we had a few beers and ordered some food up to the room. They had me playing Fifa 2012 and I lost lol and they were also asking me a lot about the culture back in the UK and vice versa. We waited until the ladies arrived and then set off on our travels. Rakesh and the guys took me in the car for a bit of a hair raising journey to the restaurant, as you have may be seen on the video, but again it had to be done, it was exciting. We arrived at a lovely restaurant, where we had a huge meal but an even bigger laugh. The food was really traditional and full of authentic flavours and so fresh. We were in the restaurant for around 3 hours before we all decided to go home for the night.

That was another great night, tomorrow me and Mohan are

Keep following for an update on how that has gone..............

Trip to Matheran
The ""mini-train"" chugging up the Sahyadris
On March 28th we headed to Bombay from Singapore, this was also our first missed flight of the trip. Our original flight was on Air India at 10:45am so we arrived at the airport at 9:15. However, once at the ticket counter, we discovered the flight was changed a day ago to 9:20am and we had received no notification of this change. Cheri then proceeded to have a 30 minute ""conversation"" with the Air India people explaining that just because they were supposed to call/contact everyone on the list, does not mean they did. Eventually we got a refund and rebooked on Singapore Airlines (~$100 more per ticket). This turned into a blessing in disguise as we quickly learned why SA is considered one of the best airlines in the world. They had ample leg room, attentive staff, the best airline food we ever had (and we were only in economy), and a great movie selection.

We spent the next 8 days in Bombay spending time with Cheri's parents, eating an average of 4 meals a day, meeting up with family and a 3 day trip to a ""hill station"" called Matheran. Matheran is a quaint little town, located in
Trip to Matheran
Cheri's dad and mom excited for the ""mini-train"" trip
the Sahyadri mountain ranges, ~ 2 hour drive from Bombay. No cars are allowed within this town so that the main modes of transport are either walking or on horseback. We spent the time in Matheran relaxing, watching monkeys steal food and drinks from the other hotel guests, and hiking around the forest (which according to Cheri's dad was leopard infested). Overall, a great break from our crazy travel schedule.

Yesterday (April 5) we arrived in Cochin, where we will start our Rickshaw Run on April 8 after a couple days of training and bonding with the other participants!

Murud Beach
Reason to choose Murud
Why Murud- Janjira?

1) We wanted to take a 4 day vacation to a place that could be around a 3-4 hour drive from our home in Borivali, Mumbai.

2) It had to be a place with clean beaches and very few people.

3) Although most of our 4 days were meant for lazing around on the beach, we did not mind spending a day going around exploring the place we were staying in.

Murud-Janjira met all these requirements- perfectly!



Getting There:-

Murud is exactly 170 km from Borivali's Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The route being- National Park- JVLR- Ghatkopar- Govandi- Vashi- Panvel- Karnala- Alibaug- Revdanda- Murud.

We started at 7.30 am on a Tuesday and in precisely 2 hours and 65 kilometers reached our first stop- Kamath's for breakfast.

This was exactly the mid point of our journey in every way- Distance and Time!! Since the Check in time at the resort was noon and we had every intention to enjoy our drive liesurely.

After a sumptuous and ideal south indian breakfast and coffee, we hit the road again at 10:15 am.

The journey from
Coastline Begins...
The coastline begins at Revdanda
hereon is smooth, relaxing and enjoyable provided you are in no rush; For while you are serenaded by the coastline post Revdanda; on two occasions you crawl through narrow village roads- first after Karnala when you drive through Pen and second- just before entering Murud when you drive through the narrow and rustic lanes of Nandgaon. It is indeed a pleasure to observe the sparse yet spacious dwellings, rickety yet well stocked kirana shops and the pace of life as people go about their daily existence in these places.

Having taken in the sights and sounds of our 170 km journey we drove into Golden Swan Resort fifteen minutes past noon. The journey had taken us 4 hours plus a 45 minute halt for breakfast at Kamath's.

Stay:-

We had booked ourselves at the Golden Swan resort which is definitely over priced as was evident from their rates and the various blogs and reviews on the net. However it is the only resort that is right on the beach. The other close contenders like Sandpipers and Sea Shells don't even come close to this place.

Being a fan of the cottages system of accommodation- our two
Golden Swan Resort, Murud.
room AC cottage that cost us 6000/- p.n (minus food) was extremely comfortable and cozy. Especially since it was one of the two cottages with the best view of the beach!!

Eat:-

Golden Swan food was by all means tasty and the service was no less than excellent. However, it was definitely over priced but again not as much! Besides since lazing around was the mantra of our trip we intended to have most meals at the resort. Also, Murud is largely under developed when it comes to food.

Ask anyone for a good place to eat and there is only one name that pops up. From the watchman of the resort to the coconut vendor on the road, all unanimously suggest the same name when it comes to food- Patil Khanaval! It is the quintessential place to eat in Murud. On our one day reserved for exploring the town we did raid Patil Khanaval and despite the hype and the rush it did not come even remotely close to a plenty of popular thali fish food joints in Mumbai! It was not bad at all but definitely not close to the best fish food i have
First Lunch

had under similar settings. Surmai, Pomfret and Prawns were the only fish that they had and the sol kadi- a trustworthy barometer of such a place could definitely do with some tips from my mother!

Apart from Patil's, another place i had heard of was- The Sandpiper Resort. Half a kilometer away from Golden Swan, it is located on the opposite side of the beach like all other resorts and is on a hillock. On reaching the place i was immediately relieved for not staying here as the beach is definitely not close to the rooms and the resort too looks as if it has been perpetually under construction! The food here, however, was the best i have had at Murud. We reached the place at 3:00 pm. The resort looked deserted with only Mr. Philip- the manager and a couple of waiters in sight. A piece of cardboard that hung discreetly on a nail declared lunch to be closed at 2:30 pm but no one(Waitor or Manager!!) even hinted at this as we made ourselves comfortable! The food was tasty, sumptuous and not at all expensive by resort standards. The aerial view of the beach only added to
Yeh jo desh hai mera...
In the sail boat filled with 20 people in supreme heat heads to Fort Janjira
the experience.

Place to see-

Janjira Fort is the obvious must see here. After all, this fort 'is' the “Janjira” in 'Murud-Janjira.' The rest of the town is simply Murud! The word- Janjira- comes from the Arabic word- Jazeera which means an island and since the fort is built on an island, such is its name. Trivia apart it is a magnificent site and a feat of accomplishment that needs a visit by all means.

The fort has to be reached via sail boats which charge either Rs.20 per seat or Rs 600/- for a private boat of say 4-6 people. The catch in the Rs. 20/- boat is that, it does not leave for the fort until at least 20 people or so have gathered and it comes back from the fort after 45-50 minutes meaning which, you have to finish seeing the fort in that much time or you miss your boat! In that case you have to then summon a boat especially for yourself and the charge for that is---yes!---Rs. 600/-!!

The most ideal thing is to get in a Rs. 20/- boat and hire the boatman as your guide. This is the
Janjira
An enchanting and mysterious Janjira looks on as we approach.
offer that the boatman makes himself. The guide charges Rs.800/- for his services which can be divided by the number of people from amongst all of you that arrived on the boat who shall be hiring his services.

In our case, of the 20 people who came in the boat, 13 of us hired the guide and the charge came to approximately Rs. 65 per head for an entire trip of the fort along with some very interesting trivia. The guide gives you enough time to click pictures and move around by yourself. However the most important feature of this exercise- as my father pointed out to all of us- was that there is definitely no fear of the boat living without us since the boatman himself is the guide!! As such we spent a little above an hour at the fort and absorbed enough of it to savor before heading back to the shore.

After a meal at Patil's and a siesta which is a compulsory feature of our vacations, we headed for Datta Mandir/ Sunset Point as recommended to us by fellow bloggers and the hotel staff. This was a kilometer from our resort and provided
Getting off at Janjira
a panoramic view of the entire village town, sea and both the forts- Janjira and Kasa/Padmadurga. If i did known how deserted this place was going to be with comfortable concrete benches and a large ground on the hill top, i would have surely taken a pot of coffee, biscuits and a Frisbee to vile away time until the sun bid us good bye for the day. For those who will now head for the spot, i definitely recommend a mini picnic basket. Take the darshan, take your pictures, have your picnic, watch the sun melt in the sea and head back to chill again!

Finally:

Murud-Janjira by itself should not take more that 2 nights and 3 days of stay wherein you wash down a few beers and laze under the sun on the beach on the day you reach followed by your must have siesta. In the evening you walk around and chat with the locals or explore the market and take in the essence of the village.

Day 2 can be your visit to the fort, meal at Patil's, siesta and a trip to sunset point wherein the evening is occupied by some board
At Janjira
The Boatman/Guide makes an offer... we don't refuse!!
games with the background music of the sea plays along. Dinner that night can happen at Sandpipers.

Finally, the last day can start on the beach at 8:00 am wherein you swim, roll and swim more in the beach till 9:30 am and then shower and leave for mumbai by 10:30- Refreshed and Rejuvenated for the life in the city!! 😞

The Winning Team 2
Day 5 has arrived and we have been so busy, training is going brilliantly and my learners are so nice. It has been a quiet couple of days photo wise as i have been in the office working, but i have had the most amazing time.

My learners are so hungry for knowledge and I cannot believe how quick everybody is picking things up, but I am on schedule and thats the main thing.

Again the weather has been amazing and I went to eat with the locals for dinner yesterday and tried some really tasty and different foods, but the majority of people in this city are vegetarian biut that dont bother me as the Indians definately know how to cook.

With me and Mohan working different times of the day we dont see taht much of each other during the week but we are going to Hard Rock tonight for some western type nosh and we have booked a VIP lounge to watch the Indian Premier League Cricket 20/20 on Sunday evening in Pune's new stadium, Pune against Mohan part of India Punjab, that night will be fantastic.

The Sunrise
Even before I knew, the quest to mend my health had begun. I was already searching the web, talking to friends about getting back into form. Building the stamina to walk the miles in Himalyn ranges is not fool’s play. It needs meticulous & persistent efforts. You simply need to push your limits.

I was planning my diet regime & training schedule. When I realized, that universe was still conspiring to help me achieve what I wanted. My trekking buddies were planning for a rigorous moonlight trek from Katraj to Sinhgad. This trek involves a hike across 15 to 16 hills for roughly 12 – 14 kms. The experience of trekking this terrain twice was telling me that this will be the best way to check my capabilities.

This trek is bench mark for every trekker, in and around Pune. It is an experience of life time, which involves great physical and mental strength. Many have said to trek here as a part of their training programs for Himalayn Expeditions. Once you cross first two hills, there is no way option to come back. The most important part is, this is where you experience total isolation from city, though
Sihgad Fort
its view keeps you company through out... For the entire route, one would not find any third person; it’s only you and your trek-mate.

This route being so isolated, you need to carry enough water, food, first aid and emergency safety gear. So there it was, a backpack weighing around 8kgs which included about 4 liters of water. I was only getting stronger in mind to achieve this.

We gathered at Katraj Snake Park and took a local transport bus to the tunnel. The trek begins atop the tunnel. We started walking at about 11 in night from the Waghjai Temple. The first two hills - Vrindavan and Gokul are the ones which test your will to complete this. After these two hills there is no turning back. All you can do is, hold on to yourself looking at the blinking red light of TV tower on Sinhgad and keep walking.

The hike is as good as journey of one’s life, going up and down. However, soil corrosion is killing mother earth! It’s only March end, and the plants already seemed dry and soil looked cracked. This was not a pleasant view on a cool night.
Common Wolf Snake
The rightful resident of the terrain

The group consisted many first time hikers. Hats off to their enthusiasm! Another trekking buddy was here to prepare himself for Mount Everest Base Camp. The most inspiring was another trekking buddy who participates in Marathon all over the country. He had recently completed this trek in less than 8 hours and that too during day time.

The walk continued with several breaks. The water bottles were emptied and the backpack was getting lighter only technically. One has to be careful about not harming the nature, yet the rightful residents of the terrain like serpents and scorpions may make their appearance occasionally.

The second last hill is known as one tree point. The single tree atop the hill marks it territory. If the pace is right, by sunrise you should be beyond this hill.

You may choose to climb the last hill or traverse and reach the tar road. We had arranged for local transport from the junction to the city.

This achievement restored my confidence and faith and now I can definitely say, Tested, Verified, OK!





For Statistical purposes & records: The highest altitude touched was 1180 Mtrs and
One Tree Hill
lowest was 815 Mtr. Minimum temperatures recorded was 20 C. And total distance covered was close to 12 Kms. (These are approximate values)

Day 2 started with me rough as a dog, dont know about Mohan but man that Remi Martin done me in.

We decided to to visit Pune's largest shopping mall and my god it was massive, on the scale of the Trafford Centre, but cleaner! Lots of eateries and shops from Tommy Hilfiger to your budget supermarket. I got all my presents in this mall and a Mcdonalds only cost £1.20 yeee haaa!

It has been really hot today, we could not stand outside the mall for to long or we would of melted lol.

Got back to the apartments and went to the gym for an hour, that place is so high tech with all modern machinery and very helpful staff, then we started to decide where we wanted to eat this evening. we decided to eat in ""Private Dining"", so Mohan's pad was the place to eat tonight.

The meal was fantastic and all delivered straight to your room, I cant be doing this every night I will come back heavier than I left lol.

Well that has brought an end to Day 2 and an ealry night for me as the hard work

It was a chaotic half year since my South India and Goa Trips... A reconnection with myself was desperately called for. Only Himalaya could save me.

I soon started exploring several options. At least a week of peaceful trek in the laps of Himalaya was on agenda. Leave planning, fiscal pinch, bookings, training, packing... Gosh! So much to look into.

I was really excited to take it head on. Where do I begin? Where do I begin?

But where am I going? Oh Yes, I need to decide where to go in the first place!

As Paulo Coelho quotes ""When you want something, the entire universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."" I believed this principle since childhood, however, first time saw it coming true with an invitation from Youth Hostels West Bengal for Sandakphu Trek on Facebook.

A colleague, who is a native of Darjeeling, had always mentioned that this is one of the best treks in North East. Having seen the photos on internet, this became a member on my “need to visit” list.

A lot of times, I have been criticized for having travelled without informing interested people, so decided to ask a colleague-friend who was sailing in same boat. She was not sure about North East as she wanted to hit Garhwal region. Right then, my best friend, Facebook came to my help. I messaged some of my trekking buddies. For quite some time there was only silence.

So, it seemed like I was going alone. Ok! So this is it. But then again, the same principal applied here... And another trekking buddy Prajakta, replied to my invitation. Like me, she too wanted to get some bliss of nature’s beauty.

With total enthusiasm, I shared the itinerary with her. We downloaded the forms, filled them up and then it was time to send them.

And, the first hurdle made its entry; my blood pressure didn't mark to the required level. On that fateful day, the doctor denied to issue me a medical certificate & advised to make necessary dietary changes and get some drips.

Well, a trek in Himalayas always calls for a healthy nutrition and a harder training. Ok, so there I was a weak person who has an ENTIRE MONTH to correct health and get going. Entire month on hand to work on myself was something far better than good news. Other doctor issued me the certificate, and we registered for the Sandakphu Trek.

Though it was a bit late, Praj took care of all the train bookings.

Then, with a settling mind, I went to work, only to find out that my leave application being rejected. I knocked the doors of management, and yet again my will won.

So now we are set... Patiently preparing for the departure.

The guy sitting next to me picks up the indian immigration form and starts filling it out. I'm trying to peep but can't see much, so I decide to ask



- Does this form ask for an address in India?



- It does usually... let me see... ah yes!

-Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Mumbai. The temperature outside is +31C.



We walk along a worn-out empty corridor towards the international transfer desk. The pain is coming off the walls and the damp old smell lingers in the air.



- On'-ly need too see your boarding pass. Thank you. Here are the luggage tags.



She hands in three luggage tags to us. Why? Never mind. We join a queue for security screen. A military guy dressed in greenish-brownigh unifor and a black beret looks closely at my green M&S bag with the neck pillow.



- Luggage tag? Put the tag on.



Oh dear. I attach the tag to the plastic bag, but write nothing on it. The guy comes round again.



- Luggage tag?



- I put!



- Okey.



The bag comes out of the screening machine, the tag duly stamped. Now i'm allowed to enter the waiting area.



Two hours to look at a dozen of duty free shops, visit two toilets and have a slice of apple crumble with mango juice. We have a look at the ""indian sweets"" display and I point at a box with round yellow sweets covered in something

- Emm.. nuts?



- No, no



- Cookie?



- No... milk!



- aha...



The toilets feature a small hose next to the toilet itself. So here it is, the indian toilet wash device. Luckily there is toilet paper too. A lady tells you which cabin is free, presses on the soap dispenser and waves in front of the water tap to start the water running. Shame I don't have any rupees. All in hazy headache, on board again, to Bangkok. India, I'll come back in two weeks.

Shalom: peace (used as a word of greeting or farewell).

This has got to be the hardest post to write. The team, tired, weary, recovering, and anticipating home has had to say goodbye to over 1300 students and teachers in the last 48 hours. I'm writing this post while we await our last flight home in the Seoul International Airport. There was no way that any of us were in any state of mind to write during the last few days. Let me take you back.

On Sunday we returned from the girls school. It was a short stay and it was a heartwrenching goodbye. It's amazing that when you are willing to give it all to someone how close you can get in such a short time. After only 3-days the girls were calling all the kids on the team brother and sister. For some reason, Pam, Anne, Amy, and I got the nickname Aunty and Uncle - must be age discrimination! Nonetheless we found ourselves trying to get to each student to say a personal goodbye before we left early the next morning. However, the girls at the school woke up at 3:30am the day of departure to continue their goodbyes. It really pulls on the heart-strings to see these young girls crying and saying, ""No leave"".

The grewling 12 hours that lay ahead would find each of us toughing out another train ride to Nagpur. It weighed on all our minds that we would have to see all the boys one more time. And there they were, as we entered the compound all the boys were waiting and yelling and screaming at the vehicles - they were so excited to see us.

The team decided that we were due for some much needed ""Western Cuisine"" so we made a quick pit-stop on the way home for some Dominoes Pizza. For most, it sat really well, then there were some that are still poping Imodium - its going to be a tough road getting back into the rich western food.

We only had just under a day to see the boys and get in any last minute hang-out time - we took full advantage of it! UNO games going on by the guest house. Guitar lessons on the baptismal tank. Climbing the water tower with 'The German'. And finally get the last minute photos. After a long day of travelling and emotion we were ready for a good nights sleep.

8am Monday morning and we had to be at the airport for 3pm. After breaky we had a very emotional last devotions as a team. We took a few minutes to look back at the last 2 weeks and tell of our favourite memories. The consensus - we fell in love with the kids. Every memory that was shared had something to do with the kids. Their energy, enthusiasm, and zest for life despite their desperate circumstances is contagious!

Shortly after the team decided they would head into the heart of Nagpur for some last minute shopping - gotta spend those rupees! When the team returned we had a quick last bite of Chipates, Lentils, Mixed Vegetables, and rice. Shortly after lunch, Errol said he needed to show us something. We were anticipating the arrival of the new playground equipment but minutes later found ourselves in the main dining hall with 725 boys - it was the final farewell!

Clapping and singing at our entrance, as always, they sang a few upbeat worship songs for us and then presented us each with a gift. On the wall was a massive banner titled, ""Thank You Pastor Michael and his team"". Bapu gave a speech of thanksgiving for all we had done for them. There was a lot given to the school thanks to all the support from back home - but his thank you although appreciate wasn't merited. We should be the ones thanking them. Thanking each student, each teacher, each driver, each security guard. They were the ones that made this trip possible. They were the ones that carried us through. They were the ones that showed the selfless, unconditional love of Christ.

So we wait for the last flight home. It is a grewling, long 33-hour trip back - the novelty of flying and waiting has certainly worn off. But we are returning home. The mantra for the trip was ""Let Light Shine"". Maybe we were ignorant when we thought we would be the torch bearers because the light was already shining in India and the spark in our hearts has been turned into a flame. Shine On!

See ya'll at 12:15pm.

Flight No. KE 071

India Team 2012 signing off.





Shalom.

Hey this is Tessa and Siena again … yup, they actually let us write another blog. So here we go, day 13. For most, it started with an hour-long hike at the crack of dawn. Actually it was just a few of the ‘youngling’s’ (as Pam would call us), who went on the hike to the top of a nearby mountain with some of Bapu’s relatives for guides. It was short but sweet or so we’re told, because both Tessa and I were too sick to make the trek. The adults (who, may I add, are completely insane) passed on this adventure and had a ‘calm’ rest that was supplemented by Indian Birthday cake and a song, from a young student who was celebrating her 15thBirthday.

After arriving back from their hike, the kids and the rest of the team ate a lovely breakfast and we all finally had our long over due devotions. I swear, devotions in the morning is the only thing that keeps us sane … or rather what passes for sane well Pam, Soren and Mike are on the team.

We had a busy day that day, which included playing games with girls, meeting the two puppies on campus which we named Tea and Coffee, having our nails painted and Tessa getting her long awaited henna. During the day the boys helped the workmen dig and cement in the two swing sets that we had bought for the girls. Now when you dig holes in the ground and then wet the dirt, inevitably you get mud. Three boys and a pile of mud results in EVERYONE getting muddy. At first the mud fight was contained to the boys but eventually Siena was caught in the crossfire. Let’s just say the person who got her muddy didn’t remain clean for long. After that the girls insisted on pumping water and washing our hands, legs and face to the amusement of the rest of the team.

Like the boys school, we were able to be apart of the Teacher Appreciation service, which went much like the previous one. The girls on the team helped by serving food and drinks (because the boys were still digging at this point) well the teachers on the team talked with the teachers from the school about Canadian schools, teaching styles, student life etc. Afterwards, we gave them a few small mementos from Canada (such as pins, pens and bookmarks) and thanked them for the great work they're doing.

Next we prepared for our last chapel, which would include singing songs, a dance by Kirsten and Siena, and finally a Hindi movie. The service went well, with the girls more used to singing along, and the dance going smoothly despite the cultural differences. The movie however was slightly sketch, and the team was a little uncomfortable with the beginning. Apparently this type of movie was normal for the girls, but among our team there were some murmurs of objection. Don’t worry it wasn’t too outrageous and we couldn’t really understand anything that was going on so some misinterpretation is likely.

Now it was finally time to go to sleep, and say goodbye. The girls kept repeating ‘Canada bad, stay here’ or ‘No leave tomorrow’ and I think more than a few of us would have been happy to stay.

<span>Please pray for safe journeys back to the boys school. We are all in the same class on the train this time which could be a bad or good thing?! We have ALOT of tavelling to do in the next 48 hours so pray that the team adjusts well and that God solidifies the work He is doing in each one!

Hello blog-followers! This is Kirsten and Soren (currently on a train) filling you in on what happened two days ago. P.S. Hi mom and dad. I’m alive.





Well let’s jump right into it. We woke. And what a morning it was. We ate breakfast under the towering gaze of what the team members call the great “Thumbs Up” mountain. <span> From our patio, overlooking the girls who were already finishing up their morning chores, we began to feel the heat of the sun. But no Indian sun was going to prevent this team from busting out the sports equipment that we had purchased beforehand. Needless to say, the pandemonium of excitement that followed was one of great joy. It was quickly evident to the team that these girls were no western girls. Even in their full saris they could swing a cricket bat and bowl a hard pitch. If that wasn’t enough excitement for one morning, we were quickly swept up into the vehicles and heading to the market. After a longer than expected and slightly nauseating drive, we arrived in the center of a bustling city. Upon opening the door the cacophony of city sounds rallied the team into a shopping mood. Not long after entering the first shop, which was selling bangles, we had a sizeable crowd of people surrounding us either starring or asking for “one photo”.<span> From there we went on to browsing the street vendors wares, which consisted of spices, soaps, sweets, smelly sea food, souvenirs, and to the team and Kirsten’s delight authentic Henna! With the noonday sun beating upon our heads, we sought shelter in a quaint clothing shop. The owner quickly realizing he had a small gold mine of customers in his shop and began pulling out scarfs, saris, shirts and everything in between at a frantic rate in order to keep our attention. With the women and Connor pleased with their purchases we made our way over to the silver shop. We left the shop a little shinier and our wallets barely lighter than before. Now in a rush to get home for lunch, we popped into a toyshop where some team members bought the same games that we had seen the students’ use. After a speedy walk through the veggie and live fish section of the market, we plopped into the vans, sweating and puffing. To everyone’s delight, Errol treated us to cold Coca-Colas. Unfortunately, we had to drink quickly because the owners wanted the glass bottles back (probably for the next visitors).<span> After a hot car ride home and food in our bellies, we split up into various groups to hang out with the girls. Some learned to count to ten in Marathi, while others played games like UNO and cricket. The evening came quickly and over dinner we laughed about how one of the songs we had been singing, even at the boys’ school, had been misspelled. Where we had thought we were singing, “My God is so big” the directed translation that was projected onto the screen in Hindi read, “My God is so bug”. No wonder the students weren’t singing that line with particular enthusiasm. After dinner, we had our first chapel with the girls.<span> What the boys lack in tone, they sure do make up in volume and confidence. The girls on the other hand, seem to understand the basics of melody and rhythm but encouraging them to sing with us rather than us perform is a bit more challenging. In the end everyone had a good time and if the day wasn’t great enough, Goliath was a hit as he managed to die on queue!



This is Soren and Kirsten signing out from a bumpy train heading back to Nagpur.

Day 9: Pink, Parachutes, and Prayer







We were up at 6 am on the train ride, to make sure that we were ready for our stop at around 7am.<span> Most of us were able to get a semi good amount of sleep, enough to be able to function through the day.<span> When we got to our stop we were whisked away into 2 vans and started the 1 and a half hour drive to the girls school.<span> The driving was much different than Nagpur.<span> There was hardly any traffic, but then the speeds we were travelling were a bit faster, so dodging around the occasional chickens, women, cows and rickshaws were a bit more difficult.<span> I only really feared for my life maybe once though, our drivers are very competent.<span> A very tired group of 12 arrived at the girls school at around 8:30 am to a very excited group of about 525 girls.<span> They all had lined up on either side of the road and we got the same enthusiastic welcoming that we did at the boys school.<span> Placing a lay around each of our necks, singing a welcome song, the girls had a very different demeanor than the boys did.<span> Although they have gotten much more bold even after a day, they were quite shy and reserved when we first arrived.



Our favourite breakfast so far – chapattis with peanut butter and mango jam.<span> It was delicious and scarfed down as most were very hungry from travelling.<span> We were then able to walk around the classrooms while school was in session.<span> Unfortunately we managed to time it so we entered classrooms during their “silent reading”.<span> Well… it didn’t stay silent for long as the different classes erupted into excitement when we entered.<span> The behavior here is incredible!!!<span> As soon as we entered a classroom they would sing in unison “Good morning teacher”, Pam and usually an off key Mike would sing back “Good morning students”, in which they would respond “Thank you teacher” and sit down.<span> Wow!<span> If only I<span> (Amy) could get my grade 10 students to act like that…<span> The accommodations at the girls’ school are a bit more challenging than at the boys school due to lack of money and space.<span> Each class of about 55 students use their room for a classroom during the day and as their bedroom during the night.<span> So when we came during their classes, all of their possessions in one metal suitcase each were lined around the outside of the classroom.<span> They have so little, these girls, and yet they are so joyful.<span> When we visited each classroom we had the privilege of teaching them “My God is So Big” and they taught us “Jesus power is Superpower”… at least that’s what I think they were singing…



The girls school here is a school with grades 5 through 10, and the kindergarten through grade 4 classes were at another missionary school only a walk away.<span> We were fortunate to be able to walk over and visit that school as well where we had a similar experience meeting the classes and getting to chat with them.<span> The kindergarten class was my favourite!<span> So cute!



Resting and Lunch was next, not really sure in which order since there are too many things that happen in a day and I can’t seem to remember what we did an hour ago let alone a day ago.<span> After lunch we brought out the sports equipment we were able to bring the girls here.<span> Their faces just lit up as we threw them Frisbees, volleyballs, brought out cricket bats, and introduced them to the 30 foot parachute we brought with us.<span> That was definitely a highlight, although a bit of an interesting feat with the language barrier.<span> It was a fun time playing with the girls.



The girls from the school treated us foreigners by giving us henna tattoos with a nice design, our English name and our Marathi name.<span> Very cool.<span> Hopefully it’ll last until we get home.



We were then whisked away again in a vehicle for a tour of Bapu’s (the director of both schools) village and family’s home.<span> It was very fascinating to be in a genuine village home and to see how they live.<span> They treated us as very respected guests, feeding us chai tea and roasted peanuts.<span> The best roasted peanuts I have ever tasted!<span> Our group is always loud and rowdy everywhere we go (thanks to Mike, Soren and Pam, our ring leaders), but we were graciously accepted into their home anyways 😉<span> We were able to walk through their fields, try harvesting a little wheat with a hand tool, Soren ate a hot chili pepper, and we all sampled the ripe chick pees.<span> A very authentic cultural experience in the village areas of India.



As soon as we returned from Bapu’s family’s home, we were hot, sweaty and just wanted to return to our rooms for some much needed rest…<span> But, the girls were having chapel in the hallway that led to our guesthouse.<span> We sat with them while they worshiped and were blown away by their discipline.<span> While we sat there they sang many songs, but the inspiring part was when they started reciting scripture.<span> Their superintendent of the school kept calling out scripture and the girls recited it without any hesitation.<span> Psalms, John, Romans.<span> The entire chapter of Psalm 34!!!<span> We were astonished by their ability to memorize and recite scripture, hopefully it will inspire us to follow suit when we return to Canada!



After devotions we had time for a quick washroom break and to wash our hands before starting chores with the girls.<span> Chores here were just a bit more chaotic to try to add 12 white people into.<span> Our teams’ younger girls, (Siena, Kirsten, Tessa) were surrounded by girls that just stared at them rather than carrying out their chores.<span> It gets a little awkward after awhile to say the least!<span> A few others were directed by all ages of girls fetching water from their water tank, and picking up garbage.<span> We have learned very quickly that the girls here want us to learn their names and are continually asking us if we remember their names.<span> Well, I can’t usually pronounce their name in the first place, so how the heck am I supposed to remember them!<span> We are trying our best though.



After chores we had supper at about 8:30pm and were able to take the evening off to rest and relax.<span> Luckily, here in Manjri the night air cools off to a balmy 35 degrees a lot more than in Nagpur so we were able to sit out on the roof and enjoy the scenery.<span> It is very peaceful out here at the girls school, and we have been enjoying the looser schedule (don’t say looser).<span> The daytime heat is still very unbearable and because we are so far removed from a bigger city the power goes out regularly here.<span> That means that we have no real way to cool down in the daytime with fans or anything else.<span> We are enjoying our time with the girls here, but sickness still seems to get some of the team members down.<span> Please pray for health and that we will be able to make the most of our last few days in India even through the heat.<span> We love and miss you all!







Papaya Forever.

Day 8: All Aboard!







Our train didn’t depart Nagpur until the evening – 7:10pm to be exact, so we had a little time to pack, shower, do some laundry, and play with kids.



After a much needed sleep-in we had an opportunity to get into the computer lab and check out some ESL websites and materials for the students and teachers. The heat was almost unbearable so a lot of our time was spent in front of a fan and inside. A few members of the team were feeling a little heat stroke so it was important to take a lot of down time before our train ride.



Skip a head a few hours and we were packed, rested, ‘clean’, and ready to go. We always have to take two vehicles wherever we go but one car had already had left to bring the games and sports equipment to the school so we had to use Prem’s ambulance to get us to the station. Pictures don’t do it justice but imagine 7 people squished into an ‘ambulance’ not much bigger then Pam’s mini cooper – needless to say we shared body sweat.



The train station was a gong-show. People were everywhere and the men of the group had the strict responsibility of protecting the women from inevitably bum-grazings. After proceeding through a brief security check the lot of us made our way over to Railway line 3. There are no tickets for the train, tickets were purchased a long time ago, but you just have to know the seats you booked and find them when the train arrives and hope that no one is already sitting there. No worries, if someone is in your seat, Pam will surely get them out – really low-profile Pam!



The station was hygienically subpar. We stuck close together as a team and had a few security people helping ward off the beggars. The tracks were polluted with garbage and bodily fluids and the rats here are the size of large cats.



Our train arrived and we found our seats/beds quickly. There’s not a whole lot I can elaborate on in regards to the train. Consensus is that it was better then expected in terms of overall condition. The group was split in two classes – second and third, and both had AC. Because the train was over night most of us slept. The boys handled the bathrooms ok but they would have been a little tricky for the ladies – you’ll have to ask them about it – I prefer not to hear the details. And then there was Soren. Soren decided to exercise his acrobatic skills by flipping and flopping around the upper bunks…nothing short of an elephant sedative can stop this boy! We love it!



And so through the night we travelled with occasional ‘Chai, Chai’ being yelled through the train car – for a few rupees you could have hot chai – really hot! But we all arrived safe in the hot, dry region of Navapour. We will be staying at the girls school in Manjri, about 2 hours outside Dhule (check the map for the exact coordinates).



It is evident that the second week is paying a toll on the team. We are suffering from heat exhaustion, some are getting colds, and others heat stroke. It is clear that this week will push us to the limit.



So, please pray for much needed rest. Pray that God would bless us with patience, perseverance, and renewed purpose.







From Manjri,







The India Team

Gateway to India
ELEPHANTA ISLAND, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA. Wednesday 21 March, 2012.

We were collected on time at 8.30 am by Miss Unknown and the same driver as yesterday. M asked her name and wished she hadn't - so for the rest of this blog she shall remain Unknown. We did establish that she was married with a 4 month old son and was the daughter of a doctor. She had also travelled to Egypt so she was rich by Indian standards. As she is married we will now call her Mrs Unknown.

Our destination this morning was Elephanta Island (Hindu name Gharapuri) which is a World Heritage Monument. The visibility in Mumbai today was appauling which was caused by pollution. We caught the first launch of the morning from the landing stage near the Gateway of India and the journey to the island, which is about 10 km off the coast of Mumbai, took about an hour.

Only about a thousand people live on the island which takes its name from a huge carved elephant found there in the 16th century. After we docked we walked to the nearest village where we climbed up the steep staircase that leads to a
Elephanta Caves Entrance
group of cave temples. There were plenty of monkeys and lots of dogs and puppies as we climbed the steps. One good thing was that the staircase was covered by a canopy - not to keep we tourists cool but to protect the stall holders who lined the long steps, from top to bottom, from the sun.

On reaching the top of the steps we paid our entrance fee. As usual the price was 5x more for us than for Indian Nationals. Mrs Unknown first took us to the square shrine in the centre of the first cave temple. It is carved into the rock face and dates from the 7th century. It contains a sculpture honouring Shiva, one of the three basic divinities of Hinduism. We sat while Mrs U filled us in on the Hindu Gods and whatnot. We are thinking of converting now as we are near experts on Hinduism (joking of course - there are over 30 million gods!). The central shrine houses the Linga, a cyindrical stone on a square base representing the phallus, which is venerated as the eternal source of life (which we suppose it is - at least it has a
M at Elephanta Caves
small part to play!).

There are nine carvings in the main cave, all of enormous power and beauty. The best carving is the 5.4 metre (18 ft) high panel of Shiva Trimurti (triple faced) showing the 3 aspects of the god. The features of the east profile are raging and destructive, the west profile has a gentle feminine expression and the centre full face is Shiva in his completenes wearing the symbolic Linga Headdress. Mrs U took us to all nine carvings and started the story of each with ""once upon a time ....."". We listened sometimes intently and sometimes not intently enough. We regretted the not so intently times when she gave us a test. ""Now what can we see in this one?"" Mrs U asked expectantly. We weren't too good on any of them but we have a good excuse. The Portugese had used the statues as target practice when they were in occupation of Bombay (so called as Bom Bahia means Beautiful Bay in Portugese and it was anglicised when the British took over). Therefore, most of the stautes had their faces shot off (seems they aimed more at the faces than any other part of
Shiva with the 3 Heads
the anatomy). So Shiva with his 3 faces probably had none. M was great at recognising the celestial dancers though and excitedly pointed up to the top of the carving - they were on every one so it was a good bet!

Mrs U then left us alone to wander for 20 minutes and told us to meet her at the bottom of the steps. We wandered around and found another couple of caves which had still more carvings, but the Portugese riflemen had made a really good job of these and there wasn't much left of any of them. On the way back to meet up with Mrs U we bumped into two of our tablemates, Dave and Irene, who had also stayed in Mumbai for a few extra days. We chatted for a while and then descended and found Mrs U. There is a little train that transports you from the village back to the jetty at a cost of 5 rupees each and, as it was there, we climbed aboard and chugged our way back to the boat.

Mrs U took us to a fantastic Chinese Restaurant for lunch where you can pile a lot
Second Cave Entrance
of food in a bowl and then a chef cooks it in a wok. There is a choice of sauces and you can go back as many times as you like. After lunch we went to the fishing docks where we saw the catches of the day being weighed and packed. There were old fashioned ice crushing machines that took huge blocks of ice and crushed it into small pieces. The fish were then packed in the ice and polystyrene boxes for transportation. There were all sorts of fish, from crabs and lobsters to catfish and sharks.

After the fishing port we went to the Afghan Memorial Church. The church was mainly interesting for its architecture - in particular the church tower. The church commemorated all the soldiers who had died in the Indo-Afghan wars. The pews inside the church had notches cut into them so that the worshipers could stand their rifles and pray without encumberance. The church also had several stunning stained glass windows.

After this Mrs U took us to the Discovery of India Exhibition. This museum unfortunately did not permit the taking of photographs. It consisted of two quite distinct exhibitions. One detailed through
Cafe Mondegar
models and displays how the Indian sub-continent has evolved from before pre-historic times until present day. It wa extremely well done. The other section of the museum was dedicted to the life of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first and longest serving Prime Minister. It consisted of facinating insights into his childhood in the form of photographs and letters and continued right into his adult life with letters from Ghandi and other prominent world leaders. It detailed with photographs his time in prison and all other aspects of his life.

At the end of the tour we were dropped at a bar in the downtown called Cafe Mondegar. It is famous for its juke box. There were plenty of westerners in there. We sat and had a Kingfisher and soaked up the atmosphere. The waiters were called Mondies. It was a 30 minute walk back to our hotel from the bar. We were too tired to go back to the downtown so we returned to the Barat Excellence for another good meal. We have to get up early tomorrow as we have to catch a flight to Udaipur.

It was another early morning but all were awake because of the dog-fights outside. We had work duties starting at 6:30am. A mound of sand, much larger then the first, was to be spread in the playground. With the help of several little kids (you can see them in the pictures) we were able to get the job done - ok, half done. You have to love the Indian work schedule. We worked for about an hour and then they bring us a hot cup of Chai - this is a system that will definitely need to be implemented back home!



8:00am rolled around and we had our daily breaky and devotions. A few days ago we promised the teachers of the school that we would pop by their classrooms to observe. The school is one long two-storey building with all secondary (which they called middle classes) on the top floor and the lower floor all primary students. The classrooms are a wake up call to any Canadian student or teacher. We have a lot in comparison - whether it be resources, equipment, notebooks, technology, or simply painted walls - but these teachers work under tough conditions. Despite not having any of these 'frills' these are excellent teachers. Fully credentialed, a love for their students, and good at what they do. It was great to share some resources such as books, games, etc. with them and discuss some ways in which we can help and support them and they did not hesitate to tell us what they needed!!



The other half of the team worked tirelessly in the kitchen prepping for lunch while some others worked in the computer lab with some students. The computer lab here is excellent and was donated a few years ago through the Heronbrook Foundation which generously supports the school in a variety of ways. We, as a team are working hard at researching ways that the computer lab might be more useful for ESL purposes.



The heat was overbearing again this afternoon but we had a few hours to play with the kids. The boys are certainly getting bold with us now. Initially we had a small compound to ourselves where we would find time to relax but now the compound has turned into a playground. Kids relentlessly knock on our guesthouse doors to ask for cards, UNO, or dominoes to play with in the courtyard. You just cant say no!



We spent the later afternoon in music lessons. Pam, Anne, and Amy have worked hard to teach some of the kids a few english worship songs with the hope of having them sing/play them during our last chapel. The others of the team joined in and taught the kids the actions to the songs. We had the privilege also to learn a Hindi/Marahti worship song from the music teacher, Francis.

We were all pretty tired when we got home and were anticipating a 'sleep-in' the next morning - afterall, Wednesday is surely going to be an interesting day - train departs at 7:10pm.



Please pray for the train ride. We, as a team, have adapted to new adventures very well but the train is a whole new adventure. We ask that God would calm our anxious minds and that He would keep us safe throughout the journey as He has done so faithfully already. Please also pray that each team member may receive a fresh, renewed Spirit for the girls school and that we might have the same enthusiasm and gusto that we had at the boys school.



Stay Tuned.

Later that afternoon the team practised its drama which was also going to be presented during the last chapel.



We scheduled chapel for 6:00pm. This was to be the last chapel at the boys school and the team worked hard at pulling everything together. We had three english songs ready to present, a drama, and I was to speak. The team was excited because we were also going to present
DSC01484
the kids with all the new sports equipment, mattresses, bicycles, and notebooks that we had bought for them. Not unlike every other chapel, we were welcomed in with clapping and singing - this never gets old!



The team did great with the songs and the boys all caught on really quick. We sang, ""Every Move I Make"", ""Trading My Sorrows"", and ""Your Love is Amazing"". Watching 650 kids dance and sing to these songs takes your breath away. I was so proud of Siena, Tessa, Connor, Soren, Kirsten, and Steve for presenting the drama. The kids loved it and it was difficult to leave knowing this was the last time we'd sing together.



After chapel we were heading into town for a night out at a fancy restaraunt. Driving during the day is crazy in Nagpur but driving during the night - nuts! We arrived at the restaraunt and the place was empty. In India the average time for dinner is between 9 and 10pm - we arrived at 8pm. Errol ordered which seemed like one of everything on the menu. The waiters stand behind you and every time you take a sip they

fill your water. We asked for everything to be mild this time. Needless to say, we got spicey - hence the Johnny Cash title...""down, down, down, to the burning ring of fire."" Nuff said.

Victoria Station
MUMBAI CITY TOUR, MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA. Tuesday 20 March, 2012.

We both felt dreadful but still managed to pack, then D lugged our stuff to the holding area on deck 6. D also negotiated an extra hour and 20 mins stay of execution from leaving our cabin from our cabin guy Angel (a very appropriate name as it meant we could stay in the cabin until 9.20 am instead of having to be out by 8 am). We then went to the restaurant for breakfast, returned to our cabin to shower etc. and then went up to the Discovery Bar to wait to disembark around 11 am as agreed with our Agent yesterday.

While we were waiting M decided to use our last 16 mins of internet time and found an email from Ashikur from Quo Vardis saying our Agent woud be there from 8 am. Rather than sit around for an hour or so M decided to get off and see if he was there. He was, so we got our stuff, disembarked, cleared customs (yellow gate) and were taken to our hotel round the corner (it was quicker to walk from the green gate yesterday). The hotel
Municipal Corporation Building
was called The Grand, had internet access, breakfast included and was in a great location walkable from downtown, the Gateway to India and next to the Indira Docks. We were to be collected at 1 pm this afternoon for a city tour. We went for a look around and found an ATM to get some rupees.

Our guide and driver arrived 10 minutes late. She was a sweet girl who never told us her name on this first day. The first stop was Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (Formerly Victoria Railway Station). This amazing Neo-Gothic building was designed by F W Stevens and was completed in 1887. It is an absurdly attractive, palazo-like structure and is on the UNESCO World Heritage list. It is the terminus of the Central Railways. From the ship M thought it was a cathedral. According to Miss Unknown Guide it is the second most photographed structure in India next to the Taj Mahal. We didn't go inside as apparently it is the outside that you need to see. We also saw the Municipal Corporation Building which is opposite CST and the nearby General Post Office building, both of which are similar built-to-last civic monuments.

We
Municipal Laundry
then drove past Crawford Market and the Muslim District of the city before arriving at Mahalakshmi Dhobi Ghats. This was featured on one of Michael Palin's travel shows. This is the Mumbai Municipal laundry where people send their clothes to be washed or ironed or both. All the workers here are men. The clothes are all grouped together and hanging out to dry before being ironed. There were lines of jeans, overalls, bed sheets and anything else you can think of. The whites were gleaming . The Dhobi Ghats (laundrymen) worked in large stone basins, scrubbing, slapping and soaking. Miss Unknown told us that they hardly ever return laundry items to the wrong owner. Nobody knows how they do it or how their system works. It costs around 2 rupees to have an item ironed (about 2 and a half pence) or between 4 and 7 rupees for the complete works (depending on the items). What a bargain. We should all ditch our Hotpoints and get a Dhobi Ghat!

We then visited the Jain Temple in Walkeshwar Road but it had already closed for the aftenoon. However this did not matter as it is the elaborate facade that is
Jain Temple
of interest. This marble shrine was built in 1904. The adherents of Jainism follow an austere religion developed in the 6th century by the Guru Mahavira. They hold that all life is sacred, to the extent that the most orthadox wear a veil over their nose and mouth so as not to breathe in and kill an insect by accident (wonder how they avoid treading on one by mistake?). The security guard allowed us into the outside courtyard to take some photographs.

We then went on to Mani Bhavan (The Ghandi Memorial Museum) where we spent about an hour. The museum is set in the house at 19 Laburnum Road where Ghandi undertook one of his historic fasts, precipitated by riots over the Prince of Wales' visit to Bombay in 1921. Ghandi lived here for several years and his working room (he learned how to spin here) has been preserved in all its simplicity. A mattress, pair of sandals, bowl and spoon were about all of his posessions. Alongside is a permanent exhibition of remarkably excecuted figurines depicting the major episodes in the great man's life. Gandhi was called 'Mahatma' which means 'great soul' by the Indian people. A
Ghandi's Room
spinning wheel is still an emblem on the flag of India.

Our next stop was the Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens - better known by everyone as the Hanging Gardens. These are located at the head of the mini peninsula and were first laid out in 1881. There is some amusing topiary in the shapes of animals and a good view of the harbour and the city (when you can see through the pollution). As we walked through the gardens we saw lots of hawks and other birds of prey circling in the sky. Miss Unknown informed us that they were flying above the nearby Towers of Silence which are where the last rites are performed for the members of the Parsi Community. Parsis are the descendents of Persians who migrated to India some 1,200 years ago and they follow the teachings of Zoroaster, a 6th century philosopher. Unlike the Hindus, who cremate their dead, Parsis are opposed to polluting the earth, air, water or fire so leave their dead in the towers, which are divided into sections for men, women and children. The bodies are left bare for the vultures and other birds circling above to eat. This was the
Topiary at Hanging Gardens
reason we could see so many birds of prey in the sky.

After the Hanging Gardens we went to a stretch of green known as Pope Paul (Oval) Maidan where we could see the locals playing cricket - all Indians seem to be fanatical about the game! The Oval Maidan is surrounded by many other colonial buildings such as the Rajabai Clock Tower and many others. This area makes up what is known as the 'Fort' area of Mumbai. It is so named after a fort which is no longer there.

During our drive around the city we saw many aspects of daily life. We saw some slum areas which are fairly sophisticated (albeit totally illegal) with links to mains electricity (also illegal). Most of them are two-storey affairs constructed out of anything that is going including corrugated iron, plastic, wood, stone and anything else that does the job. Miss Unknown explained that usually the top or bottom half is 'let out' while the 'owner' lived in the other part. There is, of course, no mains sewerage or water supply.

We also saw the Dabba Wallahs (food men) carrying and distributing tiffin boxes to Mumbai's working population.
Birds of Prey over Towers of Silence
Miss U explained that religious dietary laws mean that many Indian's prefer to eat food prepared at home according to strict rules. Their lunches are made after the workers have left for work and sent in special canteens (or tiffin boxes) to the city by train and then have to be delivered. The Dabba Wallahs carry out the complicated business of distributing the correct tins to their rightful owners in a formidable feat of memory.

We returned to the hotel for a rest before venturing out to eat at a restaurant called Barat Exellence which had been recommended by Miss U. It was only 10 minutes walk from our hotel and the food was very good and authentic. We both agreed we had had a very interesting day in Mumbai.

The Gateway to India
MUMBAI (FORMERLY BOMBAY), INDIA. Monday 19 March, 2012.

Arrived at the port entrance about an hour late. Then had to negotiate the lock to get into the inner harbour and Indira Dock. This was quite interesting to watch and we had a good view from deck 8 forward. The tug boats were brilliant. We had two behind and one in front. They carefully pulled and pushed The Discovery until she was parallel with the side of the lock and then gently prodded and pulled her inside. Once the lock gates were closed we waited about half an hour for the lock level to be the same as the inner harbour. The gates were opened and Discovery proceded inside with yet more pushing and pulling from the little tug boats. We were already late, but negotiating this lock had made us even later. We were eventually in position in the Indira Docks nearly 2 hours after we were due to arrive. Luckily we were in no hurry to disembark as we knew that we had two more days here in Mumbai (with a guide and driver) that we had arranged before leaving the UK.

Mumbai is known as the Gateway

to India and we had seen the physical 'Gate' on the way into Mumbai Harbour. Mumbai is a crystalisation of the diversity of India - with all its languages, standards of living, food, clothing, religions and races all in microcosm. It is supposed to be one of the best introductions to this vast subcontinent of 1.08 billion inhabitants - a sixth of the world's population.

Mumbai is home to 15 million of these people. Hindi is the national language in India, but English serves as the common tongue, surmounting scores of other languages and dialects - lucky for us! Mumbai is India's major harbour and one of the biggest ports in the world. The city occupies a tongue of land (once 7 separate islands) sticking out into the Arabian Sea. This means that real estate is very expensive as, being on a peninsula, it can only expand in one direction. Mumbai is the home to India's stock exchange and boasts many industries including textiles, petrochemicals, banking, machinery and movies. Mumbai is the film capital of India, outstripping even Hollywood!

The other reason that we weren't in any hurry to go ashore was that M had caught the Discovery
Palm Court
A good place to sit and watch the ocean go by, read or log on to the Wi Fi
lurgy. She had been poorly last night at dinner but now the sore throat, cough and cold had really taken hold. She was also running a fever. We stayed on board, had lunch and waited until everyone else had disembarked. We then got off and went to look for our hotel which was close to the Docks. All the dock gates have a colour, Grey, Yellow and Blue being the others that we saw - although there are more. We caught the shuttle to the Green Gate and easily found the hotel which was only 5 minutes walk away. We introduced ourselves and picked up a free map before returning to Discovery. It was hot and D was now also feeling under the weather.

We had a cup of tea and rested until dinner. We didn't make the farewell show as neither of us were too well. Dinner was nice and we were able to say our goodbyes to Marcia, John, Irene and Dave (Annette and Darryl had disembarked at Goa in order to do the ship's tour to Agra). M exchanged emails with Quo Vardis (our tour company) and agreed that we would disembark around 11 am the
The Discovery Lounge
next morning and that we would be met on the quay by one of their agents.

As there is nothing much to look at we will include a few pictures of the ship with this blog.

Before I start, I just have to say, Mom, Dad, and Family..... I bet you're missing me like crazy! Well, you should know I miss you guys too.

Anyways, I believe its safe to say that the team has lost all hope of returning sane. Monday was one of the craziest days yet, from breaking a sweat in the onion fields in the (very) early morning to the witty German humour of Frank at dinner. However, while we may not return with our sanity in tact, I think we will all return very happy and with a new outlook on life. God has asnwered both your prayers and ours as we keep on trecking through these two weeks, so here's a taste of some of the things that happened to us at the start of our second week here.

The morning started out with a lot of bending over and sitting in the morning sun picking onions in the fields near the back of the school. As usual, Errol brought our Chai tea for working SO hard, and let me tell you, there is nothing better than stopping for a break during work for Chai tea. The highlight of the morning, though, was when Mike pointed out some strange figure out in the far fields. At first we all thought it was a wandering human being. This was not the case. As they came closer, we begin to distinguish very long tails held high in the air, and noticed the creatures strange galloping run. At this point, some of the team had begun to devise an escape plan to get away from the monkeys, for that's what they were; very large, and a little nerve-wracking to say the least! (my parents will laugh when I mention the giant ""jack rabbit"" dream I once had where strange creatures came and carried me away). Thankfully, the monkeys never came very close, but we still went inside for breakfast just to be safe.

Breakfast and devotions went as usual, then with a hop skip and a drive we were in the heart of Nagpur, searching for the supplies to buy that many of you donated so graciously. This was another of todays great blessings! Not only did we find a great sports store, but we managed to get so much sports equipment for the schools that Bapu said they didnt need anything else! From there on it was chaos on the roads. I'm sure Mike has mentioned the traffic patterns in India, or the lack thereof, but it gets even worse when there are 12 white people standing on the side of the road! One street got so blocked with people watching us that no one could get by. So much for a low profile.

After stopping around town in a few shops, we ate at a great resturant called ""Hot Spot"". The place was adequatley named too, at least in my opinion. The food was delcious, but it defientley cleared up the sinuses! When everyone had filled themselves to the point of bursting, we left for the school. Unfortunately, we didn't make it back in time for our scheduled English classes, but we did still get to help with the music lessons. One thing that we will never be able to relay to you is the pure passion for Christ these kids have, especially in worship. Many were shouting the words to the songs, even if they didn't know them. As we say ""music is the universal language"". You don't need to understand the words to worship Him.

Soon, it was time for games with kids. Card games, field games, simple games, hard games you name it. It was overwhelming, the sheer mass of faces that wanted to play so badly. Overwhelming, but astounding at the same time. There are things you can never forget, and this was one of those moments. Still, the limitations of the human body can only go so far, and soon it was time for us to take a break. While the kids went to go do their homework, much of the team went to their rooms, cranked the fans, and just did nothing. This was another of those rare life moments.

Before dinner, the team got together around the baptism tank and sang all kinds of songs. Worship songs, camp songs, modern secular pop songs turned into worship songs... (by now many of us were laughing hysterically at nothing). Yet I must say that it was very obvious that the team was bonding. We harmonized to a few songs, and I would even go so far as to say that we sounded like professionals! Acting like professionals... well now that was a different thing entirely, but we're working on it.

The last event of the night was dinner. Fried chicken and rice has never tasted so good. By the end of it, all of our tummies were full and our cheeks hurt from laughter. Frank's house is truly the place to be at the end of the day. He is very very funny, along with the other teenage volunuteer from Germany Josh, but one thing I've learned on this trip its to watch out for those Germans! They are very witty, and our (and by our I mean my) gullability is a very entertaining thing for them. Still, we were all so giddy at this point that everyone laughed. Finally, our long day was done, and while some went to bed, a few of the young blood's stayed up and worked out in the weight room and explored the campus. Soren, Josh, and I all slept on top of the dorms outside with some of the older boys, and it was great to fall asleep under the twinkling lights of heaven.

Its been a long trip, and there is still much more to be done and stories to tell, but I'll leave that for another time. Your prayers are being heard by Him as always, and are appreciated so greatly by us. So for now, this is Connor Harrison, signing off from India!

Day 6: A Day of Rest

After a busy, fun-filled week mixed with travels, new experiences, and everything else we finally had some down time this Sunday. Our day started at 6:45am. The school hosts a Sunday School for the 650 boys in the dining hall and so after waking up we were wisked away to participate. You could hear the drums and singing from the guest house (which is on the polar other side of the dining hall) of all the kids worshipping in unison. We were welcomed in to the meeting again by their clapping and smiles. All of the kids sitting on the ground listening and watching Pastor Dilip (double Dilip) lead them in prayers and song. We were able to sing ""My God is So Big"" again. The kids are catching on quickly and love to sing it fast! I (Mike) spoke at Sunday School. It's really hard to speak to the students about something they live with more joy, excitement, and eagerness then I could ever know. I understanding more fully now how Paul felt when we started his letters to the Corinthians, "" 4 I always thank my God for you because
Photo 3
of his grace given you in Christ Jesus. 5 For in him you have been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge— 6 God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you. 7 Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. 8 He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 9 God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.""

These students lack nothing in faith. What a privilege it is to stand before them and tell them how richly blessed they are and how fortunate we are that we can be with them.

Not long after Sunday School we had breakfast and then church. Our team was asked to sing a song for the congregation of 100 men and women from the surrounding villages. We sang, ""I Love You Lord"" accapella. The ladies of the village shared a song with us as well. Church here is a very
Photo 4
refreshing reminder that the Spirit of God flows heavy in places where He is called upon.

As the day moved ahead we had full intentions of hanging out with the students for most hours but we found ourselves plagued with a heavy 45 degree heat. You know it's hot when the locals are wearing head coverings. However, (Ross you would be proud), we had the chance to learn and play cricket. Pam and I toughed out the heat and took the students on in a friendly game. Side note: these kids think I'm some kind of body builder (its great for the ego) and so they chose me to be first hitter in the game. I was very encouraged when they told me I hit 14 points only to learn afterwards that 14 points was patheticly low in cricket. They didnt let me bat again. Pam on the other hand kept launching it over the compound wall...she was aloud to keep hitting. The rest of the day was filled with rest, naps, and card games with the kids.

When the later afternoon rolled around we as a team were able to watch as the school brought in a
Photo 5
special cook to put together a special meal for the kids. The meal is chicken biryani. A traditional Indian dish that the kids only get once every few years. We watched a man combine all these spices and vegetables into these massive pots over fires in the courtyard. When it came time to eat, the kids were so excited, and they kept coming up and thanking us for the meal. We were able to eat with the kids in the dining hall tonight. They were so appreciative for the meal that one student asked to pray for Anne's meal and another two asked to sing a Marahti song to Amy. Unbelieveable.

Not long after an amazing meal we were all exhausted. The team is currently climbing the schools water tower and watching fireworks with some of the older boys. The 'older team members' are relaxing in the courtyard listening to a student play guitar and sing Marahti worship just outside our guest house. I've had a taste of the Promise Land - milk and honey come in a variety of forms.

That's day 6 - the day of much needed rest. Tomorrow we venture into the city again

to purchase items for the school, Monday will be busy day.

The Lake
Day 5: Brought to you by Siena and Tessa

Fifth day and we're still going strong! We woke up early on Saturday, and got right to work; as the kids do chores every morning, today we had the previlige to help them. We distributed sand over the playground and when got there, the boys were already hard at work. Now that may seem simple enough, however, here in India they do not use your typical Canadian shovel. We used large pan like bowls (with very sharp edges) to move the fresh sand over the playground. We stood in long lines, practically throwing the pans to each other just to save time. Unfortunately, the sharp edges wreaked some havoc on our forearms and minor injures insued. Amy is a great first aid administrator. The band-aids, in bright colours, did nothing to keep us under the radar.

After a healthy breakfast with lots of fresh fruit and devo's, we were lead on a nature walk, by our new friend Josh (from Germany), to a nearby lake. On this cultural walk, we saw water buffalo having a good bath in the lake, which compelled many of us to start singing the water
The Lake
buffalo song from veggie tales. This great view of Nagpur's main water source, called Gorewada Lake, was astonishing. Joshua informed us that just last Wednesday, 3 boys from the village died swimming in the lake because of the strong undertow. The locals use the water source as a swimming hole but Joshua said that hardly any of them know how to swim - very sad.

We wanted to see more, but we had to rush back to help prepare for a Teachers' Appreciation service. That consisted of us putting together snacks and sharing what it was like to be a teacher in Canada. The teachers from the school were able to ask many question about our school system in Canada and although the students had snuck out to play with the kids, we heard that they were eager to learn what they could and they had to tell them to stop asking question because time had ran out.

We had free time after, which we used wisely, playing hacky sack and spinning tops with the kids ... or at least trying to. After about an hour of playing, we couldn't take the heat any longer, and most of
Look, I caught a water buffalo!
us congregated in the one room on the property with air conditioning. Well crowded in a small room no bigger than a pineapple, we all tried to learn as much Hindi and Marathi as Errol could teach us in an hour...not much came out of it.

We were scheduled to play games with the kids after lunch in the large dining room so not knowing exactly what we were doing, we headed over anticipating a good time. We split up into groups and tryed to play simple card games with them such as Uno and Go fish, but some of us had to resort to the Hokey Pokey.

We got to give the kids to ice cream and it was awesome to serve them. It was fun but long, because it wasn't just a simple line up. The kids (all 653 of them) lined up in rows, with one icecream scooper to fill 660 cones ... you can imagine the suspense. It was worth the wait to see the kids light up when the rare treat was handed to them. Don't worry, only one ice cream cone was dropped.

It was a full day but there was
The River
still more. After dinner, we joined the kids for their movie night. We watched Home Alone, and the kids thought the slap-stick comedy was hilarious. After words we stumbled back to our rooms for a shower and sleep, but then the power went out - so, now shower tonight.

Please pray that the team continues to stay rested and strong. There are new relationships forming between the team members and locals - we ask you to pray that God continues to strengthen those relationships and His name may flourish in Nagpur.

Until next time,

Siena and Tessa

Day 3 Continued...



After music lessons where Pam taught the children ""Every Move I Make"", we were able to go out into the fields and teach the children some games. Anne did a fabulous job teaching the students duck duck goose, head and shoulders, and Pam lead them in a rousing chorus of Boom Chika Boom. It started to get dark out so we had to stop, but I'm sure we'll get a chance to do it again! Supper was at 8 pm and I'm pretty sure we all almost fell asleep in our plates. After travelling for 32 hours and staying up for who knows how many hours, sleep was much needed!

Day 4:

40 degrees… YUP, you heard that right… that was the temperature today. The kinda hot where you are sweating in places you didn’t even know could sweat; the kinda hot where you shower only to feel like you need to shower again by the time you change into new clothes; the kinda hot where you feel like a sweaty mess, but then look around at the locals to find they are in jeans and a long sleeved shirt and don’t even
Photo 3
look hot; the kinda hot where you can put on SPF 60 and still get a burn (or at least I do…).

But, it was a great day! We were so fortunate to be able to sleep in this morning, so the first thing on the schedule was breakfast and devos at 8am. Following breaky the team split into 2 groups, one going to computer class to lend a hand, and the other to the kitchen to help prepare lunch. I (Amy) was in the group that went to the kitchen. We joined 3 ladies that were sitting cross legged on the ground on potato sacks, cutting eggplant, potatoes and onion on pieces of wood as cutting boards. We tried to learn the ladies names, and after about the tenth time of repeating their names, they seemed to give up on our bad pronunciation. It was all going great… until the onions happened. I had tears streaming down my face, blood shot eyes and the ladies in the kitchen just laughed! I couldn’t believe they cut the onions no problem! The computer class supposedly went excellent with the team interacting with the students. Then we were taken for a
Photo 4
trip into town to get Western Style snacks. It was quite the adventure! Driven by Bapu and double Dillip (There are 3 men named Dillip, single Dillip, double Dillip, and triple Dillip), we got to see the city of Nagpur in full swing with all the shops and businesses open. The shop we went to was very large, filled with aisles of cookies, chips, pop, peanuts and all kinds of indian and western products. Errol introduced us to a local drink box (a yogurt type of drink) that was delicious! After that we were taken to a fruit stand where we got to sample some of the delicious fruit. Unfortunately mangos are not in season right now (India is known for it’s mangos), but we were able to buy papayas, oranges, grapes, pomegranate, kiwis, and sugar cane. I bought one large papaya, 2 small round brown fruit that I forgot the name of, one pomegranate, 2 oranges and 1 bag of sugar cane for $1.50. Unbelievable! Then came Tessa’s highlight of her day… she got to pet a camel! Our drivers so graciously stopped on the side of the road for us to be able to get a picture with
Photo 5
a camel and pet it if we so dared. It was very cool.

We arrived back at the school at 1:30 pm, half an hour past lunch time. We went straight to eat lunch at Frank’s house. I will just take this time to say that although Errol warned us that the food would not be that exquisite, it has far exceeded our expectations as well! Every meal we have chipates (not sure how to spell it - a type of flour tortilla), lentils in a sauce, rice and sometime curried vegetables. It is all so tasty! We are definitely not starving!

At 2:00 pm we helped in an English class which was very interesting, and then at 2:30 some of the team were helping in the kitchen again. By 3:30 pm we were all in the chapel to help with Music lessons where Pam taught the students ""Every Move I Make"". Anne and myself taught the students the chords on a keyboard while Mike and Soren helped the students with guitar. It was a blast teaching them! They seemed so eager to learn.

At 4:30 pm the women of the team had the amazing opportunity of
Photo 6
being apart of a women's service. All of the wives of the teachers at the school gather at someone's home to have a church service. As we walked up to the home they were singing ""How Great Thou Art"" in Marati. Just like everywhere we have been, we were treated like royalty. Anne shared a short message with the ladies, we sang a couple songs for them, and they sang a couple songs for us. But I think the highlight of the whole experience was at the end when we sang ""How Great Thou Art"" together, them in Marati and us in English. It is truly amazing how music really is a universal language! It was incredible to be able to praise God with these women!

At 7:30 pm we lead all 650 students in a chapel service. When we entered the eating area (where they do chapel since the chapel is not big enough for all the students) they all started clapping to welcome us. They then taught the actions to one of their songs. The energy was incredible. They loved seeing us do the actions to their song! Mike spoke, the team did their ""David and Goliath""
Photo 7
drama, and we taught all the students 2 songs, ""Every Move I Make"" and ""My God is so Big"". I have to say that I think the highlight was when Soren came out as the giant on Connor's shoulders. The dramatic facial expressions of Soren had all the children in fits laughing. It was a fabulous performance of the Bible story, although the giant fell over dead BEFORE the pebble was shot... very hilarious. I got it all on video, I'm sure you'll be able to see it when we get back. We had so much fun teaching the children ""Our God is So Big"". Some of the team (aka Soren) is getting quite the fan base and they just loved watching us doing the actions.

A very packed day with little down time, but it was such an incredible one! Please continue to pray for safety and health. With the heat, a couple have had a bit of mild heat stroke, so please pray that we will find ways to deal with the heat. We are having the time of our life seeing God working in this place and being ministered to by these amazing children.

From the Airport to the School.
*i just need to point out that we would love to post pictures but the Internet at the school is legging a little and getting posts up seems to be the best we can do at this time...but bare with us!



Day 3: safe arrival in Nagpur



Passports all accounted for? Check. Nobody sick yet? Check. Everyone asleep from Seoul to Mumbai - absolutely! Mumbai was a whirlwind in the early hours of the morning. One would think that an airport would be slow and quiet at 2:45am...not in Mumbai. Everything was on time and we had to take a short commuter bus from the international terminal to the domestic gates to catch our flight to Nagpur. I'd like to think that everyone was simply being nice but I think that the fact that we had 2 blonde females and pale faces had something to do with us being moved to the front of every line. Immigration was a breeze and we were waved through customs. All the luggage was accounted for and there in the distance we saw an all to familiar face - Errol! It was like seeing a brown oasis! Finally someone
The team on the bus.
who spoke the language, knew the area, and who was willing to lead and guide us to the school. The domestic flight was a breeze and a short 1.5 hours skip over to Nagpur. And this is where things got crazy.

We were warmly welcomed by a plethora of students, directors, and drivers who scooped up all our luggage and piled us onto the school, Prem Sewa, bus. Bapu, the school director, Frank, the school founder, and a series of young energetic school boys made the short 40 minute drive to the school entertaining to say the least. It was as if we were long-lost relatives. Smiliing, hugging, and warm welcomes made this a great 'start' to our stay in Nagpur.

Now, let's discuss the traffic patterns in Nagour for a moment. Simply put - there is none. Your strongest asset while driving is your horn and from what I understand the louder the horn, the bigger the vehicle, and more unlikely to stop for anything! Including dogs, cats, cows, bulls, women, children, scooters and weddings - yes weddings! None of this will make total sense without pictures but we drove right through a wedding - in a
Our welcoming
school bus. Needlessto say we took many pictures on our way to the school - mostly for insurance reasons.

And then the bus turned in to the school. 'Welcome to Prem Sewa' - the school modo, 'do something, lead, follow, or get out of the way!' what an entrance but it didn't stop there. We all got off the bus to what seems to be parked a good city block away from the actual school. When starting the walk we rounded the corner only to find all 700 boys lined up on either side singing, banging drums, smiling, and throwing confetti all to our arrival. These kids have absolutely nothing and yet they celebrate our arrival? In looking back at the team, it was enough to bring anyone to tears. They didn't even know who we were and they were throwing a party.

Let me take a moment here to reflect on something; arguablely India is one of the spiritually darkest countries in the world. The poverty, famine, drought, religious superiority, and persecutions makes this country suppressive to say the least. BUT the spirit of God is heavy in Prem Sewa. It is thick, tangible, and practical. It
The Team at the guest house
moves in these kids and teachers in obvious ways - and we've only been here for a few hours. Prem Sewa feels like home!

With handmade flower lays around each of our necks we found our way to the guest house which far surpassed our expectations (I.e. western toilets and spectacular bedrooms). We then settled in for breakfast (we think cause we each have lost all sense of time). Shortly afterwards we were able to get a tour of the school grounds led by a very witty Frank. The German humor and warm heartedness made us feel right at home. We met some students, Soren exercised his ESL/comedy skills to a grade 7 English class and we were constantly followed by a herd of puppies - not the ones you want take home!

And so here we are now. 3:17pm, just had lunch, and are resting waiting for some hangout time with the students. Each of us are starting to feel the reality of long travel and lack of sleep but none would deny that we are eager to get our hands dirty and get whooped at cricket!



Please pray for a great night sleep
Wondering to our chalets.
tonight for the team, and a boldness to step out faith and make Jesus known to the school. Kids, teachers, and each other.



Until next time,



A very tired but excited India Team.

I thought I’d elaborate on the first post when I mentioned ‘God presented us with our first challenge’. The connecting flight was a breeze, we had everyone together despite how busy and bustling the airport was. WE even got to experience the underground commuter train between terminals. Incheon airport in Seoul is a beautiful, modern airport. The connecting flight was quite the walk but we had ample time to get there (approx. 3 hours). We stood in line for another security check so we could get to our next gate. After getting just near the check one of our team members approached me and said, ‘do we have to go in right now?’ I was a little confused and asked why. ‘I can’t find my passport.’ I knew this was coming eventually but it came a little earlier then expected. (*I’ll keep the name of the person anonymous, you can inquire when we get home if you want).

So there you have it, just before our connecting flight and a missing passport already. Not sure how many people out there have experienced the Korean way of doing things (Amy and I lived there for a year, so we knew a little of how to communicate) but the Korean people have a super laid-back, no sense of urgency kind of attitude. Which is great in most circumstances but in our case – we felt a certain sense of urgency. It was such a long distance between the two gates and the number of people that would have travelled that area already made going back and finding it a little daunting – but I did. The challenge to the team was to sit, in the middle of the traffic, and pray. And that is exactly what they did. As I ran off with a few security guards to find the missing passport I looked back at the humbling image of our team sitting together praying. What an amazing sight.

It was now 7:30pm (Seoul time) and our flight would leave at 8:20pm. Time had simply disappeared along with the passport. I had searched with Korean officials for two hours for the passport while the team stayed back and prayed. But as I approached the team at the security check – they were giving me a ‘thumbs-up’ as I discouragingly walked back to them with nothing but bad news.

But in light of a frantic two-hour search, moments before I arrived a Korean official brought the passport over to the team before I got back. And so, through security we went with 15 minutes to spare, had a quick snack, and we were back on schedule to Mumbai – another 9.5 hour flight.



Please pray for rest for the team as we approach Mumbai;<a name=""_GoBack""></a> pray for excitement and anticipation! Nagpur, India – here we come!

Aurangabad to Mumbai


Mumbai Harbour Front
Mumbai
We left Aurangabad at 7am and it took seven hours to get to Mumbai not an overly interesting drive but I did see two guys and four goats on a motorcycle and what may have been a dead man on the roadside. The roads here are generally poor and incredibly dangerous, fortunately I have only been in one accident in the two months I have been here and that was a motorbike we hit the other day (not serious). We arrived at our hotel around mid afternoon farewelled our driver and checked into the hotel, I had arranged earlier in the week.

Mumbai is a pleasant surprise at least the area where we are staying, it ranks with Udaipur in the pleasant city stakes, and I particularly like the rotting British architecture that surrounds us. We visited the UNESCO World Heritage listed Grand Central Station shortly after we arrived, a stunning building but frighteningly like a Chinese station inside with massive numbers of people pushing and shoving. Unfortunately the police are not letting people enter some of the other buildings in the complex due to the recent terror attacks. We did however visit the Central Post Office which is a
Mumbai traffic
Mumbai
beautifully domed building before wandering over towards the Mumbai University and checking out many a stunning colonial era building and just as many cricket matches.

The next morning we undertook the Mumbai walking tour down to the Gate of India and took a ferry to Elephanta Island very peaceful trip out there, but the World Heritage listed caves weren’t a patch on Ellora or Ajanta, still the first temple dedicated to Shiva was well worth a look. The path down to the harbour passes through a tunnel of souvenir shops and the prices and quality seemed reasonable so I made a few small purchases.

We then took ship back to the docks near the Gate of India and decided to go to the world famous and incredibly pretentious Tah Mahal Palace Hotel, I think we expected to walk in find a bar and have beer but unfortunately not being guests meant no drinks, so Padraic went and used the toilet and I waited in the lobby. It was lunch time so we went looking for Leopold’s a famous Mumbai landmark thinking we would have a quiet lunch and a beer, again that was over ambitious as the place
Victoria Terminus
Mumbai
is cashing in on the free advertising it gained from that very average Shantaram novel and has jammed in so many tables that you can’t move and are also charging ridiculous prices for food and beverages.

Just around the corner though is a great value pub called The Alps where they do excellent meals, have a TV and sell reasonable value beers so we watched the cricket for a few hours before taking a rambling route back to the hotel. That evening I visited an Italian restaurant where they sold, wait for it, Shepherd’s Pie I was so excited I ordered it straight away, when the waiter brought the meal to my table it looked like a real Shepherd’s Pie and I was ecstatic, when I started eating though and fiery chilli lacing the dish set my tongue on fire. Why do Indians have to add chilli to everything and in such copious amounts?

The next morning we headed to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya or the Prince of Wales Museum for short, today is the Holi Festival so Mumbai is like a ghost town and I am loving it, the Museum is the best I have
Inside the Victoria Terminus
Mumbai
seen in India and I enjoyed it immensely spending many hours wandering through the exhibits with my audio guide directing me, I have never used one before and regret not doing so in the past. It was then back down to that little pub from yesterday for a feed and a few beers. The pub soon started filling up with foreigners covered in paint who were doing their best to drink the place dry and they were succeeding as one type of beer after another was declared sold out. I had a mutton (goat) burger today before wandering back towards our hotel, lots of people sleeping in the sun and quite a few multicoloured dogs, obvious victims of Holi paint wars. I have enjoyed my time in Mumbai and would have no problems returning to this very pleasant city.

A view over the caves and valley
Ajanta Caves
On Saturday 3 March, we made an early start as we hoped to complete the hundred kilometre drive to the World Heritage listed Ajanta Caves before the tour buses and the crowds arrived and thankfully the car park was almost empty.

Although the crowds were thin on the ground we still had to force our way through the swarming touts, which went a little bit like this-

""Sir sir where are you from""

Silence

""Sir come this way"" through a maze of strategically laid out shops

One grabs my arm and I state calmly ""Will you back off I don’t want your stuff""

""Sir why are you so hostile and rude"" a tout yells

My response is ""What do you mean rude? It is rude to harass people before they have even exited their vehicle""

""Sir this is our business""

""Yes and this is my holiday now piss off""

This is the same story all over India and it is wearing thin, from here we face another scam the forced paid bus ride to the caves, with more touts on the bus with a captive audience all bawling their lies.
Panoramic of the Ajanta complex
Ajanta Caves
When we arrive there are more touts swarming us as we get off the bus, I ignore them and head for the ticket office where we pay twenty five times the entrance fee of the Indian native who is trying to force his way in front of me, he will later show his immense respect for his heritage by urinating outside one of the caves.

The caves aren’t as spectacularly carved as those at Ellora but they are much older and have wonderfully painted interiors, these caves were long forgotten until discovered completely by accident in 1819 by a British hunting party and have become internationally famous for their magnificent fresco paintings which Japanese donors have attempted to preserve by installing technology to protect them and security guards patrol the more important caves, otherwise they would smell like piss as well. This is India.

Buddhist worshippers perhaps from Korea exit one of the more impressive caves having left donations behind; the security guards immediately push and shove each other in their haste to pocket these notes.

On leaving the caves the touts pursue the Buddhist worshippers on to the bus, by now I have little remaining patience
Cave One - Mahayana Buddhist monastery
Ajanta Caves
and I demand they leave the bus, as the driver will not depart until they have harassed all the occupants, the first leaves while the second becomes aggressive and a violent argument ensues between us before he also leaves.

As the bus takes, off a woman lectures me on my lack of patient, “this is their culture” she says, and Padraic bursts out laughing. After exiting the bus I visit a stall to get my Nan a present, what a mistake that was, the shop owners surge forth, sticking several of their wares in my face, I literally run back to our car, they chase me, the onslaught is so intense that I require assistance to get my door shut.

Padraic had to get out and shoulder one of them out of the way so I could close the door. This tout still hadn’t given up and runs in the vehicles wake shouting ""wait wait three pieces for eight hundred rupees"". I take a deep breath and try to relax.

India is THE worst place in the world for aggressive touts even surpassing Egypt.

Yesterday was approximately my 44th day since arriving in India and was
Cave Two
Ajanta Caves
also my 44th birthday I cant say it was much of a birthday being so far away from my loved ones but at least I was able to complete a work out, get truly clean and eat some beef (probably buffalo) for the first time in about six weeks.

Even with Padraic's company it wasn’t the most pleasant of days. We checked out of our previous hotel at 9am moved our luggage to the Lemon Tree Resort which was a miracle in itself as it was a nightmare to get into the place, it took one visit, two emails and two phone calls just to make a reservation, and depending on who I spoke to the place was full or not. This is India.

It was then time to visit some of the local sites in and around Aurangabad beginning with the Bibi-Ka-Maqbara a mausoleum built by the son of Aurangzeb in honour of his mother, apparently he planned to build another Taj but the emperor refused to spend the money, so instead of being finished in marble it was done in lime mortar instead and became known as the Poor man’s Taj. Still the building, despite its
Cave Four
Ajanta Caves
lack of maintenance and the old rusted scaffolding clinging to its sides was well worth a look.

From here we visited Aurangabad's cave temples, not a patch on Ellora or Ajanta but still interesting and more importantly deserted so we had the ten caves spread over two sites to ourselves. These caves were built around the time Ellora was commencing and are all Buddhist; there were also some nice views of 'the poor man's Taj' from the hilltop. There were five people here one was working while four sat in the shade watching, the one that was working asked us for money as he claimed it was hard work. This is India.

From here it was onto Daulatabad the 12th century ruined hilltop fortress, the first thing you see on approach is that the mountain has been sheared off on all sides and looks like a huge square of Cadbury chocolate with some ruins on top. As usual at these places we were pounced upon by touts as we climbed from the vehicle, they just do not understand the word NO even though they understand everything else you say. Eventually they fell away and we entered the city.
Cave Four
Ajanta Caves
In 1328 the Delhi Sultan Tughluq decided he would march his capital eleven hundred kilometres from Delhi to Daulatabad only to realise there wasn’t enough water to sustain the city so he marched them all back again. Only in India.

It was stinking hot at this site so we decided not to climb to the top, but we visited the temples checked out the beautifully cast canon (six different metals were used) on the tower and crossed the moat before entering a tunnel to visit the Chini Mahal where a Hydrabadi king was held captive for twelve years until his death. Then the usual annoyance began, kids started swarming me, idiots started trying to photograph me and my memory card in my camera was full so, I left followed by a flock of idiots till I reached the sanctuary of the car. It was then back to our new hotel for some lunch before enjoying the rest of my birthday, lazing, eating and drinking.

Waiting at the station
Mumbai to Kerala (4th to 10th March)




Carla: Glad to say that my inclination just to slope around at the Manoribel was scuppered by Al who was keen to at least leave the place for a short while on our weekend there. So on Sunday we visited a nearby landmark (literally as you can see the thing for miles in the landscape) called the Global or Vipassana Pagoda. It’s a Burmese Buddhist temple built to encourage world peace and harmony through a meditation style known as Vipassana. Apparently if you practice this art you can achieve peace and freedom from anger, depression and all mental ailments. You have to start by doing a ten-day residential course, the first nine days of which you are to remain silent. So, despite the free board and lodging included, that rather precluded us. There were evidently enough people who had done the course, however, as the world’s largest unsupported stone dome in the central building of the temple complex had a good 80 or 90 people meditating in it when we visited. And you’re only allowed to do that if you’ve completed the course.

On Monday morning we set off early
Station platform at Mumbai
with the help of the brilliant owner of the Manoribel who sorted our transport all the way to Panvel Station on the other side of Mumbai (and then some) and organised an early breakfast for us. We took a very long cab ride from the ferry landing stage to Panvel, seeing more of the highs and lows of Mumbai along the way. Sitting in an air-conditioned cab doesn’t help with the feeling of detachment from the reality of the city but nonetheless you can’t help but be affected by seeing people living life in corrugated constructions by roads, rivers and railway tracks. Some of them have two stories and satellite dishes but still dusty curtains for doors, clearly no security or privacy and not much sanitation. The general state of the roadsides and pavements doesn’t help the impression of the city and the lack of any obvious litter-clearing provision. There were posters up saying “Keep our city clean and green” but if the authorities don’t provide bins, bin-men or street sweepers then what hope is there? Intermingled with all this there is obvious modernity, middle-class ambition and the evidence that Mumbai is the financial and business capital of India. Get
On the train
your smartphone out and let’s do business, just excuse me whilst I step over this cow poo in the open sewer.

From Mumbai we boarded the Kerala train to find we’d been down-graded due to faulty carriages from 2-tier AC to 3-tier AC (made us feel right at home, like we were travelling on Southern Railways back in the UK!). It all turned out OK in the end with us managing to secure six bunks for the four of us in one section of the compartment. The toilets were predictably grim but having been forewarned by a very well-travelled Mumbai lady on the plane from London we were armed with tissues, hand sanitizer and a sense of humour. The journey was uneventful apart from having to share the overnight portion with a rather deaf old gentleman, his wife and their similarly doddery friends. They arrived after all the carriage had retired to bed and proceeded to loudly try to find their berths, putting lights on and repeating themselves endlessly for the benefit of their deaf companion. In the morning they turned the lights back on at 6.30am to perform their ablutions and get dressed which meant, I assumed, that
View from our house in Karala
they were to disembark at the next stop. But no, they were going to the end of the line, just as we were, which wouldn’t be reached until 3pm that day. All slightly annoying, but part of the joy of communal overnight train travel.

Arriving at Kochuveli Station, we were met by Binu our host at the Lotus Jewel Beach House. The house is a little further south than Kovalam Beach on the Poovar Road, in the heart of proper religious Kerala. Christians, Muslims and Hindus all live side-by-side along this bit of the coast, not without conflict apparently. The Hindus were dominating the scene when we arrived as March is Temple Festival Month. This would be a charming event (and probably was in pre-amplifier days) but now it seems to mainly consist of speakers blaring out devotional chat, religious and some, quite definitely not religious, music. This starts at 5am and goes on pretty much to 1am without interruption. However, the house is beautiful, fully-eco, right on the beach and staffed with lovely people who can’t do too much for us. Mustn’t grumble, as they say.



On Thursday we went to visit my friend
At abisheks school
Sheela and took a stroll to collect her son Abhishek from his school not far down the road from her house. Her eldest son Alex was also there on a short holiday from his school in Trivandrum. He suffers from cerebral palsy and learning difficulties due to problems when he was born. He was sweet and charming when we were there but apparently can be difficult and sometimes violent when his frustration overwhelms him. Abhishek was taking an exam in English Grammar that morning but had special permission to leave school to have lunch with us. Sadly we weren’t allowed inside his school as the strict headmistress (a Catholic Mother Superior) was worried we would disrupt the lessons. Sheela said she is a bit of an old bat (not her words) who shows little flexibility in anything – still she probably gets good results! Abhishek goes to a Catholic primary school (they call it first to fourth standing in India) although he and his family are Anglicans and go to the Church of South India church. We were served a delicious lunch by Sheela, her sister and brother-in-law. Sheela shares her house with her mother-in-law and unmarried sister-in-law. Her
At sheela's house with her brother in law
sister and husband were visiting in our honour from the family home in Kaliakkavilai in Tamil Nadu. Whilst we ate lunch the children watched Indian Cartoon Network and George and Abhishek played a Ben10 board game. Monoculture here we come!

Alex: On our final night at Manori Beach we had dinner (with my now customary huge bottle of Kingfisher lager) and went to bed early as we had to be up next morning to catch the ferry. Travelling to the ferry with all four of us and all our bags in a little auto-rickshaw was a bit of a squash but it was just a short journey. They were ready to leave when we got to the ferry dock and we had to run laden with our luggage whilst the captain beeped his horn. We made it and then he stopped beeping and waited a few more minutes. I think he was having a laugh. The train to Kerala was huge and it is well catered. We were offered chai (which was so sweet that George ordered a cup and then drank the remains of Carla’s who couldn’t drink it because it was so sweet), pakora, crisps, strawberries
A big temple elephant
(which we had some) and omelette and we didn’t have to leave our seats. The arguments over who got the top bunk were finally peacefully resolved – George top, Ruby middle, Carla and me on lower bunks. The journey was to take about 30 hours. Thank goodness we had an electrical point to recharge the iPods!

In Kerala, by Friday, after four days of temple festival music belting out from the speakers strung up all round the village morning, noon and night we were all feeling a little exhausted. Sometimes the music went on until 1am and started up again at 5! The music was part of the 8 deities festival which had its culmination in a parade led by an elephant between the three temples in the village. We thought we’d best see what all the fuss was about. We were led through the back of the village by Binu, the ‘fixer’ for people staying at the house, to the men’s temple, and there was the elephant, standing about 10 feet tall, being given a bath and then fed. We watched and took photos of the elephant, and then watched the first stage of the festival – involving
GnR and a big temple elephant
lots of drumming – take place in the temple. I was invited in, but Carla was not allowed as grown women are forbidden in this temple.



Ruby joined me going into the temple, but we immediately had to leave as it was too loud for her, and it seemed impolite her standing there with her fingers in her ears. We followed the elephant for a while as it walked towards the next temple, along with a small crowd of locals and a couple of other tourists. We had a short break to buy supplies and then returned later to watch the parade. First out was the elephant (which we just missed by a minute), followed by trucks with animatronic lions, leopards and humans, including the demon king with 10 heads. There were boys with elaborately painted faces and peacock feather headdresses, men with what looked like huge colourful decorated flowering plants on their shoulders spinning around and around, and lots more drumming. It was all over in about 15 minutes, with a short delay as one of the trucks got caught in the telephone wires overhead. It caused a big traffic jam and that would very likely
Following the elephant
continue for some time as the elephant slowly walked up the road, followed by the trucks and the crowd. It was very loud and very colourful, and I’m sure we’ll all remember it for a long, long time.

Ruby: 3rd March: It was just a lazy day today so we decided we were going to go to the beach again. We splashed around a lot this time. It was much colder. We got dry in a towel and got a drink. I ordered apple juice, I didn’t like it but my Mum and Dad forced me to drink it. I asked to have a sip of George’s coke. He said “Yes” so I had a sip and found I liked it. We went home and had showers. Then we went to lunch and ordered noodles and they were lovely. Then we went back to the beach AGAIN!! 4th March: Today we got into a three-wheeled taxi with no doors. We were going to the Global Pagoda. When we got there I was wishing that it was our house because it was golden and red and those are two of my favourite colours. We went inside and we
The festival parade
had to take our shoes off and had to be very quiet, in fact silent. 5th March: Today we left the hotel and we got on the sleeping train to Kerala. I liked it in the train. We had an argument. I wanted to go to the top bunk on my own but my mum said I had to go with her. 6th March: When we arrived it was boiling. We waited for someone called Binu to take us to a house that we were staying at. I liked Kerala. Then Binu arrived we got into the car, me and George sat in the boot of the car with all the bags. We had a look around the house George said it was royal, it was 8 o’clock at night my bedtime, so we went to bed. I couldn’t get to sleep because the whole town was having a festival. 7th March: Today my Dad promised we would go to the beach. The beach is our garden so we went to the beach. 8th March: My mum knows someone in India, she is called Sheela. We went to see her son’s school. It looked really good and nice then we
The 10 headed demon
went home to Sheela’s house and had lunch. 10th March: Yesterday there was a festival. We saw an elephant. It was noisy so I slept in my mum’s room. This morning George found a mouse in his room.

George: 3rd March: I accidently sleep until 9 o’clock so Dad has to wake me up. We have breakfast and then we go back to the apartment to get our swimming kits. We go back to the sea but this time Mum comes. We come back from the beach and take a shower then we go down to the restaurant area. Me and Ruby have veggie pizza because Dad says that we could get sick if have meat from India. Oops, it turns out we can’t have veg pizza because it’s on the snack menu and they are not serving snacks at lunchtime. So we have noodles instead. 4th March: Today is our last day in the Manoribel Hotel. We go to the beach and meet a person called Talib. Then we go to the Global Pagoda temple. It is the largest stone dome in the world! After I have written in my diary and in my ‘Diary of a
The Mouse That Roared!
Wimpy Kid Do-it-yourself’ book we go down to the restaurant for tea. 5th March: We go to Platform 7 of Panvel Station and board a train to Kerala. We will be on the train overnight because it is a super long journey. 6th March: We get off the train at Kochuveli. It is very desert-like. The hotel manager’s assistant (sic) Binu picks us up and takes us to a house right by the beach. We go down to Kovalam, a town near us and have dinner at the Swiss Café. I have calamari with chips, yum! 10th March: This morning I wake up and there is a mouse in my bed. Dad gets woken up by me and he tries to get rid of it. We go down to Binu’s tailor shop and we get long trousers for me and mummy and a skirt for Ruby. We have fish and rice for lunch, yum! I forgot to mention, yesterday there was an elephant going around the village and it was all dressed up for the festival and people were taming him. And the day before we went to my mum’s pen pal’s house.. We went to her son’s school.
Manoribel Restaurant
The school was tall and brown and it was still not finished. It felt weird to see other kids working at school but I wasn’t.

Mumbai
By Polona

A day after Jan's birthday it was time to leave Goa. Honestly, if it were up to the two of us we could easily persuade each other to stay there till the end of the trip. Not that it was that awesome, it was just that simple. But I am not sure how fun that would have been for Brane. 😊

So after seeing Old Goa we were waiting for the night bus to take us all to Mumbai. This was our first overnight bus in India...and I swear the last one as well (he, he...I can swear now, that we already have tickets for an overnight train to Delhi, which is our last long journey on this trip, so HA!).

Looking forward to catching some sleep on the cosy double bed that was waiting for us on the bus, I soon realised falling asleep would prove to be anything but easy.

To say the road was bumpy, would be a severe understatement. I was being thrown up and down and half the time I was trying not to fall on top of Jan and crush his tiny body underneath mine 😊. Brane said that
Mumbai washing area
mastering the art of not falling of your bed was even harder doing from his upper bunk bed. So it would be very difficult to say that we got any sleep at all. Well, we did when the road turned less bumpy, but that was also the time we arrived to Mumbai, where we got thrown off the bus in the middle of nowhere, classic.

Brane found a backpackers' hostel online the day before, in one of Mumbai's area, Kolaba. It was ran by the Salvation Army (which was, I am sure you didn't see this one coming, the name of the place as well) and was far from being anything special, but t was cheap and full of backpackers. We were even separated in boys and girls only dormitories.😊

The hotel staff were a bit weird as well, every time anyone passed by the reception, they would yell at you, whether you paid for the night yet. Which happened to you at least 5 times a day. You would also be rushed out of the cafeteria/ lounge area immediately after breakfast, so you could only hang out there later in the afternoon. But, as I said, it
Brane style!
was cheap for Mumbai, so we stayed. Not to be totally crappy about it all...there was this friendly older gentleman working at the downstairs reception, who was always ready to help, whether with instructions on how to find your way around or...well, Brane somehow managed to lose the key to his lock, which he used to lock his locker. And had all his valuables in. We went to ask this guy for help and he didn't even blink, he appeared seconds later with a saw – didn't work, he came back with a hammer and smashed open the lock. Needles to say, stuff like that apparently happens a lot at the hostel. But, we bought Brane a brand new combination lock soon after. 😊

As Brane fell asleep just at the moment Jan woke up (the boys needed their beauty sleep), and Jan and I were both hungry we went to find a place to eat. We walked randomly and passed a restaurant on the main street that looked quite full, but we decided to look further. But after we turned around the corner , we saw the name of the restaurant was LEOPOLD'S!!! Anyone who has read Shantaram
The slum
will know what I am talking about and as we both read the book on this trip, we turned around and went in, OF COURSE!

I was slightly disappointed though, it looked like a nice place. I mean come on, where are the old geezers drowning there sorrows in alcohol, the swanky mobsters and the weird looking prostitutes? I mean THAT sounds like a cool place. Ah well, maybe the prices were all that was criminal 😊, at least Jan said the beer was absurdly too expensive.

The next day in the spirit of being active, we went to the Gates of India (just another huge monument – well, frankly, I am too lazy to look it up again, but I will tell you this: it looked nice and old) and boarded a boat to take us to the Elephanta island, where there are several underground temples still preserved, dedicated to god Shiva.

We arrived there on a Sunday, so the place was really busy. I thought you kind of almost crash into the temples with the boat, but man you have to do your portion of walking and climbing steep stairs before getting there.

The
Gate of India
temples were quite an interesting sight, but I guess if you ask the boys the monkeys were far more interesting. I was scared of the little rascals though, as I saw them “barking” and “growling” at people carrying shiny stuff (mostly water bottles), and guess who was carrying ours? Yup, yours truly. So, I was trying to discourage Jan and Brane from taking another thousand photos of the animals, but no luck. It even encouraged Brane to tell me, that a lot of times, these monkeys would have rabies. Really? Thanks! I was hoping that if they did feel like biting, they would be more into tiny, male butts, instead of the likes of mine, you know, more voluptuous. 😊

As Brane forgot his hat at the hostel, we persuaded him into buying a really cool hat, with a bit of the old mob style to it, that got us into trouble later, as he checked himself in the mirror after returning to the hostel. Hihi, still funny and we are still making him to carry it with him, checking rooms, just in case he “forgot” it.

What else...oh, of course, Arsenal won against Liverpool that day as
Rescuing Brane
well, so all was well in the world.

The next day we wanted to see some more of Mumbai but weren't really up for walking in the scorching sun (the boys apparently have an irrational fear of the sun – they both have pale and delicate skin 😊) for the whole day. We hired one of the “city tour” taxis instead.

Our driver, Vijay, was a chatty man, luckily, as it made the whole trip a bit more fun and we talked about life in Mumbai. Our first stop was the “washing area” where people work night and day, washing hotels' linen, clothes...The area was huge, with concrete pools, each filled with clothes to be washed by numerous men working there. Then Vijay took us to see one of the slums close by and it was interesting to see, how they can be completely independent from the rest of the city. They have their own shops, barber shops, pharmacies...they are a city within a city. Apparently there are around 60.000 slums all over Mumbai.

Following that we went around a bit, to the Hanging gardens (small park), the old Victoria train station...It was a nice field trip
Monkeys
and it's amazing how Mumbai reminded me of the UK. I mean not the city city, but the architecture, left from the British colonial period.

Well, we said goodbye to Mumbai after 2 days and set for a 19 hour train journey to Pushkar, to celebrate holi and spend some money – shopping time!!! Wup, wup 😊. Oh, and Brane realised he forgot his e – reader at the hostel and is still mourning his loss. Luckily for him, we saved Shantaram (lucky for us really, that book weighs a friggin ton!!!).

March 2nd 2012
Published: March 2nd 2012
Total Distance: 389.75 miles / 627.24 km
Mouse: 0,0
Bidar to Ellora


A hole in a wall reveals the stunning Indra Sabha
Ellora Caves
I am feeling healthy today, still disappointed with the food but there is nothing new about that, when we departed Beed I had a bag of chips and a carton of mango juice to break my fast.

It took us perhaps three hours to drive to the fifty two thousand year old basalt crater at Lonar which was filled with a salty green lake with a circumference of 1.8 kilometres and a deciduous forest. A very impressive sight, there are sixteen temples built around the lake some of which were quite attractive. After checking out the crater we had an excellent lunch (eggs and chapatis for me) before visiting a couple of interesting old temples around the town.

From here we made the long drive to Aurangabad arriving in the late afternoon, I noticed a pizza bar along the airport road which was pleasing. After a pleasant if spicy dinner at the hotel’s restaurant I wandered across the road to get on the internet and to indulge in a couple of large bottles of beer before returning to my room to watch a bit of TV.

The next morning we travelled the thirty kilometres to the Ellora Caves
Meteor Crater
Lonar
these rock cut temples laboriously chipped out of a hillside over five centuries by Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monks were near the top of my list when I was planning the itinerary for this trip. The Kailasa Temple the world’s largest monolithic sculpture is unique and amongst the best that Indian architecture has to offer. I have seen rock cut caves in other Asian countries some of which were absolutely spectacular but Ellora is something else. When we arrived at this World Heritage site we paid the usually steep foreigners fee and followed the path leading to the complex, fortunately someone suggested we take the path to the left and head towards the Buddhists caves first, the first cave we visited was Cave Fourteen or the Ravana Ki Khai which is a Hindu cave dedicated to Shiva, it was a nice taste of what was to come.

The next cave of note was the Tin Thal (Cave Twelve) or the Three Story Cave a very impressive Buddhist cave with sleeping rooms on the ground floor, a meeting hall on the second and some wonderfully carved Buddha images on the third, this temple also had a large carved courtyard out
Mor Mahadeo Temple
Lonar
the front. The next (Cave Eleven) was Do Thal or the Two Story Cave this was also very impressive. Cave Ten or Viswakarma is a chaitya (prayer hall with a stupa) and has ribs carved into the ceiling which once held wooden panels. Cave Nine has some fantastic carvings including dwarfs and the goddess Tara. Cave Five also known as the Maharwada is the largest vihara (monastery) at the site and has twenty massive columns, twenty four cells and long raised platforms that may have been used for dining or perhaps as a class room. The other caves in the Buddhist group are also interesting many were living quarters, granaries, meditation and prayer halls.

We were quite lucky as we were able to see most of these caves in near solitude, as we walked back towards Cave Fifteen from Cave One we began encountering much larger groups of tourist, which disappointed me as I enjoyed the caves much more when crowds were sparse. Cave Fifteen or Das Avatara has a large courtyard is double storied and was built around the eighth century. This temple has sculptural panels on all the second story walls of mythological figures. Cave Sixteen is
Meteor Crater
Lonar
Kailashnath Temple the most incredible of structures, it is carved out of eighty five thousand cubic metres of rock; its entrance is fifty metres long and thirty three metres wide. The central structure is lined on all sides by carved elephants and two more full sized pachyderms’ stand in the courtyard, the second level of the pyramidal central temple still has traces of painted ceilings and fantastic views across the complex. This Temple is up there with the Taj Mahal and the Tiger as highlights of my trip, I was relieved that I didn’t enter this temple first as it makes all the rest look pale in comparison.

Of the remaining Hindu caves perhaps Cave Twenty One and Cave Twenty Nine the Dhumarlena were the most impressive particularly Cave Twenty Nine which was huge with three large entrances and some stunning carvings.

Next to come were the Five Jain caves, Cave Thirty Two or the Indra Sabha was the finest of these, but I was impressed by them all, it had taken us all morning to walk through the complex yet it seemed like only minutes.

Later we visited the Muslim pilgrimage village of Khuldabad where we
Gaumukha Temple
Lonar
visited the tomb of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, for a man who controlled such vast wealth his tomb was simple and austere. It was then onto the pizza bar where I picked up lunch/dinner and memory card for my camera before returning to the hotel.

Patient with Wilson's Disease (body unable to regulate copper stores)
Dr. M studied the toddler. Unconscious, the whites of the child's eyes were partly visible, and her mouth was widened by the long tube which had been carefully guided through her mouth, past her throat, and into the terminus of her windpipe. And then the good doctor noticed something amiss. The left hand. Why was it so blue...and swollen? He studied the right side. Perfectly normal, nothing to be concerned about over there. But what about this left side? He touched it, manipulated it, felt for pulses, checked the capillary refill. Not good. The IV line, which had been placed on the dorsum of the left hand, was surrounded by evidence of multiple placement attempts. Suddenly, the source of the cyanosis and swelling became clear. He dropped the puny hand, summoned all of his residents into his office immediately, and closed the door behind him. I did not hear what he said, but I would bet that he was chiding his residents for overlooking seemingly simple but enormously significant aspects of patient care. Due to traumatic attempts at IV placement, the child's hand had developed compartment syndrome, which is a large-scale increase in pressure inside the hand (in this case) that
Patient with Mitral valve damage due to Rheumatic Heart Disease (virtually nonexistent in the USA thanks to the way we manage Strep infections)
was threatening the viability of the limb. He called the surgeons into the ward, and they performed an emergency fasciotomy, which thankfully relieved the pressure and saved the child's hand.

And this was a totally honest mistake that went largely unnoticed by everyone except one keen physician. It was especially tough because the child was not conscious to tell us about the inevitable pain that compartment syndrome generally causes. As someone who will be a full-fledged medical resident in 4 months, it is this kind of scenario that frightens me. A situation when things are going terribly wrong, and I would have no idea that a problem even existed. One can only hope that the Gods of Medicine will be looking over me with angelic wisdom. I think it's unlikely. Mistakes are going to be made, and there is going to be a lot of stuff I will just have to deal with. Maybe even tragic stuff. I guess that's part of the job description, which is both exhilarating and mortifying at once. But for the first time, I know I am ready for it.

A hilarious story: so there is a hospital here in Mumbai that specializes
Petechial rash in a girl with Congenital Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia. Word?? I had never even heard of this rare condition! One of the most mature girls I've ever met at the ripe age of 7 years old.
in Infectious Diseases called Kasturba Hospital. From the very beginning, I was told that I could spend a few days at Kasturba, where I could be introduced to diseases like multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, measles, mumps, chicken pox, etc. Basically, the kind of pathology I don't see at home. Well, I received verbal (key word) permission from the Head of Pediatrics here to go to the hospital. But when I showed up, I was directed to the Kasturba chief medical officer and then to the chief medical superintendent, both of whom told me that I would need written authorization to make this happen. Blimey. So then I returned to KEM to reunite with the Pediatrics Dept head, and he informed me that he was not allowed to give me written authorization or anytihng else of the kind. Something about my contract as an international student. But then came his big suggestion: he instructed me to just ""show up"" in the Kasturba wards, and that it would be totally OK. ""Oh yeah, we have visiting students do that all the time. No problem. Just find one of the residents there and see their patients.""

So my friends and I decide to
For even i am not immune. Contact lenses are not welcome in India. This is what happens when you go against this principle.
return the next day to Kasturba...this time in stealth mode. James Bond style. We must not be recognized. We must be quick. But we have no idea where to go. The campus is pretty huge (it's what I picture a lepper-colony to look like). So we stumble through the hospital campus searching for the Infectious Disease ward. My friend Khalid suddenly decides and takes it upon himself to ask someone for help. Before I know what happens next, he flags down the first person he sees and poses his question. But not just any person. It's the chief medical officer. Of all the hundreds people on the campus. We're caught, I think to myself. But somehow, he either doesn't recognize us or he simply doesn't care. He actually points us deviants in the right direction and into the proper ward. Close shave! Obstacle #2: the doctor in the ward asks me point blank, ""Do you have permission to be here?"" ""Uhhh yes,"" I blabber out. So she reflexively picks up the phone and dials the superintendent to make sure. She begins speaking to him. OK, now we're really in the soup. I turn to Khalid and say, ""Let's make a
Me and my cousin Karthik at Gateway of India
run for it."" But he calmly says, ""No wait...look,"" and points at the seated doctor. She calmly puts down the red, Batman-esque phone, and performs the classic bobble-head Indian signal of affirmation. No way...we received approval? She gets up out of her chair and leads us into the ward. Amazing. Obstacle #2 somehow overcome.

That ward was filled with chicken pox patients, young and old. Most of them, surprisingly, were pregnant females in their 20s. When I asked about potential birth defects from the antenatal infection, the doctor insisted that the teratogenic effects of the varicella virus were overstated. Most of the time, the babies turn out normal. I'll have to look further into this. Aside from having had chicken pox myself when I was younger, I have not seen a case since I've been in medical school!

At the completion of our tour, the female doctor suggests that we visit the adjacent ward, where there was a mumps patient and a few other interesting cases. So we walk outside, and almost immediately, we run into Obstacle #3. The chief medical superintendent. On his morning walk. The last person I wanted to see. The jig is up. He

looks livid too. ""You?? What did I tell you yesterday? What did I tell you to bring to me before you could come here?"" ""Buhhhh I don't remember, sir."" That was the first thing that came to mind. Mega fail under pressure. ""What? Do you have amnesia or something? Are you sufffffering...form amnesia?"" he inquired. ""Yes sir, it must be something like that."" The superintendent gritted his teeth, and then just walked past us, huffing and puffing as he did it. The two people we could absolutely not afford to run into during this episode of trespassing were almost the only people we ended up interacting with.

I turned to Khalid and Nasir. ""OK, we should probably go now."" We casually strolled out of the hospital grounds and into a cab. And the rest, as they say, is history.

Mumbai
la Gare Victoria, où Jamal retrouve Latika
Namasté !

On quitte Mumbai ce soir, et honnêtement, elle ne me manquera pas ! Le trajet en train a bien été,mais comme a eu de la misère à se trouver un hotel ! Ça ne m'étais jamais arrivé, et à Phil non plus, on a dû chercher pendant près de 2 heures, avec nos gros backpacks, à 25°C, sous le gros soleil, dans des rues pleines de marchands (et donc, de tannants). Tout était plein ! Sauf si l'on voulait payer 50$ la nuit, bien entendu.. Donc pour le double de ce que l'on payait jusqu'ici, on a trouvé une chambre avec seulement un lit et une mini table comme mobilier, déjà pleine par notre bouteille d'eau, les bouchons d'oreilles, etc. On devait fouiller et sortir nos choses sur nos sacs, sur le sol, où se promenaient des minis coquerelles... Évidemment, elles n'apparaissent qu'une fois la chambre payée! Comme la seule lumière qui brûle, et qui ne brûle qu'une fois la noirceur tombée!

Les employés ont tenté de changer le ballast, en grimpant sur un tabouret....sur notre lit ! Tsé quand je vous dit qu'on n'avait pas d'espace, me croyez-vous ?! Mais au moins on avait 4 salles
Mumbai
Elles aiment ça les bracelets !
de bains! Oui oui, 4! ... communes...

La voisine est finalement venue à notre rescousse en nous prêtant une super invention: une ampoule qui se plug dans une prise !

Est-ce que je vous ai dit que les pannes de courant en Inde sont fréquentes le soir ? On a dû en avoir une à tous les soirs quand on était à Delhi. Voilà pourquoi ils vendent des frontales dans la rue!

Mumbai, ou Bombay pour les plus vieux, est située sur le bord de la mer. Juste pour cette raison je la préfère a Delhi, en plus de son architecture coloniale. Mais n'empêche que ça demeure une grosse ville, avec trop de monde et peu d'endroit tranquille.

On a donc marché dans la ville, mangé des blé d'inde grillés sur la plage, et mangé du McDo dans un centre commercial climatisé ! Bien que j'étais tentée par le Mc Maharaja Chicken, bien j'ai essayé le McVeggi...aux patates. Moi qui ne mange jamais de ni un ni l'autre !

Bref, je n'ai pas grand chose à raconter... Les grandes villes de l'Inde jusqu'ici m'intéressent moins que les plus petites, et je les trouve plus fatiguantes.
Mumbai
Une super funambule pour quelques roupies; moi je lui donne juste pour ses lunettes !
Il ya moins de café et de restaurants avec des terrasses pour relaxer, tout est plus cher mais plus cheap. Bref, on va les éviter et mettre le cap sur la beach pour un peu de ferniente ! On se tape un autre train de nuit ce soir, mais honnêtement, ça ne me dérange pas, j'aime bien le train ! (et il ne peut de toute façon pas être pire que notre chambre ici...).

Hasta luego !

My homies from Afghanistan. I promise to visit these guys in Kandahar one day. Incredibly cool group.
There are separate male and female wards here. Just to emphasize that fact, the two gender-based wards are separated by 2 floors. These wards, as I've demonstrated in some of the photos posted earlier, are essentially colossal rooms crammed with beds from end-to-end. It makes sense that the two adult sexes should be separated, right? But what about the pediatrics population? Did you know that there are no children above the age of 12 in the Pediatric wards? The reasons are fairly straightward: the hospital does not want male and female children, who are ""of age"", to be placed together in the same area. Due to bedside procedures and general physical exams, it can be necessary that the adolescents disrobe, so the inevitable embarassing situation is mitigated by moving the adolescents to their respective gender's adult ward. And, perhaps more importantly, it prevents any sexual misconduct (don't forget consensual hanky-panky, too). One result of this is that Internal Medicine physicians are forced to manage a fairly large adolescent patient load, which traditionally gravitates in the realm of pediatrics. Therefore, these docs have trained themselves to manage both adults and children in the inpatient setting. MED-PEDS represent!

Rounding in the pediatrics
This child has Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return, or TAPVR. This is considered a cyanotic heart condition. It is a big deal, and will require a surgical fix.
ward has been so fulfilling. I have seen such a variety of cases, but the ones that intrinsically entice me are the kiddos with congenital cardiac conditions. I'd argue that their puny size and rapid breathing rate makes them the cutest kids in existence. There is something so rewarding about keenly auscultating (listening with the stethoscope) audible heart murmurs, describing the murmur's character, its intensity, its place in time, and its direction. I estimate the intensity of the ""lub"" and the ""dub"" (heart sounds) and do my best to organize my thoughts to formulate my own diagnosis. Most of the time, echocardiogram summaries are already available for me, so I can check to see how accurate my diagnosis is. I must admit I'm getting pretty good at this. And not just the cardiac exam. When you have this many malaria (spleen), alcoholic (liver), and tuberculosis (lungs, brain, peritoneum, etc.) patients, you start getting a great ""feel"" for various parts of the body.

After all, one of the main reasons I came here was to hone my physical exam skills in the presence of the very best in the business. No matter who your source is, KEM's physicians always earn
TAPVR on chest x-ray
hefty accolades for their exceptionally good and unparalleled physical exam skills. A thorough, well-calculated physical exam is an undeniably vital component to a physician's healing touch, and patients REALLY appreciate it. How many times have you heard friends and family say something to this effect: ""My doctor barely layed a finger on me. He just asked me some questions, wrote a prescription, and I got a bill for $100 in the mail. What gives?"" Talk about erosion of the physician-patient relationship! The physical exam connects you to your patients in ways that detached, esoteric lab values cannot. I think its a simple truth that is overlooked far too often.

And while I'm at it, let me make a plug for the Stanford 25: http://medicine.stanford.edu/education/stanford_25.html

We have all seen the studies, however, that demonstrate that the physical exam can oftentimes be unreliable. I get that. It is definitely subjective. Given the incredible advances medicine has seen as recently as the last 20 years, no one is saying that we should ditch laboratory tests and body imaging in favor of clinical findings. But you can't tell me that we haven't gone way too far in the other direction. And the
Adorable 2 year old with a patent ductus arteriosus. Great example of the continuous, machine-like murmur.
result is dissatisfied patients, technology-dependent physicians, and increased health care costs. Big problems, huh? We definitely need to triangulate a more balanced approach. With my plan to enter academic medicine one day, you can bet that I am going to be a huge champion for the physical exam. It's fun, it's cerebral, and I think it makes you a more complete doctor.

Maybe the best thing about these kids is that they don't care that I don't speak Hindi or Marathi. A smile is all it takes to get their attention and start our interaction. A smile is all you need to reassure a concerned parent as you flip through their child's paper chart. Of course, some of these children are so profoundly ill that it pains me to even look at them. Thankfully, the average kid is far more resilient than your average adult. Fever of 103, an uncomfortable bed, a noisy environment that is sleep prohibitive, no matter. When I position my stethoscope over their heart and put the sound into their ears, they always get that initial inquisitive look, a gleam in their eye, and that wry smile of recognition. Man, I live for that.

Outpatient room
In my outpatient clinic last Friday morning, I saw about 15 patients with my team. Tenof them had Tuberculosis in one form or another. So far, during the last 3 weeks, I have seen pulmonary TB, TB meningitis, TB peritonitis, TB tuberculoma, disseminated TB. I had always heard that syphilis was considered to be the ""Great Imitator,"" but how it could eclipse Mycobacterium in its various forms is beyond me.

Due to the advent of multi-drug resistant TB in Mumbai, all patients diagnosed with this infection are started on AKT (Anti-Koch's therapy, as it is called here) immediately in the hospital setting. When they are stable for discharge, they return within 1-2 weeks for follow-up on their condition, where they receive an update on the sensitivities of their cultures. This follow-up is a great time to discuss whether the patient is dealing with a multi-drug resistant strain or not. If they are, then the treatment is adjusted at this appointment.

For the last 2 days, I have switched over to the Pediatrics side. The physician I rounded with this morning is named Dr. Vinand Deshmukh, and he is one heck of a domineering personality. He is that classic, confrontational,
Outpatient room
in-your-face, academic clinician that is oft-alluded to and feared by medical students. It is amusing to watch him hound his residents as they meekly present their patients to him. It's an inevitable and perpetual ""pimping"" session that takes no prisoners, and boy, does he know his stuff. He even doggedly questioned his subjects about recent health care news pertinent to India. Needless to say, there were blank stares. He even went after me today. Clearly, I will be cut no slack in his presence. Since rounds were so intense, I did not have a chance to take very many photos today, but have no fear, I'll get them to you soon.

Interesting cases from the day:

1) Kwashiorkor - young patient with distended abdomen, chubby cheeks, and pedal edema. For those who don't know, this is a diagnosis given to patients who have severely inadequate protein intake. Because of the lack of protein, fluid osmotically shifts out of the blood vessels and into the tissues, where it gives you the false impression that the child is well-fed. Food is carefully being administered to avoid the dreaded Refeeding Syndrome.

2) TB Meningitis in a child with congenital hydrocephalus
The Gateway of India


3) A beastly congenital dilated cardiomyopathy in a 2 month old child. One of the residents claimed to hear an S3. The kid's heart rate was 160 beats/min, so I have my doubts about that one :-)

4) Spastic cerebral palsy - I am not sure exactly how to classify this as of now, but I will look it up. This kid was really interesting. His upper and lower extremities were so hypertonic (tightened) that I had to use a good amount of strength to extend his arms and legs. He had a great demonstration of multi-beat clonus in both ankles and he was hyper-reflexive bilaterally. However, at 17 months of age, he had absolutely NO control of his neck musculature. His neck was as floppy as a newborn's.



That's all I have for now. I promise the next one will be more entertaining!



In the meantime, take a look at how much fun I've been having! Yaaaaay!

Dr. Yasmine conducting rounds
I figured it out! There is a local government body called the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), which amongst other things, funds and operates KEM Hospital to serve Mumbai's urban poor. It has allowed the hospital to evolve into the massive tertiary care center that is has become. Cost of care for the citizenry is heavily subsidized by the MCGM, which operates on an enormous budget funded by taxpayers. I suppose this is not unlike how our county hospitals operate under state tax revenues in the USA, but because of the high volume of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in India, KEM is able to provide cheap medicines that would be enormously expensive in the USA. For example, Zosyn (Piperacillin-Tazobactam), our famous shotgun-approach IV antibiotic, is priced at a mere fraction of the cost here. I would be willing to bet, however, that a number of the generics produced here violate patent laws, but that's just a guess.

I always assumed that patient protection laws were completely absent in India, as evidenced by my liberal digital camera shots. But Indian health care is changing every day. Even in a hospital like KEM, which is a treatment center largely for the indigenous
Great example of clubbing
poor, ""medico-legal"" cases are becoming more prominent. The philosophy of diligent and proper documentation is gaining more and more traction here, and Dr. N.D Karnik is at the forefront of that cultural shift. On rounds, he is very quick to bring up the medico-legal issues about a number of cases, urging (and even pleading, on some occasions) his residents to frame every case as if a lawyer was going to be pining through the chart at any moment. To paraphrase his message, ""It means ass if you fail to document properly."" And this is a very, very public hospital, mind you. You can imagine that its an even greater focal point at private hospitals.

Lack of preventative health care really shows here. I can't tell you how many patients I have seen in my mere 2 weeks who are admitted into the hospital with end-stage kidney disease, thanks to totally uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension (the 2 chief reasons for kidney failure, not only here but in the USA too. Ranjani, I would love for you to weigh in on this). It seems like every second patient has an AV-fistula for dialysis. And it is not their fault in
Clubbing from a chronic respiratory disease
most cases. So many of the patients here are barely making ends meet. They are working like dogs at their job, and they have many mouths to feed at home. To ask them to follow up regularly with a primary care doctor, check their blood pressure and sugar regularly, and purchase medicines is a fool's errand. What's more, lack of education and distrust of allopathic medicine don't help the cause.

A stark example: A young boy recently diagnosed with Tuberculosis Meningitis was taken home by his grandmother, because she believed natural therapy was all he needed. Also, the boy's income was helping to feed the family. His family could not afford for him to stay at the hospital any longer. This kid got treatment for only 2 days when, in order to treat this disease, he will require 9 months of treatment. And now he's back at home. He is going to die, plain and simple. I nearly pulled my hair out when I found out that he had left.

OK OK sorry for the buzzkill post. Here are some of the interesting cases I have seen in the last couple of days! You can see pictures from
Neurocystercercosis calcification with surrounding edema
some of the cases below!

1) Neurocystercercosis - the parasite Taenia solium is responsible for this infection of the brain. It is actually a tapeworm that usually comes from ingestion of poorly cooked pork. This patient was a Muslim, so don't ask me how he ended up getting this. He presented with adult-onset epilepsy, which is the most common presentation of this. I have a nice picture of the CT scan below. Treatment depends on whether the parasite is alive or dead. Albendazole is the anti-helminthic of choice with anti-convulsants also required.

2) Liver abscesses caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This crafty parasite lives in your large intestine until it decides to burrow into your venous circulation and follow the portal circulation to the liver. The big things you see are fever + chills + significant abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, and weight loss (sometimes). Bloody diarrhea occurs very rarely and did not occur in my patient. My patient also suffers from alcoholic liver disease, so at this point, his liver is basically useless. Treatment is generally very effective, and Metronidazole is the drug of choice.

3) Malaria - OK, maybe this isn't all that exciting
Multiple liver abscesses due to Amoebiasis
to you, but hey, I never see this at home!

4) Syringomyelia in a kid with Arnold Chiari Malformation Type I - I did not realize that these two conditions actually carry an association. He had the classic symptoms of loss of pain and temperature sensation in his upper extremities. In fact, he even burned himself unknowingly on a number of occasions!

5) Tuberculosis meningitis - as I mentioned above. Apparenly, the BCG vaccine that Europeans get can protect you against this form of TB, although it doesn't work well against the pulmonary kind. Treatment is just like with pulmonary TB.



That's all I have for now! It's election day in Mumbai, and everything is shut down. It's basically a holiday. Take note, USA.

Mumbai or Bombay as it was known earlier is really a fast paced city, something of a cross between New York and Los Angeles. It is the commercial capital of India and is known for producing the largest number of films each year. Think Bollywood and Slum Dog Millionaire…Jai Ho. After my wonderful shopping and bargaining in Delhi and Jaipur, I travelled to Mumbai by flight. There are plenty of low cost carriers which fly at an interval of 1 hour.

A swanky new airport and hordes of cheap taxis (no nonsense drivers who take you to your destination easily) will make your travelling pretty easy. To avoid being stuck in rush hour traffic jams that can last 2 hours, avoid travelling during 9 -10 in the morning and 6 – 7 in the evening.

A must watch is the Gateway of India that was built to commemorate the landing of King George V in 1920. On November 28, 2008 it was the target of terrorist attack along with Taj Mahal and Oberoi hotels, which are the swankiest hotels in Mumbai.

Gateway of India is where the sea just stretches out. It’s the Arabian Sea and there is really nothing between here and Dubai. Well that’s what my personal guide Suleiman told me, my Bombay taxiwala and guide. I took ajetty; well they are more like Catamarans, which take you around the harbor and the port. It’s a really nice thing to do, especially after the chill in Delhi and Jaipur. I took Suleiman and he pointed out things to see, while we were out in the open waters.The Elephata and Ajanta rock caves are just a distance from here, but I wasn’t in the mood, so we dropped the plan. The jetty ride cost just under Rs 25 or about $0.5. Suleiman doesn’t live in Mumbai, but actually travels from Manor (something like a suburb, so he takes jetty taxi or travels on the local trains.

That done, Suleiman showed off the heritage buildings and the more happening museums and art galleries. I was quite content on seeing them from outside and was dying to get a taste of my favorite drink. Now I really wanted to chill out.

Suleiman suggested that we go to the highly recommended Leopold Café (just ask anyone) which is brimming with local Mumbaites and foreigners. I loved this place, because the energy and people in it are incomparable. Now I ordered for my favorite Godfather Beer and looked for some heartwarming pasta…Yummy! Interestingly, Mumbai has a number of low cost cafes and pubs which offer delicious food that’s fresh, try them instead of going to the expensive restaurants.

In the evening, I was invited to Suleiman’s house for dinner and we took the night time ferry to Manori. Since he’s a Muslim, his wife had made beef curry with a thick gravy and some homemade breads known as Naan. Truly delicious and later they gave me Phirni (something of rice custard). The hospitality of the Indians just amazes me.

So I took a taxi back to my hotel in south Mumbai and looked out of the window. Got to tell you, Mumbai does look great in the night with the tall skyscrapers and the lovely twinkling lights along with the Queens necklace. Tomorrow is my flight to Goa…sunshine, beer and fun, here I come. Cheerios

No surprise here, I guess :-)
Saturday was a very low-key day at KEM. The emergency room was calm, the medical ward was only sparsely occuped, and the highly unusual cases were nowhere to be seen. Sunday is a holiday for medical students, so I took advantage by doing non-medical stuff!

On Saturday after rounds, a Seth GS Medical College student named Rahul, whom I had met a few days prior, invited me, Khaled, and Nasir to his home in Virar, a suburb that is found on at the very last stop of the Mumbai Western rail line. It was a good 1.5 hours from the hospital. This is actually a very common practice in Indian culture as a whole. Whether north, south, east, or west Indian (or any other differentiation you feel like making), the rules of hospitality remain congruent throughout the country. In this case, Rahul invited us to spend time with him and his mother in Virar, have dinner at his home, stay the night, and see the famous Jivdani temple early the following morning. The three of us were, of course, totally game. We were able to discuss a number of subjects at length during our little getaway, including America-India foreign policy,
Packed like sardines just getting to the platform!
medical school training the Indian way, and the status of the caste system in India, just to name a few ""minor"" subjects. All in all, it was great fun. Rahul was a stupendously good host, and his mother topped it off with a wonderful meal.

Jivdani is found on a hill overlooking the city of Virar, and it is most definitely the main attraction of the city. In recent years, it has become very well known among general Mumbaians (if that's the correct word), and on this Sunday morning, we barely beat the massive amount of traffic. It is 1375 steps high, so one can imagine that it was one hell of a good workout just getting to the top. The religious fervor the few was definitely on display, with several people literally crawling up the steps on all fours. I cannot imagine the agony of doing that. I am told that this is done by those who are seeking something of high value or esteem from the Lord, and therefore, this will be their sacrifice. Now that's commitment.

The view from the top was very beautiful, but all hell seemed to break loose when I popped out
This train-station dog appears to be eating enough, wouldn't you say?
my camera for a few snaps. Apparently this temple has been under threat by radicals, and so half the temple grounds are now blocked off from the public, including the upper levels with the most picturesque view of the city. And, of course, digi-cams are a no-no. (Sigh). How sad it is when the madness of a few affects the simple liberties of the rest. We Americans can definitely relate to that sentiment.

And last night, I had a dream come true. One of my favorite groups, Remember Shakti, happened to be having a performance in Navi Mumbai. Ticketless, I ventured out into the newest areas of the city, found well east of the central region. Thankfully, the people of Mumbai are so incredibly friendly that I was able to hop from train to train with a great deal of help and little inhibition. After reaching Navi Mumbai, I met a guy named Nikhil who, like me, was trying to get to Central Park Amphitheater, where the concert was being held. We became instant friends, and when we reached the venue, he actually aided me in obtaining a ticket on the cheap! We enjoyed the enlightening performance together, one
Khaled, Nasir, and Rahul
in which John McLaughlin, U Srinivas, Zakir Hussain, Shankar Mahadevan, and Vikku Vinayakaram were simply at their best. Rhythmically, this group uses structure that I simply don't even comprehend. They are able to meld jazz and Indian classical music so fluidly that it is no wonder that they are considered the greatest fusion group on the planet. Do yourself a favor and watch this video of what they can do.

Hi Everyone,

Harder than we thought to get internet in Mumbai, hense the latepost. Obviously we made it to Mumbai, and have just arrived in Hanoi, very tired I may add.

We made it safely to Mumbai, even survived the crazy cab ride to the hotel. Unfortunetly we were unable to book a train ticket to the Taj Mahal for when we needed it, and with our experience of Mumbai so far we were not going to risk getting stuck somewhere. However, things worked out and we spent the rest of our days in Mumbai seeing the elephant caves, lost of museums, galleries, shopping, world heritage sites etc. We booked a private tour guide and a car, so we got to see lots. It was about 28 degrees but with a nice breeze so bareable.

Unfortunetly on sunday our flight from Mumbai to Bangkok was not till 01:55 so we had some time to kill in the airport which wasn't easy. We had a bit of a wait at Bangkok before our flight to Hanoi but eventually we landed in Hanoi at 14:30 today (monday), so were pretty tired. But all is good now as we have booked a 3 day junk boat tour around Halong Bay for tomorrow, so that will be a nice way to spend Valentines. Hopefully the weather wont be as bad as today, its only about 18 and cloudy and grey but should still be good fun. We leave Hanoi on sunday, so we will fill our other 2 days with more site seeing.

Chat soon
Lots of Love xxxxxxxxxxxx

Tuk-Tuk!
I was just a teeny bit excited to ride a tuk-tuk.
On Friday, Griff and tackled the Pune Challenge, which is part of the Sangam programme. It was really exciting to do something that event participants would get to do, even though I was an independent guest.

To explain, you can attend Sangam as an event participant. Sangam runs events throughout the year with specific themes. Events are seven to ten days long, and run somewhat like a camp for adults. Some events are more serious and have a goal, such as focusing on one of the Global Action Themes (e.g. “Girls worldwide say we can save our planet”) from the UN Millennium Development Goals. Others are designed more to meet Guiding and Scouting members around the world.

When someone visits Sangam outside of those times or without registering for an event, they are an independent guest. There wasn’t an event taking place when Griff and I visited Sangam because they were getting ready for their next event, focusing around World Thinking Day. For those not in Guiding or Scouting, World Thinking Day is like celebrating Girl Guides’ birthday. It would have been incredible to be at Sangam for World Thinking Day, but as you can imagine, they were booked
Pune University
I really enjoyed this sign at the entrance to the university.
solid.

To attend an event at a World Centre, you need to book your place at least a year in advance, depending on the centre. I attended an event at Our Chalet, one of the other world centres in Switzerland, when I was fifteen. I’ll come back to the World Centres in a later blog entry.

Anyways, back to the Pune Challenge. Griff and I had a tuk-tuk for the afternoon to go to various places in Pune to explore. This was definitely a “challenge by choice”, as we decided ahead of time how many places we wanted to go to, based on the time we had. We visited Pune University (there are a number of universities in Pune), a palace where Gandhi was locked up, a war memorial and MG (Mahatma Gandhi) Road. MG Road is a main shopping area. Griff and I went to this awesome coffee shop called Barista.

Before Griff and I left for the Pune Challenge, I saw on the Sangam bulletin board that I could get a sari tailored by a woman who comes to Sangam regularly. When I talked to Christa, she suggested that I have a punjabi suit made,
Pune Sunset
The sun was setting as we were heading back to Sangam.
but I would need to buy the fabric and have it tailored by a man named Mr. Singh on MG Road. I could not find Mr. Singh’s tailor shop anywhere, and there were a lot of textile stores. Boooooo.

Patient recovering from Leprosy
As a medical student, going on rounds at KEM is very fun, plain and simple. As I mentioned before, your clinical responsibilities are fewer than back at home, but the learning opportunities are arguably better. You are expected to listen attentively, take notes, and examine patients when interesting physical findings pop up on your patients. Not only that, but the sheer number of people managed by a single doctor is so vast that the diversity of pathology is unparalleled. You see just about everything here, and you definitely have the time and flexibility to assiduously examine the patients with the most noteworthy findings.

Because there is usually such a large group of students (I'd say 3 or 4 layers worth) sheepishly following their senior doctor, there is a lot of background discussion amongst the students about physiology, pathology, and who can regurgitate the most information about a diagnosis in the least amount of time. Some things are true across the board when it comes to medical students :-) Geography be damned.

India recently achieved a major milestone that was lauded by health care organizations around the globe. It has been over a year since a new polio case was
Lower extremity muscular wasting from poliomyelitis
diagnosed, indicating that major efforts by the World Health Organization (featured in one of Atul Gawande's books) and the Indian government were bearing fruit. While it is something to be celebrated, there are so many people ACTIVELY suffering from the ravages of poliomyelitis. On the beautiful KEM campus, you see it all over the place. There is a very characteristic walk for patients with post-polio syndrome (PPS), and you can see it here: <a href=""
you can see, it can be unilateral or bilateral. The first girl you see has excellent muscle tone in one leg with muscle wasting in the other. The second girl has bilateral atrophy, and there is so little muscle left in her legs that they look noodle-ish and bend as such. You can see photos of my polio-stricken patient below.

Of course, no trip like this is complete without a good bit of sightseeing. My friends and I visited Mani Bhavan, the Mumbai home of Gandhiji where he lived from 1917-1934. It is also the place where he began to practice satyagraha, which my colleague Wikipedia has defined as ""insistance on truth."" Satyagraha, as I've come to understand it, was Gandhi's practice of civil
Intrinsic hand muscle wasting from polio
disobedience and non-violent means, which he aptly practiced unwaveringly until the very end of his life. Ironically, it was at the hands of a violence that he met his end. Mani Bhavan has been transformed into a beautiful museum depicting Gandhi's illustrious life. I think it is a must-see for anyone visiting Mumbai.

We also dropped by Chowpatty Beach to get some ""fresh"" air, corn-on-the-cob, and epic pav bhaji. Somehow, I haven't started doubling over with stomach pain, so I will chalk it up to the kindness of the goddess Durga (see below). After that, we just wanted to keep eating, so we had some delicious Channa batura at Cream Centre restaurant. Easily the most expensive meal I have eaten in Mumbai so far, costing me a whopping $9. I love this city :-)

Mumbai Airport
The arrivals area of the Mumbai airport is outside!
On Thursday, we traveled from Bangkok, Thailand to Pune, India (pronounced Poona, for those wondering). Aside from when we flew to Korea, this has been our longest transportation day so far. For the sake of trying to keep things in the same time zone, I’ll start by saying we left the hostel in Bangkok at 8:30 Indian Time (10am in Bangkok, since *someone* refused to pack the night before). Getting to the airport took more than an hour by Sky Train and Airport Express train (both of which were quite packed). I was anxious, since our reservation said to be at check in at least three hours before departure (15:05). We arrived at the airport around 12:30. I was not impressed, since I knew how insane Thai immigration was when we arrived. There was a big line for check in.

Pause. I need to write for a moment about luggage. Griff was perhaps complaining (only perhaps!) about how heavy his belongings were. His stuff is packed in a large backpack (my old one), day pack and laptop case. My belongings are in my big red backpack with the day pack that can zip off. I have been so grateful for my backpack this trip. It has made long journeys a breeze. On multiple occasions, I’ve let Griff sit down on a subway because of how heavy/awkward his luggage was (for example, if only one seat comes available. Griff would often offer it to me, but I knew that he was struggling with his belongings). Part of it for me is that once I take it off, it’s a pain to put back on. Anyways, so we did our luggage weigh-in at BKK. My checked luggage was weighed first – 17.5kg. Then Griff’s checked luggage was weighed – 9.5kg. I guess I must be a tank. 😊

Anyways, so after check-in, we went to immigration. There was a line, but it was nothing compared to when we arrived in Bangkok. We waited about twenty minutes, and I was feeling a little better. They had shifted our boarding time forward a bit, so I was still anxious. Someone (read: not me) did not fill out his departure card for immigration (not the first time this has happened), and was perhaps vocal in his frustration. I’d already gone through immigration before him. I got told that I was not permitted to wait behind the immigration booth, and to go to security. I waited at the earliest place I was allowed to – the entrance to security. After waiting for fifteen minutes or so, I wandered back to immigration to see that Griff was gone. I had NO CLUE where he was or if he’d been pulled for questioning based on how much he’d voiced his frustration. When I asked a customs official, she told me that he’d already passed through. Griff was nowhere in sight at security. Keep in mind that this has been the only flight that we haven’t had time on our side to start with. I waited and went through security. Although I did not set off the metal detector, I still got a pat down because my bag beeped going through the x-ray. I’d forgotten to take my children’s blunt tip scissors out of my pencil case (gasp!). This resulted in the security officer going completely through my bag and me receiving a thorough lecture about how the scissors were not permitted (I forgot, I swear!). Still no sign of Griff, and the clock is ticking. I book it to our gate (for once the closest gate, even though it was about 500m away). Griff blasted me about why I left him.

I do not lose my temper and yell often, nevermind in public, nevermind around a lot of people. I will just say I used some “choice words” to express my frustration, considering I felt like *I’d* been ditched. Lets also say that my mouth would have been well washed out with soap at the time. I was VERY frustrated.

The flight to India felt like it took forever, based on my disposition throughout the flight. I felt like Alexander in “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day” and wanted to move to Australia. I had to constantly remind myself that not only were we going to India, we were going to Sangam.

After arriving in Mumbai, we went through immigration fairly quickly, exchanged some currency and headed out of the airport. We were both quite hungry at this point, but there were no food options at arrivals. Once you were outside luggage pick-up (literally, outside), there were some kiosks with snacks and soft drinks, but that was about it.

I had realized on the plane that I thought Priyanka’s email had said something about the driver meeting us at the domestic terminal. We were at the international terminal. We flew with IndiGo, which is primarily a domestic airline, but this flight was international, and therefore arriving at the international terminal. As we later learned, they are really different airports. They share a runway, but that’s about all they share. They otherwise run completely independent of each other. When the driver had not arrived about half an hour after we got out of the airport (he was supposed to have a sign with my name on it), I called Priyanka to ask. It turned out that the driver had gone to the domestic airport, but she’d call him and have him come to the international airport to pick us up instead. They’re a thirty minute drive from each other.

So the driver comes, and we load our bags into his car. Not only were we picked up by car (which was amazing, rather than going by rickshaw at that point in time), it had air conditioning, and space. It took about two hours to drive out of Mumbai because of the gridlock, and another three hours to Sangam. We arrived at Sangam just after midnight, and by the time we talked to Priyanka, checked in and settled in, it was about 2am. Talk about a long day!

The main hospital entrance
To start off, KEM Medical students = awesome. So friendly, so smart, so hard-working. I am very impressed with what I have seen from them so far. I've also been able to become friends with the foreign medical students that are here. Khaled and Nasir Khan are originally from Afghanistan, but they go to medical school in China (and they speak Mandarin!). They are my suitemates, and we have spent a great deal of time together. They have been invaluable to me as patient translators, as their Hindi is so solid. I have also had the pleasure of meeting Katie Dickson & Sam from the UK, Genevieve Verrastro from the USA, and Ninad Apte from Germany.

During the last 2 days, I have had the pleasure of spending time with Dr. Nikhil Karnik in different clinical settings. His prowess in diagnostics, his easygoing personality, and his eloquence with English has made him my go-to guy for Internal Medicine. He is a phenomenally good teaching professor, and I must say that he seems to be giving me preferential treatment due to the fact that I do not speak Hindi. That's how much he wants me to benefit from this experience. Plus,
Dr. Nikhil Karnik, the Sherlock Holmes of Doctors
he is generally interested in how American health care works, so he always makes it a point to ask me about how much this drug costs or that disease is managed back at home. He is a very enlightened soul, and I hope to spend a great deal of time with him on this rotation.

I have seen some very interesting cases in the MICU/wards with Dr. Karnik. Here is a quick breakdown of some of patient illnesses I came across.



1) Pregnant woman with Hepatitis E who is in fulminant liver failure, on a ventilator, and barely hanging onto her life.

2) 2 cases of post-infectious Guillan Barre Syndrome, something that is seen very rarely in the United States. They have presented in different ways, and one of the cases is someone who has had it for the 2nd time and is now severely and permanently debiliated.

3) Tetanus - very rarely seen in the United States due to vaccination in childhood. This guy had significantly increased muscle tone, but is doing well.

4) Empyema - young girl who has a raging pneumonia, and who has now developed bilateral foot drop and
Dr. Karnik on rounds, surrounded by medical students

weakness in the intrinsic muscles of the hand. Also concerning for Guillan Barre Syndrome.

5) Organophosphate poisoning - pesticide ingestion is a common way to attempt suicide in India, especially amongst farmers who have fallen on hard times.

6) Rat poison suicide attempt - apparently, ingestion of this (not the kind related to Warfarin) will cause liver failure due to the high phosphate content.

7) Tuberculosis - my patient has had 2 previous active infections, and he returned to the ED with compaints of fever, chills, and weight loss. He has significant physical findings in his right lung fields, and his Chest X-ray demonstrates multiple cavitary lesions. And I was definitely exposed, as is every other physician, student, and health care worker here. Sunjay, welcome to a likely positive PPD.



Another great professor has been one in the emergency department, one we endearingly refer to as Dr. Yasmine. She is someone who definitely will ""pimp you"" in the ED, but not in a malignant way. She is very young, but she is so accomplished and intelligent that she has shot up the ranks in KEM academia. In fact, I am told she is one
Permanent disability after 2 bouts of Guillan Barre Syndrome
of the senior Internal Medicine clinicians now. The ED works a bit differently here than at home, as the doctors are located at their desk space, and the patients come to them to be evaluated. If warranted, they are then shuttled over to the ""interns"" desk, where an IV line can be placed. These MBBS students in their final year have absolutely no problem placing lines or even doing Arterial Blood Gas studies. High volume means a hell of a lot of time to practice and perfect their craft, so they do these procedures efficiently and effectively. I have been fortunate enough to have a crack at a few, but no success so far. Then, patients are given instructions to head to the pharmacy to purchase their medications (if they are able to) or they are placed in a bed if their condition is serious enough. Once must remember that many patients enter KEM's doors in the very late stages of their illness, so I have already witnessed many deaths in the ED, including children. Not a happy scene when something like that happens.



One major theme I come across often is the heavily reduced cost of
Bilateral foot drop from Guillan Barre Syndrome
many drugs used in India. Since it is a government hospital, I am sure they are able to have medicines subsidized, but KEM has also made great strides in the creation of their own products. For example, Dr. Karnick mentioned to me that KEM has been producing its own albumin (a vital protein produced by our liver) product that can be given intravenously. Albumin is a very expensive medicine, costing hundreds of dollars per vial at home. At KEM, they are able to provide a few days worth of albumin without cost for their patients, and then a discounted rate of 50%. Another interesting example is the procurement of Zosyn, which is a very heavy-duty antibiotic. At home, hospitals will charge hundreds of dollars per day for its use, whereas KEM is able to purchase the drug for its patients at a fraction of the cost. I have no clue how they are able to do this, but I will try to find out. Anyone have any ideas?



That's all for now. Dhanyavaad!

Hostel 1
Namaste, everyone! Glad you're here! I'm reporting live from an internet cafe across the street from King Edward Memorial Hospital in Parel district of Mumbai. This is one of the most famous teaching hospitals in the entire nation (probably behind AIMS in Delhi), and I will be here for the next month or so. Initially, I was set on doing only Infectious Disease work, but I have had a change of heart and am going to be on both the General Medicine and General Pediatrics teams. Apparently, I'll get my fill of infectious diseases in these realms though.

Mumbai appears to a wonderfully large city with a friendly populace. I can already tell that my inability to speak Hindi is definitely going to dull the experience to a certain degree, but I find that my skill for gesticulation and haltingly-spoken English words are enough to get by. One thing's for sure: my fluency in Spanish is of no use here. Charu, where are you when I need you??

Perhaps it was my naivety, but I foolishly thought that I could arrive this morning at 11:15AM, get to the hospital by 12, get registered for my coursework, and then get
Hostel 2
started on the wards. Boy, was I wrong. I spent the better part of today getting registered with the hospital, despite already having gone through a VERY extensive application process over the last 4-5 months. I had to get 6 copies made of my student visa, my already-submitted application, my 2x2 passport photo, my ""Gymkhana fees"" receipt, my tuition fees receipt (which I had to obtain standing in line at the bank for over an hour), and a couple of other items. It's absurd because I ALREADY did all of this when I applied. Needless to say, I won't be starting today.

I also checked into my room, which is located inside the KEM Boys Hostel. The medical students who stay here are officially in Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College, and KEM is their chief teaching institution. Apparently, the general medical students' hostels are in a horrid, dilapidated condition, while we visiting students placed in the hostel ""guest rooms"" encounter more sanitary conditions. It's definitely not bad at all. I definitely need to buy some sheets, since using the default ones seems like a terrible idea. Check out the pictures below!

I have already met a couple of
Universal influence
medical students who have been super friendly and helpful. One guy, Neerav Shah, shares a common interest in medical administration. In fact, he plans on forgoing a clinical medicine residency in favor of pursuing his MBA. Not my cup of tea, but a very respectable decision in an interesting field. He is an ""intern,"" which is analagous to a 4th year medical student back at home. I get the feeling after talking to him that medical students in India have significantly less clinical responsibilities than US medical students. Neerav mentioned to me that he is not really involved directly in coming up with a plan for patients, though he is expected to carry out the orders prescribed by his senior faculty. I suppose their real experience comes during the post-MBBS training they receive.

That's all for now. Be back again soon.

Me and Camilla
We left Udaipur early (as always) and headed south, the next 4 nights would be spent camping, 3 of these in the wild. Despite the early start I made sure to get up in time to take a shower as I was all too aware that I would be smelling and feeling pretty savage after 4 days without a shower. We covered a decent distance today crossing from the dry and mostly flat deserts of Rajasthan into the soaring valleys of Uttar Pradesh, many of these lush and green (albeit because of manmade irrigation). The change in scenery across a relatively small timeframe was dramatic as was the rise in temperature and for the first time on the tour my very white bean poles were exposed to the Indian sun (and very happy they were about it too).

We setup camp a few miles outside of a very rural village among golden semi-arid rolling hills. Ancient abandoned and ruined temples littered the landscape much as tin mines do at home in Cornwall. It was a pretty special place to camp especially with the sun setting spectacularly over the hills. After many days in busy Indian cities and on the death
Waterfall at Ajanta caves
trap Indian roads it was nice to be somewhere with a little peace and quiet and well off the tourist trail. I love bush camping (when it’s warm anyway) especially in a group. The beautiful setting, campfire and circular seating pattern help to create a relaxed atmosphere where conversation, beer drinking and friendships flourish. It always feels really special and a real privilege to be camping in a remote place most people would never see. Another privilege of bush camping is bush toileting aka digging your own toilet with a spade. I was lucky enough to get to bush poop on my first night, ohh what a privilege! Saying that it beat using most of the squalid squat toilets we stopped at throughout the day. We all noticed this evening (and in the day) that the temperature was significantly higher, and about bloody time too, I didn’t come to India to get cold!!! I slept well tonight and would continue to do so for the next few days.

Over the following few days we bush camped by a lake and also on the edge of a farm. We also visited enroute the ancient ruined city of Mandu, previously home
Ajanta
to the pleasure loving Governor of Malwa who kept a Harem of 200 ladies! The city was interesting however without a guide there was little to keep us here for long and by this point we were all feeling a little jaded with the inevitable fort and temple overload. In the following two days we visited respectively both the Ajanta and Ellora caves. The Ajanta caves contain Buddhist monasteries, temples, sculptures and frescoes, some dating back to 200BC. The whole site is huge and took around 1000 years to complete, you can believe this when you consider they were using just a basic chisel and hammer to carve out the vast network of caves. The site was abandoned in 600ad and slowly overtime buried underground and forgotten until being discovered by a British hunting party in 1819, after which work began to excavate the site. Fortunately the burial of the site for over 1,200 years has helped preserve the frescoes and sculptors inside the caves. Of particular interest is a beautiful 200ad picture of Buddha which is painted in 3d as opposed to the usual 2d artwork of the time. Our guide compared the quality of the work to the
Me and Sonia at Ellora
Mona Lisa although I wasn’t convinced by this comparison. While wondering the caves I noticed how disgusting we smelt and how feral we looked, it had been 3 days without a shower and in the humid heat things were starting to get pretty bad. That evening, I along with several others in the group found a tap and hand basin and used it to wash ourselves as best we could, tomorrow was shower day, excitement was in the air. The following day we visited the Ellora caves which were great, but after you have seen a life times worth of caves the day before they were sadly not particularly interesting. More exciting and enjoyable was our free afternoon and our first opportunity for many days to have a shower! After probably the best shower ever (or so it felt, I spent the day lazing around in the sun sleeping and reading, bliss.

February 5th 2012
Published: February 5th 2012


After a long, hot and arduous 11 hour drive we arrived in Mumbai. We stopped enroute at the only fully fledged western style motorway service station we would stop at in all India. Normally none of us or anyone in their right mind would be excited about stopping at a motorway service station, however ub this instance the Indian services gave the group their first opportunity (and last for a long time after Mumbai) to eat McDonalds. Predictably (myself included) we all ate at the golden arches, some going back for seconds. I ate a fiery chicken burger, fries and coke. I was disappointed, although not surprised, to see that beef wasn’t served here, strictly chicken and paneer only. My meal was like all McDonalds meals, shit. However, I did enjoy the build up throughout the day of feverish anticipation and excitement at eating in a well known and for some reason much loved western establishment, despite knowing the end result would be disappointing. Much like a serial dater, the thrill was in the chase rather than the end result.

The Rough Guide describes Mumbai (population 16 million) as a “rite of passage to be survived rather than savoured” and Huxley described Mumbai city as the “worst of either hemisphere”, I can only assume they visited a different city altogether as my impression (and that of the group) was that Mumbai is a fantastic, beautiful and very green city. True the city is huge but it also has beautiful green trees lining most streets, fantastic colonial architecture and a nice stretch of beach in the city centre. Of particular note is the stunning Gothic style, British built Victoria Terminus train station which I sadly only saw from the outside and didn’t get any photos. I was enjoying my time in Mumbai so much that I decided I would stay an extra night and catch up with the group by flying down to Goa. Sadly I rather misspent my time in Mumbai after two heavy nights on the town resulted in crippling hangovers wherby I saw more of my hotel walls than the city. I did however find time to buy a nice new net book and also take part in a Bollywood dance class which was ridiculous but great fun. Ask me when I get home and I’ll show you my Bollywood moves, I’m sure you will be impressed.

An optional tour in Mumbai was the Dheeravi slum tour. Dheeravi is the slum where the excellent Slumdog Millionaire was based. I decided against the slum tour as I was concerned the tour would be voyeuristic and of little benefit to those in the slum. After reading a friends (Ola) dissertation on slum tourism in the Kibero slums, Nairobi I wasn’t convinced that slum tourism was particularly ethical. However those who went on the tour came back with very positive reviews of the tour company, the experience and the benefit to the locals, which in turn made me regret not visiting.

After surprisingly minimal spending in surprisingly cheap Rajasthan, Mumbai turned out to be a very expensive few days what with the purchase of my net book, extra nights accommodation, airport taxi’s and flight to Goa. We also ate out on one evening by accident at Indigo one of Mumbai’s best (and most expensive) restaurants. I say accidentally as we had been planning to visit a restaurant with the same name but considerably cheaper prices. It was however a very nice accident in the end as the food was superb, I ate a wonderfully rich and creamy lobster bisque, a fancy beef steak (yes I did say beef!), oxtail and pumpkin main and a gooey chocolate lovely thing for desert, we also enjoyed an endless supply of bread and roles as well as those free little mini snacks you get in between dishes (you know you’re in a posh restaurant when they give you free food!). The meal cost about 25 GBP, expensive by local standards but cheap by western standards considering the quality which I would say (given my expert opinion) was not far off Michelin Standard. Leaving Mumbai I took a taxi to the airport, I’m sure I overpaid but at the equivalent of 5 GBP for about a one hour journey I didn’t feel too hard done by.

Elephanta Island
From a distance, with a bit of squinting, it could look like an elephant.
Our last day started with my last dosa (thin, crepe-like) with curried potatoes, which I only just learned is called masala potatoes. It also came with a vegetable gravy. I will miss this breakfast. Plus I had smoked salmon and half a bagel – can’t pass that up.

We walked across the street to the Gateway of India. L__ wanted us to hustle but even she couldn’t resist another picture. I got some good ones of the gate and the Taj, both Palace and Tower.

Past the Gateway was the jetty for tour boats. L__ rented one boat for our group alone, to be able to control the timing of our leaving (before too many other tourists arrived) and returning (in time for our lunch reservation). Our destination was Elephanta Island and the temple caves.

The way out there was disgracefully smoggy – even with handkerchief over my nose and mouth I could smell and taste the burnt petroleum (and probably cow dung if I knew what that tasted like!). On the way were the navel base and the petroleum docks and pipeline to the mainland. Everything shrouded in smog.

The cave we visited (main and most carved
Elephanta Caves
Incredibly these caves were expanded and carved from rock.
one) was not entirely a natural one but a sort-of building carved and hollowed out from the stone of the large hill that forms the island. Giant pillars front the cave. Our guide took us into the pillared cave space and showed us each of the story panels involving Shiva. The carvings are in bad shape because first the Portuguese and then the British shot at them for amusement. All the original coating of “plaster” and paint is gone, except for a tiny amount in the corner of one ceiling – which I couldn’t really see. The lighting is all natural from the opening of the cave – often too dark for my camera to register a focus.

The way up and down from the caves was on a stone-built walkway with 120 steps. All along, on both sides, were vendors of souvenirs, trinkets, fake jewelry, etc. They begged us to buy but none of it inspired me.

Returning to Mumbai, we walked a few blocks to a “stir-fry restaurant”, similar to the Mongolian Grill in Calgary: the customer puts an assortment of vegetables and meats in a bowl; the cooks stir fry it in the flavourings of
Marriage of Shiva & Parvati
Several of the carved scenes were of the marriage of these two favourite gods.
one’s choice. Usually I don’t select well but the combination of cooked lamb and quite a few vegetables with sweet chili sauce was good – and hot!

Some opted to go look at Leopold’s, a café bombed in 2004, but I was tired and returned to the Taj for a rest. Shortly after 3:00 I went to check out the shops and rapidly fell into temptation, buying two silk scarves that added up to more than my remaining rupees - but that’s what credit cards are for. I also bought three little cookbooks, anticipating this year’s Christmas gifts.

Then time for a swim and lounging. A murder of crows lives on the window ledges of the hotel, and in the late afternoon (maybe other times also) kites circle high above the pool, sending the crows into a wheeling flock seeking a resting place. The U-shaped building, with the pool in the centre, makes all this a unique environment for the birds.

After a delicious Middle Eastern dinner in a restaurant at the top of the Taj Tower, we had a brief rest and checked out at 11:00 pm. The return trip to the airport, this time in the dark,
Taj Mahal Palace
A delightful way of spending an hour in the afternoon.
was instructive. Surprisingly, the daytime dark corridors of the slums were well lit by electricity now. Small groups of people or individuals and a few families were sleeping on the street. The street-side slum dwellings are tarpaulin-based tents. (Where do they get them from – most of them are the same colour?) And along Marine Drive walk, almost as many people were relaxing and strolling as during the day. 24-hour Mumbai.

Our entry into the airport building was insane. Many flights leave in the very early morning, presumably to arrive at European destinations at the beginning of the workday there or to connect to more reasonably scheduled European flights, as we were doing. A huge crowd hovered outside the single doorway open into the building, because of security checks for every person. The human process was push or be stranded, all with trolleys laden with bags, of course.

Once in, the way to the check-in gate was ordinary enough. However, L__ was very annoyed that all our seat reservations (aisle and window with no one in the middle) had been cancelled. She had quite a ferocious argument with the check-in staff member until we were all accommodated somehow.
Artwork
In the vast hotel lobby were strange and beautiful artworks.
Then, the staff member weighed both her checked bag and her hand luggage, and declared the latter very overweight (perhaps because she had a big binder of papers regarding our trip). L__ started frantically passing all kinds of items to M__ who held them in her arms looking a bit stunned. I immediately opened my relatively light carry-on for the items. Shaken but upright, the staff member weighed my checked bag (right on the allowed 50 pounds, as weighed in my hotel room with my new scale), but not my carry-on. Either she saw it was fairly empty or she decided on discretion. We all knew everything would go back into L__’s bag soon.

Now there were a couple of hours waiting near the gate, with a bit of wandering around. I couldn’t quite spend all my rupees, although I did enjoy an orange soft drink. Of course, they called the flight before I finished it, but there was plenty of time waiting in the line for the plane. Other people kept walking past us as if they were first class, although the first class seats could not have been plentiful enough for them. The plane was absolutely full,
Memorial

and I think what happened was the flight was almost commandeered by the international banking delegates returning home. My indifference was complete because my seat happened to be in an odd spot, not quite in the back, where the plane’s shape gave me extra room on one side.

Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus
The great train station seething with people and machines.
Today the first part of our tour was on the bus, trying to see the historic buildings from British times through the windows. The sun was almost always in the wrong position to take photos, and we could only see bits of the buildings. Frustrating, even though our guide was knowledgeable and interesting in how she introduced the sites and their architecture. Most significant was the last cast-iron buildingin Mumbai – the hotel that refused entry to the “original” Mr Tata, Mumbai businessman, because he was Indian. He got his revenge by opening the Taj Mahal Palace, open to all. Six rupees per room then.

Our first stop was at a Jain temple. This one was quite new, with part still under construction. A few weeks ago the historic temple was closed to tourists, because a group from a cruise boat severely disrespected the rules by wearing their shoes and dressing poorly. Not everything has to be old, however. This temple was beautiful: intricate lace-work carving and statues in peaceful white stone. We did later see the old temple from the bus; it was colourfully painted as perhaps this one will be one day.

From the temple entryway, we turned left
Jain Temple
Modern carvings in the ancient tradition
into a large courtyard-type room, where the wall on our left was filled with small statues of gods; a worshipper had a small, round tray with sandalwood paste and marigold flowers. She carefully but quickly adorned points on each statue, such as forehead and belly, in an obviously long practiced ritual. We moved on to an altar, a smaller room, where circumambulation was the ritual (from left to right), which we joined for one circle. We continued on past the main altar room which we did not enter but which contained a very large statue. We turned back and in a second part of the courtyard room we admired the rice grain mandalas. By this time the same worshiping woman was pouring out some grains of rice to make her own.

Our next stop on the bus was at the former home of Mahatma Gandhi, a museum now. His room and balcony from which he spoke and where he met friends and dignitaries are set up as they once were, now protected by glass. We saw the spinning wheel and simple mat. On another floor, about 20 small dioramas, painstakingly made with five-inch dolls, told the story of his
Hanging Gardens
Beautiful gardens but they don't hang down as I had always imagined!
life. Although I knew the story, I was moved by the reverential tone of the guide’s voice even while she repeated what she must have said so often in her seven-year career. On the main floor was a library with mounted photographs and important letters, such as two from Tolstoy and one from Einstein.

At the next stop I had a surprise: the famous Hanging Gardens don’t hang: it is a nice but perfectly normal park built over a huge reservoir. I was so surprised I didn’t absorb why they are called such (a job for Google). They do represent an extraordinarily peaceful green-space in this crowded city (20 million population). From the Gardens we could see the Greco-style apartment of the sprawling Kingfisher business empire, and the top of the “apartment” of the world’s second richest man. (Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Reliance Industries: the rich list and his position on it vary annually.) This is a building for five residents and 600 staff with parking for 120! Three helipads are probably necessary to avoid traffic and kidnapping plots. One of our earlier guides said that India has all the money it needs to solve all its problems, if it had
Dhobi Ghat
Famous outdoor laundry that staggers the imagination
the will. He also said the hugely influential Tata family devotes one third of its income to charitable works, so they don’t place as high on the rich list as they might.

Many Indians are hard-working; our next stop was at the other end of the income scale. The outdoor laundry called the Dhobi Ghat is almost beyond comprehension. From the vantage point of an overpass we watched hundreds of men washing and hanging clothes in cement or stone short cubicles. Under the shade of a tarpaulin others were ironing. Untold pieces of clothing, including hospital and hotel uniforms, are laundered every day and returned to the rightful owners without error. JK told us that business schools study this to try to understand the accuracy of the processes. Earlier our guide told a similar story of the tiffin-wallahs who pick up, deliver, and return innumerable tiffin boxes within 15 minutes of the recipients’ lunch times.

Our final stop was the former Prince of Wales Museum. Unfortunately we were tired and dazed by this time. I took the audio guide in an effort to concentrate on the ancient statues, mainly of Shiva and Ganesha. I concentrated so hard that M__ had to remind
Marine Drive
A favourite place for walking, day or night
me of and take me to Parvati slaying a demon in the guise of a buffalo – a more modern, large, passionate work full of intricate embellishments.

I was certainly in need of lunch, which was a buffet in a modern restaurant. Tasty as always. Quite a few restaurants have stairs with no railings, quite scary! At this one, we climbed the stairs up and down to the buffet.

We were back at the hotel around 3:00. Just in time to have a quick rest, in my case have a quick swim, and be ready for a tour of the Taj put on by the hotel. A word about the swim – one wears street clothes in the lobby – not the main lobby but the somewhat more intimate Palace lobby. One goes by the pool down some stairs to the spa, where on this day several gentle-voice young ladies (Filipina?) gently show one to the lockers and changing room. When changed, one goes up to the long pool (that provides the best view of the hotel - must bring camera next time). A young man shows one to a lounge chair, whips a pool towel onto the
Murals
Loved the murals made on what we call sound barriers
chair and proffers a small bottle of water. Luxurious!

The hotel’s history is probably even more colourful than the summary provided by the lively guide (duty manager for this day). We started in the pool area, which used to be the main entrance where carriages drove up – he had historic photos to illustrate his talk. With great aplomb and charming knowledge, he recited a list of visitors that matched the nationalities of the people on the tour, plus the big celebrities. Apparently Stephen Harper never stayed, but the guide had us all laughing over his confusion in trying to pronounce Saskatchewan regarding Brad Wall’s stay. In a most discrete and respectful way he mentioned both changes and restorations after “the attacks” (his word), without actually dwelling on the event itself. The ballroom was completely destroyed and restored, and on this day was decorated with masses of red roses for international bankers who were meeting there. (Near the ballroom was a window that gave a perfect photo of the Gateway of India.) Over the years Tata acquired adjacent land and built the tower part of the hotel, where we were to have stayed. Much better in the historic part, which has

been fully restored since the fires of the attacks – the style of the old with all the latest modern conveniences. Our tour ended in the Palace tearoom where we were invited to have coffee, tea or Indian sparkling wine. T__, L__ and I had wine and chatted with the guide for some time. (He circulated to all the tables.) The tour is designed to make the guest’s stay at the Taj and “experience” not a “transaction”. Success!

Our farewell dinner was this night. We had all been advised to buy small gifts for a gift exchange. In one corner of the not busy dining room (too early) we chuckled and traded.

Mumbai street shopping
A string of Canadians was a definite oddity to the sophisticated Mumbai shoppers.
We had a late start: only a one-hour drive to the airport and an uneventful flight. Our arrival at the very modern Mumbai airport was also easy.

On the road I was in for a shock! The pollution here is multiple times worse than in the other parts of India we have visited, although smog is persistent all over. We drove for a while through congested traffic. Near the airport are the infamous slums, which I photographed from the air – just like in Slum Dog Millionaire. The colour is deep brown and no light seems to penetrate the covered corridors. Considering the monsoons, having contiguous cover doesn’t seem unreasonable. The huts occupy roadsides and any “spare” land; but, away from the airport there are virtually no slums on our route. Buildings are of all qualities neighbouring each other. Later we were told that some are traditional small coop apartment buildings that are disintegrating while owners save to buy something better. Laundry hangs almost anywhere.

At one point L__ and the guide came to an agreement to enable her and J__ to visit a costume jewelry store they liked from before. The rest of us jumped down for the adventure. We
Art Deco
Many lovely Art Deco style buildings in Mumbai, my favourite style
walked for about five minutes (me wearing handkerchief over my nose and mouth) trying to hug the edge of the road even as we walked past parked taxis and motorcycles. The store itself was beautiful, full of sparkly bracelets, earrings, and necklaces. Many Indian women were shopping, one purchasing a veil with sparkly edges, perhaps for her wedding considering all the other women helping her. When we returned to the bus, our travel time to the hotel had increased by sixty to ninety minutes because it was now rush hour.

The Taj Mahal Hotel is magnificent! We were upgraded to the Palace – the services and décor are completely over the top! Shown to our rooms, welcomed by a butler, and the room tidied for the evening by yet another man. (Wished they would go and let me have a nap.) Beautiful paintings on the walls, and in the lobby flower displays about 3 – 4 foot in diameter. The internal staircase is a work of art in marble, carpet and wrought iron. We met in the lobby to go out for dinner and watched the tight security: large bollards that rose and lowered at the entrance stopped cars. Cars had

Hotel of the most luxurious dreams!
to open their hoods and trunks, plus be examined underneath by a mirror.

Our bus waited on the street. Dinner was at the Kyber Restaurant, which serves north Indian food. It was a busy place, and thanks to the insistence of L__ and JK, we were in the midst of the hustle bustle, not relegated to a dining room in the back. The set menu was delicious and exceedingly plentiful.

Lunchtime!
Tiffin carriers!
Namaste!

As usual, I feel like I could take one day here and fill an entire blog with the minute details, the people I met and the things I saw, the food I ate and the sounds I heard, but in the interest of time (and in the interest of people ACTUALLY reading my blog and not falling asleep), I will try to provide a big overview of everything that happened while in Mumbai, another city that is on my “Favourites” list.

Mumbai began with a 24-hour train ride from Bangalore in Sleeper class, which is my personal favourite train class because you get to see so much more – and, obviously, we were a bit of a curiosity for some leering men, especially when we busted out the travel Scrabble board, but it was worth it as that ate up some of the time! We arrived first thing in the morning and grabbed a taxi who said he would use his meter to take us from the train station to the Salvation Army hostel (more on that later!) where we were staying, but we noticed after a while that the price wasn't increasing on the meter
WTF?!
This is officially the most pointless thing I have ever seen sold on the streets, ever - plus they were having some sort of turf dispute!
and we suspected that he was going to pull some excuses when we arrived to try to get us to pay a higher price – but magically, after we explained that we were only going to pay what the meter showed, the numbers began to change and we arrived for the right price – although he still whined at us that the money we had given him was torn and was trying to get us to pay more for our luggage. We left him complaining in the street and went up to the lunch room in the hostel where we waited for a room to vacate before we crashed out on beds that were, literally, crawling with baby cockroaches (babies, so it wasn't so bad!). I had convinced Mom that if we scrimped a little on accommodation in Mumbai (which is notoriously expensive) that we could spend more on really good food (which we love).

I later got hit by a taxi, which is of course not at all surprising, but not very hard and since I didn't have dengue this time it hurt an awful lot less! Really it was just a bump but the driver seemed
Tea at the Taj!
A highlight, for certain :)
to think it was hysterical (I did NOT think this), and later that day I met a man who had really been hit badly by a cab and then had been left for dead (he had a couple broken bones), so it could have been a lot worse and I am grateful it wasn't! We spent the first day just wandering around and looking at all the beautiful, Gothic, ageing and weathered buildings in Colaba and Fort, the area of the city where we were staying, visiting art galleries and people-watching which is so easy to do there! Mumbai is an amazing place, I don't know why it gets such a bad rap – it's got this amazing combination of the hectic traffic, the delicious street food, the hawkers selling useless trinkets (really, really useless – what am I supposed to do with an enormous phallic-shaped balloon? Actually don't answer that...), the people scrambling to take our photos (the highlight was two business men who took a photo with each of us, giving us a two-handed handshake as if meeting dignitaries), the classy people walking in and out of the Taj Hotel... I mean I could go on, but I

Mom re-packing the leftover bread from the breadbasket we snuck out of the restaurant at breakfast!
feel like there is always, always something to look at, as there is in every city in this country, but Mumbai just has this different energy about it – hard to explain!

The next day was a really, really amazing one – for no other reason than that we went for high tea at the Taj Hotel. The Taj was built when J.N. Tata, a big name in Indian business, was refused entry to what was at that time the most opulent and prestigious hotel in the city, Watson's, because he was not white. He decided to build his own luxury hotel, and it has become as much a symbol of the city as the Gateway of India right next to it. So being able to visit the hotel (which I did not do last time, due to being a REALLY grimy backpacker) with Mom was something pretty cool, and sitting in the sea lounge, wearing a dress that bared my knees (which I had not done yet in India – I pretty much felt naked!) sipping the house blend of Darjeeling tea and eating scones (hahahaha) was pretty cool – of course there was a part of
Mumbai harbour view
Props to J.N. Tata!
me that felt completely out of place, being waited on and eating with fancy china and cutlery, but I also felt really lucky to be able to do something so special and once-in-a-lifetime with Mom – that is pretty much what this whole trip is about, is being able to do things that at home we never would and being able to do it together, strengthening the relationship we have with each other, and I cannot even begin to express how much it means to me that we can share things like this.

So, with tea over, and stuffed to the brim with delicious tea goodies (yes, I was wearing a fancy dress, but that did not stop me from indulging myself at the buffet – you can take the backpack OFF the girl, but when it comes to eating out and making the most of my dollars you cannot take the backpacker OUT of the girl!), we returned to the hotel where I was reminded that even though we're more friends than mother/daughter now, Mom is still Mom! I met some guys who invited me to go grab a beer with them and got the usual “Where
Elephanta
Stunning cave temple carvings
are you going, who are you going with, when will you be back?” that I have been getting my entire life – definitely different from travelling by myself where I don't have to tell anyone anything! Not that I am complaining, at all, it is nice to know she cares 😊

The following day I got to go back to Bollywood, and yes I am aware of both how absurd and how fortunate I am that I am able to say “back” to Bollywood, but unfortunately this experience wasn't as positive as the last one. A group of us got picked up by a really small van, driven up to the far north of Mumbai to this old sort of crumbling house and packed into a really tiny trailer (this isn't the bad part yet). We got fed a bit of lunch and then the wardrobe department arrived to give us our clothes for the shoot. We'd been told at our hostel to wear Western clothes because we were going to be extras in a party scene in the background, so we did, but when we arrived apparently there had been a “miscommunication” and what they brought out
Bollywood, again
One of the perks - you get to play with unloaded, but still functional, lethal weapons!
for us to wear covered a little less than what my bathing suit covers – seriously. We were now supposed to be a bunch of girls hanging around a gangster and his buddies, fawning over them and flirting with them, which was still ok at this point even though it wasn't exactly what I signed up for and some alarm bells were starting to go off. So we put on the outfits and went to meet the director, who after seeing us apparently changed his mind again, and decided that he wanted us to be lap dancing and kissing the actors. I don't think there was any miscommunication at all – I'm pretty sure if someone went wandering around Mumbai asking girls to put on lingerie and mack a bunch of guys on camera, the answer would be a big huge NO, so they need to make it sound better than it actually is.

It was here that I (and the other 3 girls I was with) drew the line. I have been fighting the image of the Western girl as a slut since I started coming to India, because unfortunately due to cultural differences and due to
Straight chilling
I think we all feel like this from time to time :)
the way Bollywood uses Western women, Indians (and many Indian men specifically) have this idea that we are all easy and all go around having sex with whoever crosses our path and that obviously we don't mind being groped, fondled and grabbed whenever we go out, because that is just how we are. I get where it comes from, and I am certainly not ok with it, and have no problem punching or slapping any man who touches me in an inappropriate way (which I have had to do more than once), but I get it. But to be asked to perpetuate this stereotype was NOT something I was going to be doing, and I let the production team know that, and when I (and the other girls) refused the director started to get really condescending, saying that it was no big deal, that he knows that we do stuff like this all the time, etc... and trying to guilt us into doing what he wanted. When we started talking about walking out (or getting paid much more than 500 rupees for our time), they magically found more clothes for us to wear and other things for us to be
More caves
Tears were just sort of constantly running down my face at this point - so lame!
doing, like working at a casino and selling guns to the gangsters.

So it ended on a better note than it began, and you can now officially catch me in Sanjay Dutt's next movie (I forget what it's called, but it starts with a “D”), but it really highlighted to me the main (and pretty much only) struggle that I have faced since coming here. I don't want to whine or complain, because I certainly am very privileged and blessed to be travelling here, and to have been travelling here by myself, since it has opened doors for me that I wouldn't have if I were with a partner, but it has left me a bit vulnerable at times to that small minority of people who disrespect women and who pick on me because I am a Western woman, which to them represents someone with loose morals. I am happy though that I took a stand and refused to be cast into the stereotype of the “Western slut” and hopefully this will serve as an example in the future for the misogynistic director. Hopefully.

The next day we decided to be tourists and go out to Elephanta Island, which is about an hour's boat ride out of Mumbai harbour and holds ancient Hindu temple carvings from the 8th century (or thereabouts). It was pretty similar to the cave temples at Ellora that I got to see last time I was here, carved out of solid rock and incredibly intricate, and we had a great guide (it is nice having a guide at places like this, but I swear, if I hear the story one more time about how Ganesh got his head I will be able to give the tour myself!) who explained all the different panels. After the tour I wandered down to a tiny cave by myself where there was a single Shiva lingam in the centre, with a few yellow flowers placed around it and no one else around, and that thing happened to me again that I get sometimes here where I just started to cry, being really overwhelmed by this feeling of being (for lack of a better word) homesick for a time, not a place, and not something that I have a conscious awareness of, just something inside of me that yearns for something past. It's hard to describe, but it happens often when I hear live tabla music, it happened in Udaipur last time I was here when the elderly devotees invited me to sit with them while they were chanting in worship, and it happened on Elephanta Island so that all I could do was just drop to my knees in front of this shrine and sob, not in a sad way, but in a very peaceful, joyful and overwhelming way; that's the only way I can describe it.

As I left I noticed an old man sitting in a corner, wearing glasses and barefoot, who smiled at me as I collected myself, a little embarrassed that I wasn't alone after all and had been caught having a really emotional and personal moment. He nodded at me and said “It is peaceful, no?” and I nodded back at him and said that yes, it was. His smile grew wider and he said “God bless you”.



And that was all.



As usual, much much love and peace from Hindustan!



Xoxoxo

I arrive in Mumbai and the first thing I notice is the abundance of kites in the sky! The 15th January is a National Kite Festival across the whole of India and what a spectacle! Swarms of children & adults alike cover rooftops and parks and the sky is filled with bright paper planes.

I arrive at my guesthouse to find it's not exactly in the busy central location it had made out in the Lonely Planet book, but only 50rupees in a taxi down the road from India Gate, it could be worse. I have a walk around the Cordoba area but soon tire of the Market traders selling more shit i don't want... Especially the guy who follows me for about a mile down the road banging a small drum ""madam you want drum, verrrry cheeeeap""... I don't care how cheap, I wouldn't want it if you paid me... In fact I would have paid him just to get him out my face, the persistent bugger, except I wasn't gonna break into a 500 note...

I grab another taxi, in the form of an old Trabant. Mumbai is full of them, in their signature yellow & black,
Sunset at Chowpatty
and they are all decorated differently inside from ornate carpets to full on animal or 60s psychedelic. Tuk tuks aren't allowed in this part of the city, but the old cars add a certain retro style to the city that I haven't seen elswhere in India. Of course this is the home of Bollywood and the city where dreams are made!

Walking past all the 5 star beautiful hotels on the harbour I have my first moment of weakness and think about saying sod it and treating myself to a slap up meal at the Taj, but a little voice inside me is screaming ""What would Michael Palin do?"" so I head to Chowpatty beach for sunset and am greeted by a million kite runners - the beach is packed! The atmosphere is alive with thousands of families enjoying the kite festival and street food stalls aplenty coaxing in hungry punters with delicious spicy smells. I am indeed one of these hungry punters and opt for Behl Puri and Veg Pavi - 2 dishes famous to Mumbai, no idea what they are really but very yummy! Washed down with a fruity Falooda (kind of Kulfi icecream milkshake - mainly
Kite Flying
ordered cos I thought the name sounded a bit rude!)

The next day I take a tour of the city, starting with the richer part of Mumbai, Malabar Hills. I have a wander around the hanging gardens and visit a Parsi temple, which immediately makes me giggle as the sign on the front reads: Rules - 1. Remove footwear. 2. No food or drink. 3. Women on their monthly period not allowed. Well thankfully I'm not, but I'm hoping they don't do routine checks!! I've read a lot about various religions not allowing women near places of worship while they are on their ""menstrual cycle"" as apparently we give off a ""poisonous aura"" - and more shockingly, in Nepal the tradition of the woman being ""banished to the cow shed"" for 4-7 days once a month was only abolished in 2005!! I kid you not!!

Parsi's live in this up town area of Mumbai and my guide shows me an area behind one of their mansions where their dead are put into shallow wells for the vultures to feed on, as part of their religion. Luckily we're not close enough to see! I've leant a lot about religion
Chowpatty Beach at Night
during the last 3 weeks in India and found it all truly fascinating. Though if I had the choice I would definitely opt for being burnt over hot coals in Varanasi than left out for the Vultures to peck at me!

I visit Gandhi's house before lunch and then head into Dhavari - India's largest slum area and home to 1 million people. I have to say I am pleasantly suprised to realise that it is a town in it's own right... Bustling with shops, garages, street food sellers etc. Of course it is very poor and living conditions as you would expect, from seeing ""Slumdog Millionaire"" - this is where much of it was filmed, but everyone is getting on with day to day lives, earning a living.

There is a man sorting plastics into colours, I'm not sure what for but I can't help but think about the rest of India having rubbish strewn about the place but in the slums there seems to be a place for everything. One man has a shop of old oil cans, another old washing machines, another the tape that comes from inside casettes. Again I don't know what they
The Old Trabants
are for but they must have a use! Maybe there is someone out the back doing make-shift Bollywood movies...

I chat to two young boys who are practising their English - ""hellooo madam, what is your name?"" ""you take photo?"" - they both pose for the camera and I show them the image on screen and they giggle. I have become used to this while travelling across India... Those that have cameras are constantly snapping away and those who are bit cocky will ask for a photo with you. I had a rather intense moment outside India Gate as I sat on the harbourside reading my book in the sunshine; quite chilled and relaxed, all of a sudden there's a large group of people round me, ""photo photo madam, can we have one photo?""... Before I know it they are all taking turns, one in, one out as their friends snap away... Boys, girls, whole families waiting in line to have a photo with the white blonde girl. Everyone is very friendly and I'm amused by the hilarity of the situation, but after a while it just starts to piss me off so I duck into a cafe to
CST - Main Terminal
get some peace and quiet...

My third and final day in Mumbai I meet up with Vanessa & Rod, 2 friends from work who are out visiting factories in Mumbai. We have lunch at the beautiful ""Cafe by the Beach"" under lush palm trees, it's a little oasis in the midst of the busy dusty streets, and finally a bit of western food (my first for 3 weeks!) in the form of a goats cheese salad wrap! Mmm... We then head to India Gate and have a boat trip around the harbour... it does make me chuckle the way they charge an extra 10 rupees to sit on top - and of course the top is full of Brits all trying to catch that precious piece of sunshine! We also didn't let the stereotype down!

A third and final dinner at the food stalls on Chowpatty beach and Vanessa is as into it as I am, trying a bit of everything! I think this must be my cheapest but most favourite meal of the trip so far!

An early night before my early morning flight sees my final day in India draw to an end...

Despite
Street Food on Chowpatty Beach
all the frustrations I've had over the past few weeks, I can't help but have a place in my heart for this special country. It's a land of extreme contrasts; rich & poor, calm & chaos, smells that slap you in the face with either disgust or delight, the most delicious food cooked in the most dirtiest of kitchens, sights that have made me laugh or want to cry. I've been in awe of both spectacular beauty and pure poverty within seconds, such welcoming friendly, caring people and then those that just want to rip you off... It all makes India the wonderland that it is! I hate India & I love India all at the same time.

And I can't help but wish I had longer here, there's still so much I still want to see and do in this country, but for now Tina International is checking out...So long for now India! But something tells me I'm not done with you yet!

Xx

A city of contrasts. Skyscrapers stand next to stately Victorian buildings. Slums scattered throughout the city providing homes for many.The law of the jungle prevails when it comes to traffic control with the horn being the most vital piece of equipment required. Everywhere is busy and hectic and yet despite what appears to be organised chaos the city is at the heart of the drive forward by India. Tomorrow we retreat from this hive of activity and head for Kerala

Second update from the land of diversity.

Some new discoveries:

- we love ladoos (Indian sweets, the ones we love with Sesame)

- too short jeans shorts and hole in 'the area of the bootay' might be fround upon (at least it attracts some intrigued eyes)
- argue with taxi driver over 10 Rs (= 14 cents) might not be worth the trouble (especially not in unknown dodgy area)

- Chalo is the best word ever.

- love the areas Colaba, Churchgate, Fort, Bandra, Kalbadevi and Kala Ghala.



Since our last entry we've basically had an overdose of impressions. On Saturday we had a full day of guided tours, first in Mumbai in the morning, and then on Elephanta Island in the afternoon. On our city tour we had an amazing guide called Dilip who was great at answering all our 1000 questions. What we saw was everything from Malabar Hills, a very rich area where the governor of Maharashtra lives, among other politicians and rich people, to the beautiful ocean view from Marine Drive, to the Hanging Gardens and the Tower of Silence and so on and so on.. One thing which we especially noticed was the overwhelming impact which the British had when India was under British rule. Signs, buildings, left-sided traffic, street and house names, a lot of them based on the influence of the British.

After our amazing tour which lasted for 3 hours we arrived at the Gateway of India, where we took a boat to Elephanta Island, a one-hour trip from Mumbai. When we arrived we were immediately approached by the sweetest local (whos name we CANNOT spell btw) who took us for a tour around the island. The island has approx. 1 500 inhabitants, generally living of tourism in different forms. Not included in the 1 500 inhabitants are the monkeys, cows, goats, dogs etc etc etc walking around, some more aggressive than other (Catharina said ""Na du Fetti"" (What's up fatty) to one of the cows which got VERY upset with her, to say the least..) Except wandering around in the mesmerizing Elephanta Caves, which unfortunately were destroyed by the British (or was it the Portuguese?), we saw monkeys doing some serious product placement drinking Fanta and Sprite while chilling in a tree, we learned some new words in Hindi - our favourite one being ""Chalo"" (='Let's go'😉, and also helpful ones like ""Namaste"" (mostly meaning Hello, but used for Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening too) and ""Dhanyavaad"" meaning 'thank you'. Leaving Elephanta Island we saw the most amazing sunset (yes yes - pics will be here shortly) - what an amazing way to finish an amazing day!

Not over yet though. As the naive Europeans that we are, we figured that we would arrive at the Gateway of India where we departed from. This was not the case. We arrived in something which looked like a warehouse for boats, PRETTY far away from Colaba where we are staying...! It was completely dark and the cabs that we could see were rapidly taken by other boat passengers going towards Mumbai. We found one available taxi where the driver agreed on 60 Rs to Colaba, but wanted to make a stop at a Kashmir store on the way. And, based on the heads-up which we had gotten from our lovely local (whos name we still cannot spell) who said that the cab drivers are going to rip us off when we get to Mumbai - we said:

- 'No No No Mister - 60 Rs directly to Colaba'.

(My, are we good negotiators or what!)

- 'Ok, but then 300 Rs, non-stop.'

This was not a deal which we would want to settle for. So we decided to start walking... The further we got, the lesser the people and the more the unbelievable smell of garbage, urine and everything else under that category. And this in complete darkness. We pretty soon understood that we're not in the greatest area to be in when it's dark and there not are that many people around.
Soon we got to a security booth, who helped us to stop a bus which was passing by which took us to the nearest main road. From there we took a taxi towards Colaba, all good - so we thought. After having a pretty uncomfortable dispute with the taxi driver over 10 Rs - we dropped our ""good negotiators'-act and agreed on the price, arriving in Colaba - happy to go to bed.

Today we were in a different area of Mumbai, close to Khar Road, in the Bandra district. We absolutely loved the atmosphere, but were somehow so tired that we basically just asked a Ricksaw driver to take us to the nearest cafe on Linking Road (a big shopping street) where we stayed all afternoon, reading and drinking water.

Tomorrow we are continuing our journey towards the City of Light - Varanasi. We are going to travel by train for 30 hours, so we believe that we will have some interesting stories when we get access to Internet again. We are very excited about our upcoming journey and stay in Varanasi - so stay tuned.

Love - A & C

So we're alive. After a long trip with several discoveries:

1. LDN Heathrow has some happy mice who live in a hole under one of the carpets in Cafe Nero, terminal 4.

2. Sleeping in a nursery room is better than sleeping in the same hall as mice.
3. We love Air India. Just LOVE Air India.
4. Not everyone is trying to rip you off, but yes, most people do have a second agenda.



... we finally arrived in Mumbai late at night, January 11th. We'd already booked a hotel for the night, which they had let go (and now they were fully booked of course), so we just took the first best thing we heard of. This turned out to be a very expensive solution to our problem. Of course we tried to negotiate, but to be honest, we did not have a clue of what we were negotiating about. Funfun, we took the insanely expensive room (4500Rs = approx. 65 EUR - NOT WORTH IT), got a fun breakfast of white toast (toasted or non-toasted) and coffee basically made out of sugar. After that we took a Rickshaw (a TukTuk for the ones who have been in Thailand) to the nearest train station in Andheri where we took the train towards Churchgate where we had found a hostel which we wanted to stay in (Hotel Lawrence). Going by train was really comfortable, we went with train (felt more like a S-Bahn/Metro) for more than 1 1/2, but it was fine. The doors were wide open and people were leaning out of them and yellling something to people passing by. We passed several different areas, some more well-preserved and some not, for instance Dharavi - one of the largest slums in the world.

We arrived in Churchgate and walked to Hotel Lawrence where we wanted to stay. Of course it was fully booked (note to self - book everything in advance) but the manager was so kind to call another hotel closeby, Sea Shore Hotel, were we're staying now. We've just been walking around so far, still a bit jetlaged, exploring Colaba which is the area where our hotel is, and today we're going to Fort and Churchgate to explore some more. General impressions so far are that people are very friendly and service-minded, the men wear shirts tucked into their pants and most women wear the most amazing saris. There are a lot of people with iPhones, insanely large cars and other modern equipment, but also a lot of poor people, especially children. A lot of buildings are absolutely amazing, most of them in bad condition though. Traffic.. well, insane - our trick to not get run over is to follow the Indians when they are crossing the road - traffic lights are not always to be trusted.

Tomorrow we will go to Elephanta Island, an island outside of Mumbai which is suppose to be amazing, and in the afternoon we might meet up with a friend of a friend of Anna's, Karan (AIESECer of course) who will show us around Bandra (part of Mumbai). The weather is warm but the humidity is not too bad - we're truely enjoying our stay! In a few days we'll start our journey up north - so more exciting things ahead.



Pictures will be uploaded when we've actually taken some.



Hugs / A&C

06/01/12

Ok so I arrived in Mumbai yesterday around 2am after three flights and about 32hours of travelling. It was pretty harrowing leaving the airport laden with heavy bags and a severe lack of sleep and walking out into hundreds of faces all staring back at me, brandishing signs for local taxi companies and hotels. I scanned the crowd for a board with my name on it but could not see it anywhere. I was exhausted so I sat in the midst of it for ten minutes or so and attempted to gather myself. I took another walk around and found a young indian guy wearing a black and green checked shirt, who held a sign with something similar to my name on it. 'Lauren Huges' and Anjali Inn were printing on the board. I followed him towards the carpark.



Along the way he put me on the phone with the hostel owner. In my delirium I thought he had said that he was sending me to stay at his sisters house as there was no room at the Anjali. I found out later that he had actually said his 'sister hotel', owned by his close friend. We pulled up after a short ride through ramshackle streets and the driver took me into the hotel. The entrance for which was down a decidedly suspect looking alleyway surrounded by a dozen or so men, seemingly just hanging around. In all seriousness it could easily have been a dangerous situation that I was walking into but in the absence of sleep I didn't take it in until the following morning.



I'd like to say that I slept well but in truth I was awoken early the following morning by loud banging in the hotel. It seems it is usual to work through the night over here. Once I had stirred, even through my thick earplugs the sound of the traffic outside started to drift into my consciousness. Constant horn honking seems to be the noise that best describes the 'sound of India'. I was told I would be collected from here in the morning and taken to the Anjali for my second nights stay. I waited 10mins Indian time, ergo 1hour 20mins Rest of the World time for the taxi to arrive. Two girls from Canada sat next to me and we got chatting. It turned out that they too had been bumped the previous night and were heading over to the Anjali with me. They were Claire and Rebecca and had just finished Uni. India was their first stop and they were heading on to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam after this (all places I would love to visit).



We hooked up later and headed into Colaba. We approached a rickshaw driver asking if he could take us there but he laughed and just shoed away saying 'taxi, taxi'. Just over an hour later, still in the taxi, we realised why he didn't want to take us. We were all expecting a 20minute ride but all underestimated just how huge Mumbai is. The drive there was an experience, to say the least. The three of us just about crammed into the back of the taxi which was probably for the best as it had no seatbelts so we were relying on the 'sardines in a tin can' method of staying alive in the event of a collision. Now I'm not sure if Indian driving is just plain madness and chaos or absolute genius. Their spacial awareness and gaul is constantly challenged as they somehow manage to squeeze 6-7 cars side by side across a three lane road. The traffic seems completely out of control and it's every man for himself but somehow it seems to work. There is a hierarchy on Indian roads and it became quickly obvious that the bigger the better. The poor pedestrians literally have to run for their lives when crossing the road. Although there are some that strut across as if there wasn't around twenty rickshaws, motorcycles, taxis, buses and trucks making a B-line straight for them...which they are. Drivers intentionally speed up when a person makes the fatal decision to cross their path.



As soon as we arrived in Colaba, we went in search of food and happened upon a great place called Cafe Leopold. We were drawn in by the fantastic looking cakes on display in a counter facing the street. Apple pies and Belgian chocolate tarts. We were told the wait for a table would be 5minutes and I joked with the guy 'is that Indian time or normal time' to which he replied 'Indian time madam, Indians are always on time' and let out a huge belly laugh. But it turned out it really was 5minutes. I am ashamed to say that my first meal in india was not indian but was an all italian Penne Arrabiata and it was gooooooood!



We then headed out to find the Gateway of India which was beautiful. The scene, full of tourists, mainly Indian, was magical. We had arrived just as the sun was about to start making its way down so the dusty sky was illuminated with colour. The atmosphere was fantastic. We were stared at constantly and many people tried to take pictures of us and some even with us. As we stood admiring the monument an Indian man crept up to us and stood awkwardly next to us whilst his wife tried to take a picture. We spotted him and laughed and chose to pose in the picture with him. Then with his daughter and finally with his second daughter who was beautiful. She said thank you and welcome to India with a smile as her sister, taking the photograph, thanked us with a genuine indian head bobble.



We took a walk into town, I bought some art work from an Indian street seller on crutches. The work was his own and I admired him for doing what he could with his talent. I bought two paintings from him each for 200rupees, which is about £2.40 each he gave me two small pen and ink drawings and asked if I liked it here. I said yes as the people are so lovely. He smiled and told me this was a gift from India, not from him but from India. After a few hours in Colaba we decided to head back and tried to get a taxi but as soon as we said we were headed to Andheri, all the taxis just drove on. No one would take us. The panic set in but we met a very friendly taxi driver who was not able to take us but he chatted to a colleague who agreed for 400rupees. The drive was long and exhausting. We drove a very different way along the seafront and saw the richest parts of Mumbai but further into the journey came a stark contrast as we passed homes built of sticks and blankets on the side of busy freeways, inhabited by entire families. We saw children aged no more than five wandering the streets alone in the dark and wondered if they even had parents. It was soul destroying and I had to try to rationalise it to myself by accepting that this is a way of life for them, it's all they know. But I cannot accept that, I don't know how anyone can. I thought about my little brother, Sam who's six, and imagined it was him wandering these streets at night, alone, with no one to tell him that it was going to be ok, no one to feed him or comfort him and it was all I could do stop tears streaming down my face. This is a country of stark contrasts and I think the next three weeks is going to be a challenge.

We arrived in Mumbai in the evening on January 3rd after a short flight from Goa and headed outside to get a taxi, where the chaos and poverty of this huge city was evident straight away. It was dark by the time we got a taxi but we could clearly see the massive slums we were driving through, with people sleeping on the dirty streets, dogs and children sharing water, and people begging. Checking the taxi doors were locked, the driver slammed on the brakes when a fight broke out on the road in front of us and someone went flying across the bonet of the battered car. Sleepy Goa this was not.

We had underestimated the sheer size of Mumbai and almost 2 hours later finally arrived in South Mumbai in the Causeway area where out hotel was. Vic had booked this place for 2 nights online as it looked pretty ok, and hotels in Mumbai (even small 2* ones) were really expensive and there were not hostels to be found so got what we thought to be a good deal, although still not cheap at £50 a night, but on arrival to the 4th floor 'reception' in a
Photo 7
rickety old lift and being shown to our room we were left very dissapointed. The room was clean, but not very nice at all, really old fashioned with tiled floor, walls and ceiling, and looked nothing like the photos online so we asked if we could change rooms, but the manager said they were full that night and we would have to wait until tomorrow to change. Angry and feeling ripped off, we went in search for something to eat, but on leaving the hotel, realised that nothing was in walking distance so tried to get a taxi but the drivers didn't speak much English. We eventually got a driver who spoke English and asked him to take us to an area where there were some restaurants etc, and he took us to the Colaba area, probably where we should have stayed in the first place!

If we thought the men staring at Vic was bad in Goa, that was tame compared to Mumbai! We walked along a main street for a while lined with market type stalls looking for somewhere to eat and get our bearings. Feeling hot, tired, hungry, annoyed and uncomfortable in this busy and intimidating
Photo 3
looking city, we ducked into the first restaurant we saw and sat down to eat and try and work out on a map where we were. The place was busy which we took to be a good sign and we ordered some nice sounding food - a butter chicken for Vic and a lamb dish for Scott, but little did we know it was common for meat in curries to be on the bone, so we both picked at our bony food which wasn't very nice and soon left to get a cab back to the hotel..it's never great arriving somewhere unknown at night especially a huge city like Mumbai and we were both feeling pretty down and wishing we had stayed in Goa.

The next morning we woke up, got showered and dressed and worked out what we wanted to see and do that day, our only full day in Mumbai. It got off to a good start when the receptionist said we could move rooms and showed us to a brand new room which was lovely, just like the photos online! Feeling happier already, we left the hotel and stepped into the sunshine, which continued to brighten
Photo 25
our moods, and when Scott had a good coffee from a small place nearby, we were almost happy again. We started walking towards the Gateway of India, which is a big monument built during the British Raj in 1911, located on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. The monument was very impressive and almost looked a bit like a mini Taj Mahal. We took a few pictures there before going across to the famous Taj Mahal Palace, a huge 5* hotel which was attacked by terroists in 2008 but has since been restored. The hotel had very tight security and we had to go through an x ray machine and have our bags checked before going in, a result of the bombs in 2008. The hotel was very opulent and as we walked through the marbled lobby with the crystal chandeliers and uniformed staff, it felt a world away from the chaos and poverty that we had seen upon first entering Mumbai. We spent a while taking it all in, before leaving and deciding we needed to hire a driver for the day to take us to some of the sites further away.

We wondered around for a while
Photo 39
and had some lunch at McDonalds (yes we felt back but needed some western food!) but what a dissapointment - the cow is a holy animal in India people don't eat beef, therefor McDonalds only has chicken, veg or fish burgers! Serves us right really for steering away from such good Indian food. Then we went in search for a driver for the day and found Sammy, a real local Character named after Sammy Davis Jr from the Rat Pack he said (!), who had been bought up in Mumbai but had travelled and lived all over the world, could speak 5 languages including French, English & Spanish, and had a lively personality. We agreed a price of about £8 for him to drive us around to the main sites for the rest of the afternoon which seemed a great deal, until we got into his old battered car and experienced his 2 miles-per-hour driving and constant horn beeping! Anyway, first stop was the great Muhutma Ghandi's residence which was really interesting as it had been made into a museum and tribute to his life and good work, explaining everything about him and what he did for his country. After
Photo 8
an hour there, we were back in Sammy's 'car' and had a quick stop at Chowpatty beach, which was ok but the water didn't look very clean to swim in! Then we moved onto a park which we walked around for a while and as it was high up had great views across the city. After that it was onto Dhobi Ghat, the biggest open air laundry in Mumbai and maybe the world, where most of the cities big hotels send their washing to be done. This place was huge and it was mad to see all this washing in one area, it was a wonder anyone got the right laundry back there was so much of it! Then it was time to head back to the Causeway area where our hotel was, where we said goodbye to Sammy and watched the sunset over the bay, before going back to our room for a rest and to get ready for that evening.

We had read that there was an amazing food stall in the Colaba area which was really popular with locals that we wanted to find, so feeling a lot better about the city after a great day
Photo 5
out, we got a cab and told him to go to to the Colaba area. We had a nice walk around the area and felt much more comfortable than the previous night, although we couldn't find the food stall at first, but we carried on meandering through the little side streets for a while, before happening upon the stall in the distance. It was lit up and packed with people! It wasn't very big but there were people making the fresh chappati bread next to it and a few plastic tables & chairs to eat at which were all full, so we just ordered a chicken tikka wrap at first to try as a take away. OMG it was the yummiest wrap ever! We bith scoffed it down and decided we wanted to try some more of the food, so waited for a table to become free and sat down to order. We got another wrap, some more bread, a butter chicken and some vegetable side dish which we ate with our hands and were provided with a bowl of warm water to wash them in afterwards, great experience! Scott then wanted a beer and we remembered that in Goa
Photo 34
we had been told alcohol was expensive in India because it was taxed, they weren't wrong! Scott found a hole in the wall type place which sold bottled beer wrapped/hidden in paper bags, as we found out was actually illegal to drink on the streets in Mumbai, so we got a cab to a bakery we had passed earlier, got some cakes, and went back to our lovely room for a little feast of cake and beer which topped off a really enjoyable day & evening and left us liking Mumbai a lot!

The next day we checked out of the hotel, went for a coffee at a cute little place we found down the road, and walked towards the famous Chatrapati Shivaji train station, which was very impressive and a great example of the colonial style architechture which Mumbai is well known for. Along the way we passed some market stype stalls and lots of cats which of course Vic had to stop and talk to! The traffic around the train station was mad with tons of cars and bikes beaping their horns as it was on a busy junction and trains leave here to all over India,
Photo 17
but it was good to see and our last stop in Mumbai. We then headed back to the hotel to collect our bags and make our way to the airport to catch a flight to our last destination on this trip, Delhi and the famous Taj Mahal.

Mumbai left a really good impression on us and was somewhere we could have actually ended up staying for a few more days, as once we got over the initial culture shock of the poverty and the slums, it was a really vibrant city with great food and lots to see! Something that we wouldn't feel in the capital city of Delhi...

The Sleeper Bus bearth
Not a happy face and only a couple of hours in and motion sickness yet to set in...
So the days are numbered now.....

We've just arrived in Mumbai and it was probably one of the worst experiences of the trip.

We planned to take an overnight train but couldn't get a ticket for the date/times we wanted. So we opted for an overnight sleeper bus which took a little longer and suited our plans.

The website advertised the bus as brand new. This could probably have been the first warning sign..... and you could also say this is where we had the first difference of opinion. In fairness the bus wasn't new but it was reasonably modern - just not all that clean and maybe a little warworn.

I think everything needs to be easy to clean. All of the cushions were this vinly, the curtains were brown (presumably not to show the dirt) and the walls were like a brown lino. (I (Russell) don't have much of an interior bone in my body and even I shuddered a little on sight.) Again in fairness it was about the same as first class on a train so there really isn't too much room to complain here.

Applying infinate wisdom comparing trains and buses when we selected our sleepers, we chose the top births so that no one would be climbing up and down over us and ones that were side by side (Two sleepers side by side all the way down each side of the bus) so that we didn't have to sleep next to anyone we didn't know. It sounds great in theory and if this was a first class train cabin it would have worked perfectly. Only this is still a bus.

When we got on the bus we looked at our bearths. The entire birth for two people was smaller than a single bed. To give this more perspective the birth was 5 foot, 9 inches. Somewhat a problem when Russell is 6 foot, 1 inch. The total head room was 60 - 70cm (give or take - it was the height of Russell's forearm and then a third again) which meant that there was very little head room to move in and certainly no room to even sit. The bearth was around the same width.If we both lay on our backs we could only just uncomfortably fit side by side.

There's always an upside right? There were two 120kg guys who didn't know each other trying to share a bearth opposite us. That was funny for five minutes while they tried to figure out how they would fit in.

There was a possibility we might have slept sporadically throughout the night. No such luck there - that upside is dissappearing quickly. One of the two 120 kg guys snores. And not just snores, snores. I've heard guys who snore and make it sound like there's a freight train running through. This guys sounded like an animal. A very big one that was extremely sick and dying. Kind of like Jabba the Hut. Not only does he snore but he snored for 13 hours straight. We shit you not. 9pm he boards, falls asleep and gets that motor going. 10am we disembark and he's still going. Like a freakin everready battery. He didn't get up or even wake up for any of the stops. This man has a problem. There were no spare bearths on the bus so we couldn't move a little further away.

We passed the time discussing the different ways we could stop him snoring. Syinide was a little too extreme and hard to get hold of so the favourites we a sock in the mouth sealed over with duck tape, a pillow over the face secured in place by a belt or simply putting him down below with the luggage. If it were my choice I would have taken the luggage compartment anyway instead of canoodling a 120kg hairy sweety man that smelled like curry.

Let's not get started on the driving. You couldn't sleep anyway because you need to hold on to stop yourself rolling out of the bunk! I know we joked about that as well. The driver even had a small road rage incident where a man got a baseball bat out of his car and started tapping the windscreen of the bus accusionally.

It all sounds extreme and in reality it was just a pretty long and highly unpleasurable night - one that we will avoid attempting to repeat in the future.

Getting off at the wrong stop in the morning was only a minor detail and a 1200rupee taxi ride across town. But we're here now contemplating weather to venture out for the afternoon or simply hide in our room. So far it's been hiding in the room for 3 hours.

PART TWO - 2 Days later

Well we did venture out and we are glad we did. We quickly cast off any predujices of what an Indian City is and started exploring... more and more.

The city is incredible. The architecture influenced by the British has left some amazing monuments and buildings. The city is on the coast and has a long section much the same as Quay St and then Mission Bay. The city has no structured order but surprises you with naturally occuring areas which are incredible to explore.

The vibe of the city is entirely like anything we have been in during our stay in India and we would have happily spent another couple of days looking around here.

Sorry no photos for all of the above - didn't really get organized for this one.

Either way we finish this sitting in Hong Kong airport...... 7:30am tomorrow morning we'll be back on home ground.

We are finally in Pune! The flight was 3 hours, give or take, from Jaipur to Pune with a stop in Ahamebad. Although Pune is a college town, the poverty rate is worse than everywhere else. Our rooms also took a dive bomb....its hard to go from 4 star to a hole in the wall. My aunt uncle and cousin are all staying with us though, so its nice to be so close. We've finally noticed a smell but our car windows have been open so that explains that. Pune is also about 20 degrees warmer than everywhere else we've been. I'm loving it but everyone else is hot. Last night was henna night. It was so much fun to watch the lady do her thing and the henna smells yummy. It goes on black and raised and after about 12 hours it flakes off and leaves a red tint. Its so beautiful. Today is the pre-wedding party and so the party begins. See yall in a couple of days!
