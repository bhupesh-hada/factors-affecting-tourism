flamingoes at Sewri
The Agumbe-Udupi road was closed for vehicles, but motorbikes were still using it. I got a lift down this road to the village of Someshwara which is on the bottom end of the wildlife reserve (9km from Agumbe). The next bus from there to Udupi wasn't for almost two hours, so we carried on to a town called Hebri another 10km further on. For some reason, even though Udupi to Agumbe is apparently about an hour by bus, from Hebri (which should have been 20km closer) it still took over an hour to get to Udupi. There are trains from Udupi to Mumbai but all seats were booked for the next couple of days. There were only waiting list seats available, which are tickets you buy but can only actually use if someone else doesn't turn up. Instead I went back to the bus station.

It is something like 1000km to Mumbai from Udupi, or 20 hours by bus. I didn't fancy doing this in one trip. I've been on longer bus rides before and they aren't fun, and I really don't like sleeping on overnight buses, mainly because I don't get any sleep. I decided to break the journey
flamingoes at Sewri
in two and asked which were the best in-between towns for this. Ankola was about four hours away, Belagam was halfway at about eight (I know half of twenty hours isn't eight hours, but this is what they told me). It was already noon at this stage, and so I chose Ankola, figuring that if I left there early the next morning I'd get to Mumbai late afternoon.

In Ankola I stayed at the Radha Krishna Lodge which is across the road from the bus station and had a relatively amusing name, if you know what I mean. It was 300 rupees and infested with bed bugs. In the morning I had about a hundred bites across my back and a couple of dozen on my feet. Other than that it was fine.

As usual, upon arrival in the town I had to spend half an hour walking through the streets just trying to find an ATM that worked. The daily withdrawal limit had just gone up to 2500 rupees (previously it was 2000 rupees), although the machines seemed to decide for themselves what they wanted to let you take out. I was of the opinion that the
flamingoes at Sewri
seemingly endless number of days for which the withdrawal limit was set so low was a deliberate strategy by the government to try and force the country into a cashless society. There's a big push for this in India right now, trying to convince everybody that EFTPOS and credit cards are the way to go. Which is fine, it's just that India is not even close to being ready for this. It's like putting a dog in front of a piano, showing it how noise is made when it puts its paw on the keys, and then just expecting it to be able to play Chopsticks. It's not going to happen. Even for me, as a tourist, probably 90%!o(MISSING)f my spending can only be done with cash. The cheaper accommodations don't have EFTPOS facilities, most of the places I eat don't, you can only pay for tuktuks with cash, you can only pay for buses with cash unless you buy tickets online or from agents and even then I think probably only for the more expensive ""tourist buses"" rather than the local buses I take. Then the locals have all that (except the hotels) plus they need to buy
flamingoes at Sewri
food at the markets. A huge percentage of the population don't even have any sort of bank cards. Six days later the withdrawal limit went up to 4500 rupees which shot down my theory.

My splitting of the Udupi to Mumbai trip into two days to make each section shorter did not work. It just made it more convoluted. As it turned out, Ankola wasn't even on the direct Udupi to Mumbai route. Instead at 5.45am I took a bus from Ankola to Hubli, three hours away, and then from there a two hour bus to Belagam. From there I could get another bus for the next 500km to Mumbai. In other words, it took me five hours just to get from Ankola to the bus I needed to get to Mumbai! All these buses were of the ""old school bus"" type, probably rejects from other third-world countries. At least the final bus, the one to Mumbai, was mostly empty, unlike the sardine-can trips of all the others.

The Mumbai-bound bus left Belagam at 11.40am. I had asked the conductor how long the trip was and he had said ten hours. Sadly, I believed him. At 9.30pm we
flamingoes at Sewri
rolled into a big city and I'm thinking ""this must be Mumbai"". I was about to get my bags but the conductor motioned me to sit back down. This was Pune. There were still four hours to go before we reached Mumbai.

At 1.30am I finally reached Mumbai. Almost twenty hours since I left Ankola. All the cheap hotels seemed to be closed for the night. I drove around in a little taxi for a while looking for somewhere that was open. Most that we tried were shut or full. One was 1600 rupees and had cockroaches literally just running about on the bed; the guy just shrugged when I pointed that out. Eventually I ended up at a crappy place called the New Shalimar Hotel which was still too expensive (1000 rupees per night) but it was 3am by this time and I needed to sleep! At least with this hotel I could pay for my stay with my credit card and they had WIFI.

I'm usually an early riser, but after yesterday's twenty hours of bus rides and not getting to a bed until 3am I expected to be sleeping late. Instead I woke up at
flamingoes at Sewri
8am (so, late for me but much earlier than I had expected). I didn't want to be spending long in Mumbai, partly because it was expensive and partly because I just don't like big cities. My main sights to see were the flamingoes at Sewri mudflats, the Byculla Zoo, the Bombay Natural History Museum, and the Karnala Bird Sanctuary. It was too late to visit the bird sanctuary today (it is a fair way outside the city), so after getting some breakfast I headed to Sewri.

Although most people (or at least me) tend to associate flamingoes with Africa, every year 30,000 flamingoes migrate southwards to Mumbai and settle at Sewri. About 95% are lesser flamingoes and the rest greater flamingoes. I'd never seen a flamingo before, except in zoos, and Mumbai had a firm place in my itinerary for this specific purpose.

The nearest train station to my hotel was the Sandhurst Road Station. Having just arrived I didn't realise the Mumbai taxis all have meters - this isn't something which is really normal in Asia - so I got charged 100 rupees to get from the hotel to the station when the real price (as I
striped hyaena cages, Mumbai Zoo
found out on the return trip with the meter) was about 30 rupees. Sewri Station is just four stops along from the Sandhurst Road Station - the ticket costs just five rupees - and once there you just cross the tracks and find one of the roads heading east. There's an actual road-crossing at the station from which you just keep walking until you hit a T-junction (and then turn right) but I followed some other local people across the tracks themselves and went along a smaller road, through some slums. A policeman on a motorbike asked what I was doing there - perhaps I looked like I didn't belong - and when I said I was going to the jetty to see the flamingoes he said he'd give me a lift there on his bike.

The best time to see the flamingoes, so I had read in a book called ""Where To Watch Birds In World Cities"" (it really does exist), was five hours before high tide because during high tide they all disappear into the mangroves. It was strange to imagine 30,000 flamingoes disappearing into mangroves but apparently it is so. Anyway, it was high tide when
deer, crocodylians, and turtles; Mumbai Zoo
I arrived and there were zero flamingoes. The policeman said to come back at 2 or 3pm.

To fill in the day I took a taxi from by the train station to the Byculla Zoo which was not what I was expecting from a zoo in Mumbai. I saw my first Indian grey mongooses there, wild ones hanging out in the hyaena cage with some domestic cats.

I didn't know much about the Mumbai Zoo before I visited. I had the assumption that as one of the major cities in India, the zoo would be one of the major zoos. To my surprise it was so small and half-empty of animals that I was out in half an hour. It was one of those strange visits where you've seen the whole place, seen every cage and animal on show, but you've barely walked in. You think ""should I go round a few more times?"" but there isn't any point because there's nothing more to see and what is there wasn't worth seeing in the first place.

The entry fee is just five rupees. Strangely, water is not allowed into the zoo. Every person entering has their bag searched and any food and water is removed. I understand the food part, to stop people feeding the animals and littering, but the water part was a first for me. I can only assume it is to prevent the plastic bottles being thrown around. I argued with the guards that I can't walk around in that heat without water - I'm not Indian after all! - and after a while they got sick of me and just let me through. I needn't have bothered with the effort, given the short time I was in there.

The zoo was established in 1861, originally called Victoria Gardens by the British, and it does look like how you might imagine a Victorian-era animal collection in a garden setting in India. There are very few animals here, but also many enclosures were blocked off or empty or being demolished or being re-wired. The hooved stock had basic pens with a dry moat and wall-barrier surrounding each one. Most of the other animals were in menagerie cages. There were a few aviaries, including some very large ones for water birds. Bizarrely the emus were in a barred cage - the only other place I've seen emus in a cage is at the Calcutta Zoo.

Having spent less than half an hour at the zoo, I headed for the Bombay Natural History Museum. The taxi driver assured me he knew where it was, but we were driving so far from the zoo, to which I had thought it was relatively close, that I had some strong doubts. My doubts became even stronger when we stopped outside an art gallery and the driver says ""museum"". Um, no. I asked someone outside the gallery and he told my driver where to take me, which was basically around the corner - the driver had inadvertently brought me to much the right place by sheer accident. I got out at the building for the Bombay Natural History Society which is where I thought the museum was (it was next door) and was met by a guy who wanted to walk me to the museum entrance.

""You look like a Greek God,"" he said to me, almost as an opening remark.
""Um, okay...""
""Are you bachelor or married?""
""Bachelor"" This is a standard question, to which they respond with amazement when you say you aren't married.
""So you can travel because you are a bachelor!""
""Yes.""
""""Have you ever done any nude modelling?""
""Um, no....?"" This was a bit of a strange question from someone who only met me one minute ago.
""Have you had any nude photographs taken of you?""
""No."" Must remain polite.
""Have you ever had a sexual experience with a man or a woman?""
""Not with men..."" Looking around for a means of escape.
""With a man?"" This was where he suddenly sounded really hopeful.
""NOT with a man!""
""So you have had a sexual experience with a woman?""
""Yes...""
""What do you like to do?"" Then he starts listing sex acts.

That was when I'd had enough of being polite and told him to piss off.

When I got to the museum entrance the fee was 500 rupees. I decided I didn't need to go in there after all. After a surprisingly difficult time trying to find somewhere to have lunch I headed back to Sewri where it was now approaching low tide. And there were the flamingoes. Thousands of them.

Flamingoes are one of those animals which are really weird to see in the wild, like peacocks. You are so familiar with them from zoos and every childrens' animal book ever that it's almost like ""oh okay, flamingoes"" instead of ""oh my god, flamingoes!!"" I don't know if there were 30,000 of them - I don't even know how you would count them - but there were LOTS. And the greater flamingoes were surprisingly easy to distinguish even at a distance because they were white while the lesser flamingoes were pink. So there were great swathes of pink, and then one big blob of white, and those were the greater flamingoes. The greaters are greater too, of course, being maybe twice the height of the lessers, but this isn't so obvious except when they are standing right next to each other. As the tide moved the flamingoes moved closer, and groups of lessers were flying back and forth. Really awesome birds to see.

It wasn't just flamingoes on the mudflats of course, although the majority of the waders were too far off to identify without a scope. But there were quite a number of western reef egrets which is a heron I have wanted to see for a long time, as well as redshanks, greenshanks, Eurasian curlews, little stints, and various plovers.

The next day I went to the Karnala Bird Sanctuary. This is quite a way from Mumbai by the town of Panvel, which is an hour south by train so you need to start early. I got to the Sandhurst Road Station at 6am, bought a ticket for 20 rupees (and there's nobody else there that early, so no queues), and the ticket guy told me that train coming into the station right now goes to Panvel. I quickly jumped on and 35 minutes later I was at Andheri Station, the last stop. I had to go all the way back to Sandhurst Road Station, not in the best mood, to wait for the next train which really went to Panvel. Instead of getting to the sanctuary at 7.30am I was only just leaving (again) Sandhurst Road at that time.

In Panvel I walked round to the bus station, about 500 metres distant, and found a bus to Karnala. I had read they go every half an hour, but when I was at the sanctuary I saw at least four go by within about ten minutes. From Panvel the bus takes about half an hour and I got dropped right at the entrance. It was now close to 10am - almost four hours to get there!

The sole reason I wanted to visit Karnala was because four-horned antelope (chousingha) are found here. This is the only living antelope with four horns, and I had reasoned that they would be easiest to see early in the day before it got too hot and before many people were around. That may have been a correct reasoning because I didn't see any. The sanctuary is mostly dry forest, and would be nice early morning I think. I saw hardly any birds (all very common species) but there were three species of monkeys - rhesus macaques, bonnet macaques, and southern plains grey langurs. I think the Indian Mammal Field Guide includes these particular langurs as within the range of black-footed grey langurs (that author doesn't recognise the Southern Plains species) but they look very different. These were the first I'd seen and made the 70th mammal species I've seen on this trip (of which 36 have been ""lifers"" - ones I've seen for the first time in the wild - which is over half so a pretty good rate).

Shaniwar Wada, situated in Pune, Maharashtra, INDIA is approximately 285 year old fortification built in 1732, used to be the palace of Bajirao I, who was the second Peshwa (Prime Minister) of Maratha empire. He was Peshwa during the regime of Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj, the grandson of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. As the foundation stone laid down on Shaniwar (Saturday), it is named as Shaniwar Wada. It was a magnificent building during the period of Bajirao I and was in its full glory during that time. It used to be a seven story building with a ground floor made of stones and rest of the floor made of wood. It is said that later on in 1828 due to some fire the wooden floors got destroyed. Even today the remaining structure of Shaniwar Wada is telling the story of gallantry & courage of Bajirao I and is a symbol of pride of Maratha Empire. The main entrance among the five entrances of the fort, called Dilli Darwaja along with the balcony above is adding grandeur to the fort palace. The main entrance doors have big sharp nails to stop elephants of enemy’s army. The remaining structure has been preserved well. Lawns are

beautifully maintained. There is a fountain also in the fort palace. When you walk on the peripheral ground floor’s terrace, it gives a bird eye view of the building on one hand and the look of adjacent city roads on the other hand. There is a grand statue of Bajirao I outside the fort palace. Parking was not available in Shaniwar Wada car parking when we reached there during our visit to Pune in December 2016. We had to search around to get the car parking and finally got it in the Shaniwar Wada parking itself. Indeed, it was a nice experience to be there and was an awesome opportunity to learn about the Peshwas and Maratha Empire.

December 11th 2016
Published: January 9th 2017


Gateway Of India
The most iconic monument in Mumbai was built to commemorate the royal visit to India of King George V.
My night bus to Mumbai was much nicer than the one I took to Jalgaon. This one had sheets, a blanket and a pillow! I just wish I felt as clean as my sleeper having for the second time in a row, caught a night bus straight after a journey from somewhere else during the day, meaning I had no chance to take a much needed shower.
About halfway through the trip however, I realised that my wallet had fallen out of my pocket - or even worse, had been pick-pocketed from me during my sleep. Asking the crew riding with the driver in the 'cockpit', there was a bit of a language barrier as I tried to explain what had happened. I was even beginning to think it might have been one of the crew. Getting increasingly desperate, my mind went back to the time when I had my wallet pick-pocketed in Guatemala - also on a bus. One of the crew asks me how much money I had in there. I tell him that I had about ₹2,500. I wasn't quite sure what to make of what they were trying to tell me but it seemed like they hadn't seen it. When I tell them I also had

cards in it, it seems to trigger an ""a-ha"" moment and he produces my wallet. I assume he was winding me up earlier with the questions and I praise him for a good joke. He tells me not to leave it in my pockets and I promptly lock it up in my bag.
The thing was however, was that when leaving the bus, I am asked for ₹200.
""For what?!"" I ask.
Apparently, I should be grateful they didn't decide to keep my wallet by rewarding them financially for their honesty. I tell them ""no way"" and that they had done what any honest and righteous person should've done by returning it and that that is what all people should do as decent human beings, rather than for reward or gain. I couldn't believe it but I could at the same time. Is this the expected thing to do over here? When I think back on things, the man who eventually handed my wallet back did seem to handle the notes in my wallet a lot - what I thought might've been a hint for me to give him something. Jesus, it's all about money and something for something over

here.

I wasn't dropped off as close to my hotel as I was expecting but it was still walkable - and it was a walk that shocked me. I don't think I have ever seen so many homeless people; it got to the point where I had to wheel my backpack on the road because there would have been too many sleeping homeless people - and at that time of the morning, fishmongers with the catch of the day - to get through on the footpath. Like much of the situation in India, I wondered how it had all come to this.

The hotel was pretty dirty and crusty and I'm sharing a dorm in it as it was the cheapest place I could find with a central location close to the sights. The place still functions like a hotel however and has an army of porters and cleaners who cook you your complimentary breakfast, take your laundry and bring water to your room. Housed in an old building, the hotel nevertheless had a charm to it - with the chequered floors, the old fans and the Mumbai heat, it did feel like I was having a classic

Indian hotel experience from the 50s.
Laundry however, has been comparatively expensive in India as they charge per item of clothing. I have had to pay £5-£7 each time which is half my daily budget and is expensive even by European standards. It reminded me of two extortionate laundry fees I paid in Latin America - once in Chile and the other for self-service in Nicaragua.

Perhaps more than any other city in India, the British have well and truly left their mark in Mumbai - or Bombay, as it used to be called. It seemed a bit incongruous to see Victorian, gothic architecture through jungle vines and palm trees and it makes me think that this would be what London would feel like if it had a tropical climate. Speaking of climate, it is noticeably hotter and more humid here in Mumbai than it was further north and further inland, even in the evenings which have a lovely balmy feel, where you can just go out for the evening in shorts, a t-shirt and flip-flops. Anyway, Mumbai's architectural highlights include the old Victoria train station - much more ornate than its London namesake - now called the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, which
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya

reminds me a lot of St Pancras International Station in London. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya Museum also boasts some stunning British architecture as well as some lovely gardens; the High Court is imposing but annoyingly hidden by trees; and the old Bombay University and its Rajabai Clock Tower reminded me of the gothic clock tower at my old university, The University Of Auckland. The high court and the university sit opposite Oval Maidan, where the sea used to be; now it is a big park where local cricketers exhibit gentility in genteel surrounds.
And this has been the most striking thing about Mumbai so far, especially around the Fort area where my hostel is; everything is so orderly! There is actual space between people, it is relatively clean, you're not always dodging motorbikes and there is significantly less noise than any other place I have been to in India. It was so unexpected with Mumbai having a population of some 21 million inhabitants. The street the hostel is on is even leafy and quiet!

Mumbai's two most iconic sights in reside right next to each other on the sea. First, there is the Gateway To India which
Taj Mahal Palace
This iconic and historically significant hotel is India's second-most photographed monument after the mausoleum that it is named after.
is perhaps symbolic more than anything but this arch is such a popular meeting spot that there is security to pass through and on the first evening I tried to get in, the line stretched back several hundred metres. Opposite the gateway is the Taj Mahal Palace which as well as being a grandiose landmark, has had a fairly significant role to play in India's history. It was built by a local industrialist after he was refused entry to a European hotel for ""being a native""; it was the first hotel in the country to employ women; it housed freedom fighters free of charge during the struggle for independence; and it was where several were killed during the 2008 terrorist attacks. Thanks to the angle of the sun, the Taj is best visited in the morning while the gateway is definitely an late afternoon affair with the western sun illuminating the arch.

India in general has it, but perhaps Mumbai has it the worst - pollution. Ever since I've arrived in India, my snot has been black. Sure, it was black in London too, but that was because of the Underground. Here there seem to be no restrictions on
Brihan Mumbai Mahanagarpalika

burning or fumes, or if there are, then no-one gives a shit. When I look at the weather forecast, Yahoo tells me every day that the weather is ""smoke"". I didn't even know that that was a type of weather! Something was always burning close by in the middle of the night and had me waking up coughing. All of this can't be good for my general health, particularly for my lungs. It must be like smoking a pack a day.

Perhaps more annoying than the pollution however has been dealing with some of the locals. You can never seem to get a straight answer out of anyone. If they don't understand something you're asking them, they'll simply nod their head and say yes - they never seem to want to admit that they don't know something, which sends you on a wild goose chase, and it's infuriating. They'll give a vague 'yes' even if it's not a yes/no question. If they don't want to give you an answer - either to keep a bargaining position or because they want to cover something up - then they'll either smile, nod and say yes, or give you an answer to
Oval Maidan

a completely different question. Often, you'll have to ask two or three times just to make sure they understand what you have asked or to even get something done. There always seems to be some sort of misunderstanding in every conversation.

There was one truly outstanding exception however. While watching cricket in the Oval Maidan, an old man shouts from a park bench an enquiry about where I was from. Instantly, you could tell that he was a bit different to anyone else trying to get something out of you; for a start he spoke excellent English which made it easier for him to engage you in normal conversation, but you could detect genuine sincerity from what he was saying. Perhaps it was easier for him this time as we both had a shared love of cricket. I was after a ticket to the test match between India and England here the next day and upon learning that I was going to the wrong place to try and get one, Javed offered to walk me to the actual ticket office. Along the way, we talked about cricket - which he was very knowledgeable about - and about each other's

lives and families. There is a massive queue when we arrive at the ticket office but one of the stewards - who he seemed to know - said that it would be quicker for me to buy my tickets online before coming back to collect them. Javed of course knows an internet cafe nearby (they're still a thing here in India) and I make sure he is looking away when I enter my card details; but I don't need to as he was already looking away. We go back to the ticket office with my printout and within five minutes, I have my tickets! The guy has already managed to save me a load of time and hassle. When I ask him why he was helping me and what he was getting out of it, he actually gives me a straight answer; he admits he is a ""tour guide"" but that his way of making money was to build up a good, trusting relationship with potential clients like myself and then leaves it up to his clients as to how much they want to pay him or even if they want his services. Most importantly he says, he never complains

about the amounts given to him, no matter how small - even if people use him for free. It's a bit like those free walking tours that rely on donations; the better the tour, the more you feel compelled to give. He definitely seemed to be working his charms - I already felt like I owed the guy for his selfless help.
As it was now around lunchtime, I offer to buy him lunch, which he accepts. He takes me to a nice-ish restaurant that is still fairly cheap and he recommend dishes to me as well as telling me that we could share one curry, since the servings here were big. And he was right - one curry was definitely enough for the both of us. He was also giving me loads of advice about booking trains, buses and accommodation - including a lowdown on Goa, my next destination. Everything he was telling me was about how to save money and make my life easier. I could tell he was steering me towards allowing him to take me on a tour of Mumbai; but when I decided to part ways after lunch, he was totally OK with it. When

I offer to give him tickets to the cricket for the days I'm not going, he refuses; he wasn't too bothered about going to the game and he says he is too righteous to sell them on the black market, which I encourage him to do. All he asked for was ten rupees so that he could buy a cigarette; which I was more than happy to give him. Although he was ultimately looking to make some money like everyone else in this city, he has chosen to give without expecting anything in return and was at peace with that; because even if he didn't receive anything back, he was happy in the knowledge that he has been able to help someone and show off his city and country in the process. It is a noble and trusting business model and it was so refreshing to see, especially in India; if only everyone else in this country - and indeed the world - was more like this.

Instead of going on a tour with Javed, I took a walk along Marine Drive, the Malecón of Mumbai. Coastal cities seem to have another dimension and this is certainly true of
Marine Drive

Mumbai. Marine Drive - as well as around the Oval Maidan - is full of beautiful art-deco buildings, my favourite architectural style. So Marine Drive has even more in common with the Malecon other than being a walkable waterfront looking out into the ocean.
At the northern end of Marine Drive is Girgaum Chowpatty, the city beach. The Arabian Sea is far too polluted to go for a swim unfortunately but nevertheless this was the first time I had set foot on a beach since I was in Odessa, Ukraine, some two-and-a-half months ago.
Not far from the beach is Kotachiwadi, a peaceful hamlet of two-storey wooden mansion blocks that may have been built in the 19th century. It was a pocket of tranquillity from the noise and chaos just outside and gives an insight into what life used to be like in Mumbai back in the day. It was also full of colourful streamers and decorations.
I then walked back to the hostel via the crazy central markets, which was madness. This was more like Old Delhi (but still not as crazy). Bhuleshwar Market sells fruit and vegetables, Zaveri sells jewellery, Mangaldas fabrics and the Victorian style Crawford Market...well...everything.

Test Match Cricket
I went along to the Wankhede Stadium to watch India play England. Here, Indian captain Virat Kohli is batting, on his way to a double century.
remember watching live broadcasts of test cricket matches from India as a kid and remembering how crazy and fanatical the crowds were - for test matches no less! I was hoping to experience something similar here as I rocked up to the Wankhede Stadium, which was a twenty minute walk from the hotel. While not exactly as crazy as I remember from TV as a kid, the atmosphere was still far noisier and colourful than perhaps any other country in terms of a test match crowd. The drums and percussion were particularly fascinating and much more lively than the droning brass band that follows the English football team.
Although I've never exactly been fond of the English cricket team, I found myself rooting for them here. After all, I am a British citizen now and they are the underdogs on this occasion. But more than anything, although the Indian crowd are amazingly passionate and noisy - sometimes putting the English batsmen under tremendous pressure when they were going through a tricky spell, like a good home crowd should - booing and whistling the English for having the nerve to review decisions (which the English are entitled to do) and for

having the audacity to appeal, didn't make them the most likeable crowd. This is a gentleman's game after all. Nevertheless, attending a couple of days of test cricket in India was an enjoyable and fascinating experience.

With 60% of Mumbai's population - so that's 12 million people - living in slums, my Mumbai experience would not have been complete without visiting one. The Lonely Planet-recommended Reality Tours did a tour to Mumbai's biggest slum and the inspiration behind Slumdog Millionaire; Dharavi.
Dharavi however is more than just a slum - it is a thriving hotbed of industry, resourcefulness and enterprise. The first place that we visit on the tour is a plastic recycling plant and our guides gives us some sad facts about the place. While the entrepreneurship and ingenuity is admirable, it is a hard life working here - and a short one too. For just ₹250 (£3) a day, men work for eight to ten hours next to hot, smoking furnaces; as if Mumbai wasn't hot enough. They breathe in so much smoke however, that life expectancy working in the furnaces is only 45-50 years.
As we snake our way through the impossibly dark and narrow alleys
Dharavi
The only picture I could take of Mumbai's biggest slum.
that separate the buildings here in Dharavi, I am reminded of the tour I did through a couple of Rio's favelas. Here however, each family normally has about a 10sqm room to live in; there would be a ""wet corner"" for people to wash in but otherwise this one room smaller than the size of my bedroom back in London, would be the entire living space. During monsoon season, the majority of houses would flood up to knee-deep - floods that would contain sewage and industrial waste. This becomes apparent when we pass a filthy canal full of sewage and pollution that goes straight into the Arabian Sea. Sanitation is a major issue in the slums; in Dharavi, there are just 700 toilets for half a million people that are only cleaned weekly.
But perhaps what angered me most is the fact that corporations are exploiting the hard, sometimes deadly work done in Dharavi. For example, women slave away making poppadoms which they then sell to restaurant suppliers for less than ₹10 a kilo. However these suppliers then go on to sell the same poppadoms for around ₹40-₹50 a kilo. It's just not right. The tour overall was both eye-opening and

heartbreaking at the same time - but it was an essential thing to do nonetheless. And at least my visit gave something back to the community; Reality Tours give 80%!o(MISSING)f all their profits back into Dharavi in the forms of free English lessons, life skills sessions and computer training.
My tour of Dharavi was in stark contrast to my evening walk as I strolled along Marine Drive as the sun went down over its southern end, full of hotels and corporate office towers. There are 21 billionaires in Mumbai - the inequality is shocking and it's just not right when millions in the city are literally slumming it; even more so when corporations are exploiting the people working in the slums. It just goes to show that conscience and empathy take a back seat when it comes to money.

The next day, I along with two Yorkshiremen I was sharing a dorm with at the hotel, Sam and Matt, visited the Mahalaxhmi Dobi Ghat - the city's massive open-air, human-powered laundromat made up of 1,026 concrete baths and about the same number of dhobis getting through much of Mumbai's dirty laundry. My hotel had managed to lose a

pair of my favourite underpants when they did my laundry so I wondered if they were lurking around somewhere here in the ghat.
After visiting the ghat, we then walked to Haji Ali Dargah, a crumbling island mosque just off the coast and reachable by a narrow causeway. It wasn't quite Mont St Michel or even St Michael's Mount, but it is nevertheless a popular attraction and there are plenty of hawkers lining the causeway. The mosque itself is nothing special and is falling apart - it really is all about its setting.
We skipped the nearby Mahalaxmi Temple when we saw the queue for it; and the Hanging Gardens were a bit of disappointment - they were far from the Hanging Gardens Of Babylon that were considered one of the seven ancient wonders of the world. They did provide some OK views over the city though.

For a place with so much English influence and where all the signs are in English, I expected the locals' command of the language to be much better than it is. Many of the uneducated locals don't understand any at all. I'm not saying that they should be able to speak English - but
Khotachiwadi

it was surprising and it made things difficult at times, especially when normal modes of sign and body language don't seem to work here.
One place where they definitely knew what they were doing was at an Irish bar Sam and I went to on our last night in the city. A fairly big pub that wouldn't be out of place back in the U.K., they were charging ₹300 for a bottle of Budweiser. I felt so ripped off. That is almost the price of one night's accommodation, two meals, or even worse, more than a whole day's work in Dharavi. Shocking.

To sum things up however, I can describe the hour or so we spent at the Oval Maidan after watching a day's test cricket at the Wankhede Stadium. There was an official-looking game of cricket taking place in the middle with a proper pitch, proper umpires and everything; but all round were rogue games of cricket and football more than just encroaching on the field of play. It was ridiculous - the fielders would have to dodge football players, fielders from other matches and people picnicking in the park when trying to field the ball or take

catches. There was so much potential for a serious accident. Yet everyone just went on with things, just like how Indians get on with their daily lives. Sharing space is just an unavoidable fact of life and somehow, everyone manages to cooperate and get things done.

It was time now however, for a bit of a break from 'real' India as I head for the western beaches of Goa and all of the Westerners on holiday there, for a Xmas holiday of my own.

Oval Maiden on a sunday afternoon
What to do in 24 hours in Mumbai? Markus was keen on paying this megacity another visit. I, Nina, not so much. After the peaceful and relaxing time in Goa, it was to hard to dive into the noise and pollution of Mumbai. But as the flight to Delhi directly from Goa was quite expensive at that time of the year, we had to take a flight via Mumbai anyway. So it was ok to spend 1 day and 1 night in this city. The year before we had found a great deal for a hotel in Andheri with free pick up at the airport. The same hotel this time was too expansive, so we booked another option which was just around the corner. But it turned out that this option was a terrible one. If you ever chose to stay in Andheri, try to avoid the Andheri Residency Hotel! It is a rippoff!

Anyway, the flight from Goa was cheap, quick an 1 hour delayed. When we arrived in our hotel, they proudly told us that we will get an upgreat to one of the suites. Well, we were lucky. The room we got was OK for the price
great bookshop in Bhulaneshwar
we payed - but it definitely was not a suite. Once we had a further look it was only fairly clean. But ok. It was still ok and just for 1 night. Just the reception was really special. They had a big sign ""service beyong a smile"". OK, we never saw anyone smiling, and the service was beyond. It was non existing. They told us that the airport pickup was not included, although mentioned in the agoda website where we booked. And they charged us 460 Rupees! An official taxi is not more than 200 Rupees. Well, discussions were useless. OK, we checked in an quickly decided what to do with the rest of the early evening. We decided to pay the ISCON in Juhu a visit. It is a beautiful temple and we love going there. It is not far from the hotel and, definitely an important aspect, it has tasty and safe food for really cheap prices and an excellent chai tea. As it was a saturday evening, the temple was really busy. But nice anyway. We took in the atmophere, sat down to meditate a little bit, looked around the shops there an finally got some really
in Khala Ghoda
nice food for about 2$ for 2 people. And this in the middle of Mumbai! Already late, we left. It was hard to get a taxi back. It is about a 15 minute drive but kind of a different region and not all rickshaw drivers are willing to drive to a different part of town. Or they do notspeak english. But after asking about 10 different drivers, we found one using the meter. Safely we came back to the hotel. The night was terrible. The aircon was freezing cold. The only possibility was to switch it off - than it was too hot. Well, so much about this hotel which surely will never see us again!

Next day, after a pretty average breakfast, we packed everything and left our luggage at the hotel. We took a rickshaw to Andheri train station. From there, it was a 30 minutes ride by the express line to the Chowpatty (Marine Drive). Our aim was to visit the oldest part of Mumbai with its bazars, temple and the panjapol. So, from the Marine Drive it was a short walk to Bhuleshwar. Our first aim was the Madhav Baugh and the Lakshmi Narayana Temple.
on the train from Andheri to Mumbai
We attended the aarti at the temple. The streets on sunday morning were still empty, but the temple was packed with people. It was very nice, although we felt that people were not really happy with foreigners attending the ceremonies. Further on we continued our walk through th bazar streets. Slowly, also the streets were getting busier and busier. We also paid a visit the cows in panjapole. The panjapole is a place where cows from the streets are rescued. They live now in the middle of Mumbai and get fresh, nice food. It is a super peaceful place in the middle of the oldest part of Mumbai. Around the panjapole it is loud, stinky, hectic - but inside it is quiet and peaceful. The cows are really treated well, they look healty and even young ones are plentiful. We bought some stuff at the bazar for really good prices. We still had some money cash left to spend. The salesmen were so happy. Even in Mumbai, especially in the bazar region, business is going very bad. Some shops offer credit card payments. They receive lots of customers. And the rest - nothing. Lots of shops were closed, many of

them already abandoned and empty. After a while we had enough of the hectic life of the bazars (it is always nice and fantastic for a while - but after 2 hours we had to leave). We took a taxi at the Jama Masjid which brought us to the Flora Fountain. We walked through Khala Ghoda, an area we really like. Especially on a sunday it is nice with many cafés, restaurants and galleries. Finally we went to the Pantry's, our favourite café. We had eggless waffles and delicious fresh juices and organic teas. It is a little oasis in Mumbai.

Unfortunately it was already late afternoon and we had to be at the airport at around 6 pm. So time to slowly go back. We walked past the Oval Maiden - where every sunday it is incredably busy. The groun dis packed with cricket players. There are different tournaments, different groups or just families playing. We wondered that people are not hurt because it is really dangerous to walk around. But it is great fun. We watched the life there for a while before taking our train back to Andheri and then the taxi to the airport.
sugar cane juice anyone?
oh, we love this juice!

Once at the airport, a ""fun"" journey back home started. Our flight to Delhi was nearly 2 hours delayed. This flight was a cheap flight we had booked extra. We had 5 hours in Delhi, to make sure we get our flight to Moscow and Zurich. OK, with 2 hours we would still have 3 hours left which is ok. But it would be a bit hectic as we had to change from the domestic to the international terminal in Delhi. But ok. Sitting around at Mumbai domestic airport we suddenly got a message, that our flight to Mumbai was delayed as well for 1 hour. That was great news. But finally, we left Mumbai only 3 hours before the delayed departure of our next flight. So, 1 hour before the already delayed departure of the next flight we landed in Delhi. Luckily, our bags arrived quickly and we ran out, jumped into a much too expensive taxi which brought us in 10 (!) minutes to the international terminal. The guy was driving like crazy. We did not bother about the queue to get into the airport. We ran to the next police officer who let us in quickly. And
transport in Mumbai
then the shock: the gate was already closed (40 minutes before departure). OK, we tried to be relaxed and walked to the Aeroflot check in counter. 2 ladies could still check us in, but we really needed to hurry up. The plane had just landed, so they inofficially helped us. How lucky we were. It would have ruined our budget terribly if we had to buy a new return ticket for both! So we ran through the security check. And once more, I, Nina, was really lucky. A little girl in front of me started vomitting and it was pure luck that I realised this early enough to jump away. Well, otherwise...... (I do not want to think about it). We passed the visa control and hurried up to the gate. And then...... we had much more time than expected as the delay was much worse. So finally we relaxed and went for a last chai to calm down. We could even buy some cheap ayurvedic products - and for whatever reason, even got the best seat on the plane: 2 seats at the emergency exit. So it was a very comfortable night flight to Moscow (we slept throughout the
our suite - looking great from far away, but dirty on a close look
noisy and a terribly aircon as well
flight). In Moscow we had 4 hours to kill. Time to habe a look around the airport which was surprisingly modern and pleasant. It was huge and there were so many shops, we had never seen before. But hell, it was expensive! Anyway, we enjoyed a nice breakfast before we boarded the last flight back to Zurich.

It was our 5th time in India. It is a fascinating country. We love it and sometimes we hate it. It is a rollercoaster, a world of its own. And, for sure, we will come back. But we both agree that we need a break at the moment. If it is for our spiritual master, we will always immediately go back to India. But for a private holiday, we have different plans this time. Let's see what will come true ;-).

Cave 26
This was probably the jewel in the crown - a chatiya with magnificently intricate columns and that is dramatically lit.
When travelling, you have to take decisions on whether visiting an attraction is worth the effort. In this case, I had a five hour bus ride to Ahmedabad, two overnight buses and a stay in a rural village to contend with to visit my next sight. I could easily have skipped it and taken one direct overnight bus straight from Udaipur to Mumbai - but visiting Ajanta seemed to be ""on the way"" to Mumbai, and even when I realised thanks to transport connections that it sorta wasn't, I decided to go anyway. I've got time up my sleeve.

Also when you're travelling, you take risks - especially when there is the potential for fun! Which is why rather than having an early night before an early start and twenty four hours of travelling the next day, I went out for one last third-of-a-bhang-lassi. Maybe it wasn't quite enough - I didn't want to get completely baked like the night before but perhaps half a bhang lassi would've been perfect. With beer pong and a few drinks following on afterwards, I didn't really want to leave Udaipur as things at the hostel finally started to pick up, along with a

new, cool cast of guests.
But I had to move on.

In my last blog entry, I said that if Indian buses were of the same quality as the ones in South America, then I'd probably prefer to travel by bus. Well, they're not like South American buses. At all. The floor on this one was made of wood and the bus in general has seen better days. This was a sleeper bus - not something I have seen before but it was nice to have your own space (your own ""curtained cabin"") much like you would in sleeper class on the train, but the ride was bumpy.

Looking outside, I reckon that India has the worst pollution I have ever seen. India always has a smell; whether it's sewage, smog, shit or smoke coming off a burning mountain of trash, there is always something unpleasant in the air. On the road, there seem to be no rules whatsoever and if there are any, then they pretty much go disregarded. I had been told that Indian traffic is the craziest in the world and while my travels mean that I haven't been shocked by anything I have seen
Ajanta Caves
Looking along the gorge towards the entrance.
in India so far, I can definitely say that Indian traffic jams and the craziness of driving are on another level.

I was originally going to skip Ahmedabad but when it became apparent that I had to make a connection there, I then decided to stay a couple of nights. When I couldn't find any decent, decently-priced accommodation in a city with little to see and almost certainly with more mayhem to contend with, I decided that the city was skippable after all.
Arriving in town, I hadn't done my homework in terms of loading the map and finding out where I needed to catch my onward bus, but then I didn't know where I was being dropped off. My SIM card then let me down at precisely the wrong time as a lack of mobile internet meant I didn't know where I was going and nor could I order an Uber, or at least get an Uber fare estimate to bargain with. I was thus left completely at the mercy of a tuk-tuk driver with the bus having dropped me on a road on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. The driver had a fare chart which seemed legit but

The colours were all created from local minerals apart from the blue, apparently.
it was all in Gujarati - I had no choice but to take his word that at ₹450, I would need to pay him almost twice what I paid for the bus to Ahmedabad, simply to get across to the other side of town get to catch my connecting bus - outside a shitty building on a busy, dusty road where I would have to wait a further hour and a half.
About two hours later, I had no idea what was going on as I and other passengers I assume were also on the same bus, were ushered on to one bus, which dropped us at another travel agency, before we somehow managed to squeeze eight people including all our luggage into a tuk-tuk for a short ride up the road to our actual bus.

Our bus, like every other bus, had an interesting horn that played a short, happy tune which was nicer than hearing the constant, annoying, monotone beep of a normal horn.
Despite being able to lie down in my sleeper, Indian roads and the relative age of the bus ensured a bumpy, rattly ride. I still managed to get a little sleep although it

was freezing in the morning.
Arriving in the industrial town of Jalgaon the next morning, thankfully I was dropped off a few hundred metres from the bus station rather than the several thousand away I was dropped off at in Ahmedabad. The state intercity buses were literally old school - which reminded me big time of the chicken buses back in Central America - as they rattled me one and a half hours to my eventual destination of Fardapur.

This was my first hotel stay in India as it was the only cheap-ish place I could find and I hope that subsequent hotels will be better than this one. Though the building looks bright enough, the room is fairly crusty, has no in-room wifi, no hot water (a common theme in Indian accommodations - I was fine going three weeks without a hot shower in South and Central America but that's because it's still steaming hot in the evenings there, unlike here in Northern India) and the toilet was a squat one. So a number two was extremely hard work and it was also the worst time to get my first case of Delhi belly; thankfully this one wasn't

This is the first thing you see when you enter the cave complex proper. Not quite what you expect to see in a set of caves!
actually that bad but I was using the dunny more often than I was hoping to, leaving me with some very sore legs!

The advantage that the hotel did have was the fact it was just a 4km, 60 rupee taxi ride away from the whole reason I had undertaken this mission into the wops; the Ajanta Caves.
Most people haven't heard of these caves but they really are world class. They are basically a set of thirty Buddhist chatiyas (prayer halls) and viharas (monasteries) built into the rock on a horseshoe-shaped gorge overlooking the Waghore River. The caves were carved out in two different time periods; in the 1st and 2nd centuries BC by Satavahana Buddhists; and during the 5th and 6th centuries AD by the Mahayana. Now I have seen cave monasteries before in Turkey; I've seen horseshoe-shaped gorges before in Bulgaria; I have even seen cave monasteries in horseshoe-shaped gorges before in Moldova, of all places. But this may well be the best of the lot. The caves in Cappadocia, Turkey, are just as grand but lack the intricate detail of the carvings here in Ajanta, as well as the colourful 'frescoes' (temperas). The columns and
Cave 1 Paintings
Many of the paintings depict particular scenes of daily life back in the day.
facades evoke Petra, while the carvings aren't a million miles away from the ones seen in Angkor. The size and elaborateness of it all is impressive. The caves do get a bit samey after a while but the site definitely saves the best until last with Cave 26, with its columns, sculptures, shape and lighting. It's real Indiana Jones stuff. The panoramic view from the lookout down onto the caves is magnificent as is the underrated natural scenery of steep cliffs, waterfalls and plateaus. Just a shame I was so tired from fuck-all sleep over the last two nights, as I perhaps didn't enjoy it as much as would've.

I was glad to be getting out of that hotel though and I used the last of my phone credit to book a hostel in my next destination: Mumbai. The only problem was that I hadn't booked any transport there - I was going to catch a bus to Aurangabad and rely on a private bus company to have space in one of their overnight buses going to Mumbai (which I was fairly confident one of them would). I could even possibly catch a same-day train in the afternoon. The

This cave was never finished and inside you can see the techniques used to carve the caves out of the rocks.
bus station, train station and private bus companies are all within a square kilometre in Aurangabad which will make things easier - I don't usually leave things up to chance like this but like I said at the start of this entry, sometimes you take risks. Two days looking for solutions in Udaipur hadn't worked out a plan for me so I couldn't do much worse by winging it here. It's good to add a bit of spice to your life occasionally.

Catching the state bus again to Aurangabad, I arrive at around 2.30pm. I decide to walk to the train station, in an effort to kill time. I had almost certainly missed the same-day train to Mumbai and it would have been by far the most comfortable way to get to Mumbai and I was a little annoyed at myself that I somehow missed booking this connection. This was thanks to a combination of a quirk on the online booking site, deciding to get high on my last night in Udaipur instead of planning ahead and because of a lack of internet at my hotel in Fardapur. There were no spaces left on either of the overnight trains
River & Waterfall
The scenery around the caves was rather impressive too. No wonder these sacred caves were decided to be built here.
to Mumbai that night yet I still waited in the queue, hoping the ticket clerk might be able to work some magic. An hour later and feeling hot and tired among a queue of increasingly tetchy Indian men, I decided to give up - I wasn't likely to get a space on board the trains that night and I was getting sick of standing in that queue. The wait had served is purpose in killing time but there is only so much time one can absolutely waste. And thank God I decided to create online booking accounts to avoid all this bureaucratic hassle. There is a waitlist system that might have got me space on a sold-out train, but it's quite complicated so I'm not gonna explain it here.

Leaving the train station I rock up to the first travel agency that I come to and book a sleeper bus to Mumbai. It drops me off just a fifteen minute walk to my hosteI - easy as you like!
I then decided to make my way to the bus departure point as it was by a shopping mall. I've said many times before that a shopping mall can feel

like a nice, clean and welcoming sanctuary for a weary traveller, providing the homeless with all the temporary amenities one needs. I decided to walk again, getting looks - and help - from surprised locals wondering what the hell a tourist was doing wondering the dusty streets of Aurangabad. Even a short walk of a few hundred metres is a hassle and a challenge in India.
With my wheely backpack, I am always looking for smooth terrain to wheel it over - in India, where ""pavements"" are dusty, dirty, sandy, rocky, gravel-ly or non-existent, this is sometimes impossible and I had to strap the pack to my back several times. It really has not been that much of a problem in either Latin America or Europe but India is a place best tackled by travelling as light as you can.

I was disappointed yet not surprised to find out that the ""shopping mall"" was merely a modern-ish building housing several shops - not the bathroom and eatery laden place I was hoping for - but to get there, I had to wade through a massive fruit and vegetable market. Like many things in India, it was chaotic and cool

Which clears up at night and turns into a bus depot, funnily enough.
at the same time as vendors simply throw down a blanket on what I presumed used to be a car park of some sort, and spread out their produce. It was absolutely packed. The smell of all the herbs was really nice though. I now had to somehow kill five hours here waiting for the bus.

I hadn't seen a single foreigner all day and it isn't always the fun, touristy, backpacker stuff that is the most memorable. I had spent all day riding public transport, walking through streets a tourist wouldn't normally walk through and saw things a tourist wouldn't normally see. While it was a bit of hassle lugging my shit around with me all day, it was nevertheless a real, slightly intrepid last couple of days on my own. Unlike other countries I have visited, it is impossible for any budget tourist not to get caught up in real, everyday India. At this point I was still wholeheartedly embracing it!

I needed to eat something before getting on the bus so I made my way through the chaos with all my shit across the road. There were a few eateries where the options were chicken
Ceiling In Cave 1
I was surprised how intact the paintings were here.
biryani, some dodgy-looking curry and er, chicken biryani. I was weary of getting meat but the place was fairly busy which was a positive sign. Like I said; when travelling sometimes you have to take risks. I had no choice this time.
With my stomach feeling a little ropey, I was hoping to get something that wasn't spicy - something easier said than done here in India. And this biryani was was spicier than most - my stomach was growling already. With an overnight bus to get through, I hoped that my stomach would get through it too.
While cautiously munching through my biryani - a big plate that I managed to get through rather easily in the end - the owner of this tin-roof, street restaurant came over and had a chat. He mainly rambled but he was far from the only local keen on having a chat. You could tell that Aurangabad doesn't get too many tourists as when people talked to me, they were genuinely interested in me rather than my money. Many wondered where I was from such is the rarity of seeing an Asian with a man-bun dressed in Western clothes. I saw a genuine

and friendly side of the local people which was really cool - more than one person approached me on my walk through the dusty streets to ask me where I was going and if I needed help. The owner gave me a discount in the end - definitely can't complain about a ₹60 biryani!

A couple of observations about India:
- The Indian head wiggle. Does it mean yes? Does it mean no? Does it mean maybe? WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!
- There are no supermarkets as Westerners know it anywhere! I guess there is no way a supermarket chain can undercut the already rock-bottom prices offered by the many, tiny, independent general stores everywhere.

Feeling gross, dusty and sweaty, it was now time to get on my bus back to the mega cities of India. Next stop: Mumbai.

Gate of India
Bombay - Die Portugiesen haben es vor knapp 400 Jahren an die Engländer verschenkt, weil König Charles II sich erbarmte, deren Königstochter Katharina zu heiraten. Entweder galt es für die Portugiesen damals einen Krieg zu verhindern oder die Schönheit der Katharina musste mit einer gewaltigen Mitgift etwas unterstrichen werden. Aber das muss uns heute ja nicht mehr interessieren.

Auf einer altersgerechten Vormittagstour durch die 20-Millionen-Metropole haben wir uns ein paar indische Tempel angeschaut, wie überall sind die indischen Gottheiten meist farbenprächtig-kitschig bemalt, viel goldfarbener Glitzer und filigrane Wandstrukturen runden die Häuser ab. Zwischen den Tempeln erleben wir mit unserem Bus im Stau stehend immer wieder das Verkehrsschauspiel. In dem vielen Verkehr, in dem jedes Fahrzeug ständig die Hupe betätigt, um dann doch nur schleppend voran zu kommen, schlängeln sich die Mopeds und wenigen Fahrräder entlang, immer den schnell schmaler werdenden Lücken zwischen zwei Fahrzeugen durch beherztes Einlenken oder Abbremsen knapp entrinnend. Zwischendurch schieben sich fünf Meter lange und drei Meter hoch gepackte Lastenkarren, bespannt mit einem Mann, auf die Straße, um den Vierte-Reihe-Parkern auszuweichen. Noch eins oben drauf legt eine Kuh, die sich von ihrem Strick losgerissen und das Verbot der Stadtregierung von Mumbai missachtend einfach auf die Kreuzung stellt.
Das alte und das neue Taj-Mahal-Hotel
Dann geht plötzlich fast gar nichts mehr. Nur sehr langsam schlängelt sich der Verkehr in respektvollem Abstand um dieses Tier. Eine Blase - eine Insel der Ruhe Inmitten des Verkehrschaos, wo die Kuh gemächlich wiederkäut, die Gegend beobachtet und genüßlich einen Fladen hinterlässt.

Da wir auch mit unserem Bus die Kuh einmal passiert haben, fahren wir zur Besichtigung des Gate of India, welches zur Begrüßung für den englischen König George V. gebaut wurde. Neben dem Gate of India steht ein schönes Hotel, das Taj Mahal Hotel, welches ein Inder, der im Rahmen der Rassentrennung ein „europäisches“ Hotel nicht betreten durfte, mal schnell selbst gebaut hat. Natürlich schöner und besser und toller, als all die „europäischen“ Hotels - das dieser Inder furchtbar reich war, muss hier wohl nicht extra erwähnt werden. Nach der Unabhängigkeit Indiens wachte das Hotel über den Abzug der britischen Armee, welche das Land durch das Gate of India verließen.

Am Abend besichtigen wir noch die verschiedensten Märkte – Chili-Schoten, Goldschmuck, bunte Stoffe, Kühe, Süßigkeiten, Fische und andere Haustiere. In dem Gedränge kann man sich gut treiben lassen und den in der Ferne klingenden Worten der Reiseleitung lauschen. Auf dem Vogelmarkt, der gleich neben dem Fischmarkt
auf Tempelrunningtour
kommt, ist das Geschnatter so laut, dass man von der Geschichte Indiens nichts mehr mitbekommt. Aber so ist das nun mal, wenn sich deutsche Fastpensionäre lautstark über den gammeligen Fischgeruch zwischen den nahen Ständen und den Uringeruch in den Gassen verständigen. Notdürftig bereitgehaltene Taschentücher vermögen den Geruch nur bedingt der Nase vorenthalten. Wenigsten verstummt so mancher, nach frischer Atemluft schnappend, gerade rechtzeitig, um das Hupen zweier durch die Menge brausender Mopeds wahrzunehmen und den Weg freizumachen.

Kann man nur hoffen, dass der erste Tag in Indien für eine nicht nur komische nasenfeindliche Gerüche bedeutet, sondern auch mit einem offenen Lächeln begrüßt zu werden und ein noch strahlenderes zurückzubekommen, sich im Gewühl durch die kunterbunte Welt treiben zu lassen und neue Worte zu erlernen, um abseits des Heimatschiffs durch den Tag zu kommen: Hallo – Namaste, Kaffee – Kofi und Eis – Ice Cream. Danke – Dhanyavad nicht zu vergessen.

Asia » India » Maharashtra » Lonar
August 31st 2016
Published: November 23rd 2016


Daityasudan Temple
Once you start traveling around, if you stay without at least a weekend getaway for 3-4 weeks, you start craving to go to some place the next week. I had barely traveled out of Bangalore until my 2nd or 3rd year in college when my relationship with travel started (I had infrequently visited a few places but nothing major). After that it has just grown and grown. So, what do you do if you are bored and need a change in scenery ? Pick a nearby tourist spot which you have been waiting to visit and just go there (even if you are 2 or 3 folks). In my case, this resulted in visiting the unique Lonar (Crater) Lake in Maharashtra.



A few months back, I and Vivek had registered for a trip with one of Hyderabad travel groups to travel to Lonar lake. Unfortunately, that had been cancelled and since then we had been waiting for another chance. It had been a while since we had been on any trips and so we thought ""Ah! What the hell. Let's just go"". Because of the various trip plans I and Vivek have been involved in, where we ask
During Sunset
a lot of folks and half of them say ""I'm in"" and then most of of them drop out, we had very low expectations. But every once in a while there are these shockers and within 2-3 days of our query mail, about 7-8 folks had agreed and we even finished planning quickly thanks to Ankur whose hometown was at Jalna (not far from Lonar). The final list included Ankur, the one and only Biswadip, Jyothi, Neha, Nishchay, Ravali, Sidhi, Vivek and obviously me. After a few eventful meetings in our conference rooms, we were all set to visit Lonar and Ajanta - Ellora caves.



On the day of boarding our sleeper bus, as expected Vivek was late and boarded the bus at a later point than expected getting Biryani on the way (No the delay wasen't at the Biryani counter). Along with him was his Bengali bro, Biswadip with his Munna Bhai imported body like accent (Sorry Biswadip but you do remind me of him :P). The rest of us had already boarded the bus earlier. We had had our introductions with us getting garden path sentence (you can check it out in wikipedia) gyan thanks
Little Green Bee Eater
to the punny (alias grammar nazi) duo, Neha and Sidhi. After having rations of the biryani brought by Viviek and Biswadip, we decided to play Uno cards. After a lot of wild draw 4s and reverses, we decided to rest up.



The bus was on time the next morning and dropped us at Jalna. Ankur's parents had arranged for a cab to take us to their house. There we freshened up and had our breakfast. The breakfast was delicious and included poha, omlette, some mixture and a few sweets. From there, it was on to Lonar lake in the 10 seater arranged by Ankur. On the way there were fresh grapes available and Biswadip in his full stylish manner bought 3 bunches with a failed attempt at negotiation. The rest of the ride was pretty eventful with different playlists being played continuously by our DJ Vivek da (who drew energy from the grapes he kept devouring). The distance was about 80 kms and though initially the driver kept irritating us by stopping at every other shop we saw on the road, we reached the place around noon. From a view point we could see the whole lake
Black Winged Stilt
reflecting the surrounding crater at the edges and the rest of it completely green. Before going down near the lake, we visited a Daitya Sudan temple nearby where we also got to know the history behind origins of the lake. The temple got its name from Daiyasudan avatar of Vishnu, who killed the demon Lonasur who resided nearby. A guide who lives near the temple gave us all the details of the temple also and showed us some mineral stones (Copper, iron) which reminded us all of our chemistry lessons from school. We even had a debate on calcium carbonate (Remember it has multiple forms - marble, limestone, chalk). He explained us that the crater formed long time back when a meteorite hit the place. The lake has an amazing eco system and also is supposed to have a hidden water source at the bed which continuously supplies water to the lake. It hosts a plethora of flora and fauna (More on that later).



Armed with the knowledge, we decided that before we visit the lake we should finish our lunch. As it was super hot, we decided to first have some sugarcane juice and ice golas.
Sunset at the lake
Breathtaking view of the sunset
Then we drove to the MTDC resort restaurant for lunch. We were pretty hungry and devoured whatever was available there. The food was ok and we took our time sitting in the shade from the blazing sun. The lake is best viewed from below during sunset and so it was then time to trek down. I initially wore my sandals and after going down for about 300 - 400m, realized what a stupid idea that was. Because of the heat and sweat, the sandals became very slippery. I had to go back to our vehicle and change to my shoes. On my way back though, I was able to add quite a few new species of birds to my collection of photos. There were Green Bee-Eaters, Indian Robin (male and female), Sparrows, Black Winged Stilt etc. I finally caught up with the rest of the folks near the lake. We walked further towards a temple and took some time off to enjoy the surroundings. Near the temple there were a troop of langurs which entertained us for a while. While waiting for the sunset, a few of us noticed peacocks, a bit away from where we were. To try and
Oriental White Eye
capture their shots more closely I was interested in walking forward, but the guy near the temple told us it is not very safe. He then told us to keep to the edge of the lake and not wander of into the dense trees. I, Ankur, Jyothi and Neha started walking hoping to quickly spot them clearly and come back. On our way we even found a skeleton of some dead animal which added to the creepiness. But being the courageous souls, we soldiered forward. As we got near the peacock spot, they started running inside (apparently they don't allow others to dance with them). As we had walked quite a bit already, we decided to take the longer route to reach the rest of our group. The walk was serene and beautiful and I was able to find Brahmini ducks, Pond Herons, Wood Sandpipers and so on. As the sunset began, I tried to experiement with my camera which resulted in my first HDR shot. Though I did not know then (HDR involves merging at least 3 different exposure shots during post processing), the shot had come out superbly without a tripod which is not easy. After an enjoyable
Ajanta Caves
walk for an hour or so, we finally joined the rest of the folks and started climbing up. The panoramic view of the lake from the top was no less picturesque. It took about half an hour to absorb the splendor of what we were seeing post which it was time to head back. Such a long walk deserved something to quench the thirst and that turned out to be the buttermilk and lime soda from the MTDC resort.



With songs playing in the background, I slept for quite a while on the way to Ajanta. After we reached the MTDC stay for the night (at around 10 PM or 11 PM), most of us decided to have some of the grapes and mur muri mixture which Ankur had got from his house for dinner as we did not feel like going out to eat. Vivek, Nishchay and Biswadip decided to have a heavy dinner and went out to find some good place to eat. Then everyone slept stating it would be very difficult to get up early the next day otherwise (One of the very few trips I have been in where people just decided to
Ravali, Biswadip and Jyothi
sleep early). I got up early next morning, freshened up and went out to photograph the beautiful garden of the hotel we were staying at. I was able to capture pretty good shots of Oriental White-Eye, Indian Robin etc and some flowers in the garden. The breakfast took time but was pretty decent and once everyone was done, we started towards the Ajanta caves.




The Ajanta caves are about 30 rock cut Buddhist caves which display the exquisite Indian art through the paintings and sculptures. They formed the ancient monasteries and residing shelters for monks and tourists in ancient India. A number of caves have deteriorated and are being reconstructed to preserve our heritage. We visited all the caves and listened to some of the explanations given by guides about the caves. Ravali was deeply engrossed in the history of the caves and kept explaining us the significance of the caves in between. It was a pretty long walk but was interesting overall. Once out, we moved on towards Ellora caves. It was getting late and we quickly finished our lunch outside the caves. By the time we entered, it was almost 4:00 PM with the
Shrine at Ajanta
closing time being 5:30 PM. The Ellora caves are also similar to Ajanta caves except for the fact that while Ajanta caves were purely Buddhist caves, Ellora caves are a mixture of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu caves. It is supposed to be one of the largest rock-cut monastery-temple complexes in the world. The site is supposed to consist of more than 100 caves but only 34 are open to the public. We spent quite some time at the Hindu caves which were ornately carved. One of the caves had a good place to rest where we all sat down and relaxed (Everyone sat as if expecting someone to serve food but unfortunately that did not happen). To reach the Jain caves we had to cross a bridge and by that time the sun was dropping below the horizon. We explored them till sunset and then decided to move out. Ankur then dropped us to the bus boarding point (he was staying at Jalna for a while) and we reached Hyderabad the next day, safe and sound.




Lonar lake is an extremely beautiful place which is a must visit for any traveler. Its environment and wildlife is
Ellora Caves
something to crave for. If not for the weather at the time we went there (it was scorching hot in March), everything else was perfect. The sunset on the lake is a view one would cherish. Lonar is located slightly away from the din of the city. One can stay in the MTDC resort which is right opposite to the crater of the lake. Ajanta and Ellora caves show the skills and mastery of ancient India. The beautifully crafted art displays our rich heritage. Ajanta and Ellora are more of the standard tourist spots and hence, accommodation is not an issue there.



Last but not the least, this trip gave us the ""That's what you think"" reply as an answer for any question for which one doesn't have a comeback for :P It's a recursive reply which will finally fizzle out when either party gets bored. And thus ends my recollection of a great weekend getaway 😊

Asia » India » Maharashtra » Lonavala
July 7th 2016
Published: August 31st 2016


Squirrel
The planning for the long awaited trip with school friends finally gathered momentum when Ajay (Aj) decided to visit India after completing his Masters in Germany. The final list of people stood at Ajay, Bharath, Maina, Safal, Shruti, Smaran, Umesh and Vrinda (including me of course). All the plans were completed and the bus tickets (KSRTC Airavat - Sleep like a baby) got booked when Maina and Vrinda had to withdraw from the trip. The rest of us still ready to take some time off, booked the hotels using the GoIbibo app and were all set for the trip.

Tip: Bharath made us book each day of the hotel (even if same hotel) separately with 3 of us booking on different accounts for better discounts :P Can't complain as it does help 😊



The first destination was Lonavala and the to journey was an overnight one. All of us met at the Majestic bus stand and after all the ""how much you have changed"", ""how Telugu villainish Smaran looked"", ""how short Bharath had grown"" and so on, we boarded the bus. Our trip started in an ominous fashion with us being treated to SRK's Dilwale in the
Karla Caves
bus. Fortunately, the movie was cut short and we did not have to bear the torture of completing it. We kept chatting through the journey trying to fill in the missing pieces after we had parted post 2nd year Pre-University completion. The bus promptly reached our stop on time and Smaran, Umesh and Safal went to get our XUV (booked through Zoom cars) which would be our mode of transport for the next 3 days. While they booked an Uber and left, the rest of us roamed around trying to get to some place to have breakfast. Following Zomato's recommendations, we were on our way to some cafe when we saw a hotel Vishwa on our way which was also on Zomato but not recommended highly. We were hungry and decided to just order Poha there (Maharashtra is famous for it and how bad can it be ?). The restaurant care taker was incidentally a Kannadiga and thus, we happily placed our orders in Kannada. The breakfast was not bad and by the time we were done with our tea, our XUV arrived.



The others decided that we should start to Lonvala and they would have their
Ajay and Safal seeking blessings from Sage Shruti
breakfast on the way. Smaran being the most experienced was our official driver though some of us had our concerns. He had wanted to try out Christ pose on a bike once when he was riding and I was the pillion rider. I had to literally pull him to ensure he did not try to stand (that will haunt you all the time you are mentioned in my blog Smaran :P). But he said that he had become more careful of late and we gave him the benefit of the doubt (Zoom cars had restrictions too which provided further encouragement). On the way we stopped along the highway so that others could have breakfast and also bought some supplies. Our stay for the first day was at Revenir Holidays, a hotel away from the main roads and at a pretty calm location. We reached there pretty early about 10 am when the check-in time was 12 pm. They told us that they could not accommodate us early and thus, we decided to visit Karla caves before checking into our hotel.



Karla caves as any other caves in India had a pathway leading to it whose both sides
Lion's Point
Sunset time
were crammed with local shops. On our way up we ignored them and reached the caves after paying the entrance fees. The caves were well sculpted and had a number of pictures inscribed. They were Buddhist rock cut caves and one of them specifically had a beautiful shrine at the end of a passageway surrounded by sculpted columns. After a brief photo session there, we came out to see a goat tied outside for sacrifice. We felt bad for it but were powerless to do anything. Then outside, we decided to try out our rock climbing skills where I, Smaran and Ajay went up a rocky hill almost to the top. On the way back, Safal and Ajay even took blessings from Sage Shruti who was in deep meditation on a rock (The photo explains it all). With the sun blazing away, all of us were pretty thirsty and made a stop for a glass or two of chilled sugarcane juice. Also, waiting for us was Maganlal chikki shop (It is so common in Lonavala that if you stumble you would probably fall into a Maganlal store). Though we had 2 more days, the idea was that we could try
Lion's Point
out a few options for chikki which we could then buy for home and office. Strawberry chikki proved surprisingly good and was a good way to regain our energy while we had to replace a flat tyre of our XUV. Though our own mech engineer, Ajay was expected to magically replace it with a swish of his hand (What was the point of being a mech engineer if you can't replace a tyre uh ? :P The std Indian household dialogue), the reality was that everyone of us (including Shruti who wanted to prove her prowess by being able to push the level repeatedly to release the healthy tyre) had to work instead of just eating chikki. With the XUV back in shape, we all decided it was time to head back and freshen up at our hotel.



It was a pretty hot afternoon and what better to offset the heat than a dip in the swimming pool ? Revenir holidays had a pretty good swimming pool (though not very clean still good enough) and we took our time there to make full use of the facility. I learnt a bit of floating from Umesh while others
Jumping Japang
raced along the length of the pool while trying to decide who is the fastest. Shruti who was initially very reluctant to get into the pool but once she got in, was all ready to train for the Olympics. After a time well spent in the pool, we retired to our rooms to freshen up. It was almost 4 pm by the time we left for our next sightseeing spot. Before that we wanted to finish our lunch but could not find any place which served lunch at that time of the day. So, we settled for snacks at Krishna All Suites Stay. The food was ok but was very expensive. But the place had a very beautiful garden and we made full use of that taking quite a few photos. From there it was onward to Lion's point. Here Google Maps led us to some random point and told us we were at Lion's point (it was near some empty site filled with plants). Thus, we had to rely on the pre-maps method of asking people around to reach our destination. We fortunately reached before sunset and I got busy clicking landscape shots with full enthusiasm. On seeing a
Matheran
few kids blowing soap bubbles all of us decided to try it out too. Sunset is a great time to photograph stuff and thus, all of us tried out a lot of stuff. Starting with soap bubbles followed by all kinds of jumps and poses, we enjoyed our time there. As the sun set completely with the vanishing orange glow, it was time for us to head back and plan the rest of the night. Armed with some namkeen and Pepsi, we decided to have dinner at our hotel itself and spend time playing cards and other games. Initial part was spent on making fun of Bharath (what else could you possibly need for entertainment other than Bharath's prescence). Post a lot of laughs, bowing to Sage Shruti (multiple times in awe of her enlightened state) and dinner, all of us decided to call it quits for the day.



Early to bed, early to rise ..... We had to rise early but not going early to bed left us groggy in the morning while on the way to Matheran. It was going to be a long day as there are no vehicles allowed for travel at Matheran.
Bumblebee ?
One has to either walk to take horse carts to roam around the place. That rule has gone a long way in keeping the place pollution free and maintaining the forest in its original state. We had our breakfast at one of the Dhabas at the start where the food was pretty decent. Then we started to check off all the view points found at Matheran. The view points offer stunning views of the hills and cities of Maharashtra. First up was Khandala view point which was empty waiting for someone to visit it. Only a lone caretaker was present who had put up a few games for kids to play. From him we realized that Louisa view point (one of the very famous ones) was almost right opposite to us on the other side. Still fresh in the morning we thought, ""Oh what the hell, we can cover that easily"" and moved on. The place also was full of birds as expected of a forest-like area. On the way to our next view point, I found a few including a Red-Whiskered Bulbul and Veriditer Flycatcher. On reaching the point, I spotted a huge bee like insect and got busy
Matheran
trying to get a clear shot of it. Once I was satisfied with the bee-shot, I turned and saw one of the most beautiful panoramic view I've ever seen. Near us, a hill stretched in a step like fashion with a blue expanse behind it comprising of the clouds and the other hills which were half immersed in a white stream of clouds. The image was so stunning that we just stood there for a while and marveled at it. As we continued on our walk, we clearly realized that we had come here at the wrong time. It was scorching hot and one can imagine how it would be at a place where you need to walk for the whole day. But undeterred all of us took our time helped along with the dense forest cover. We covered few other view points one by one including the echo point (as the name suggests you can shout and hear your echo shout back at you), one tree hill (one tree was prominent at the view point) and Charlotte lake. We even ate a few ice golas at one of the view points which tasted awesome in the heat. Finally after
Enjoying the view
a lot of walking here and there we reached our highly anticipated Louisa Point which did not disappoint. It basically has a large boulder formation which is narrowly connected to the main hill and thus, provides a very picturesque view from the top. All of us took our share of our photos there which included SRK, Karate Kid and other random poses. While returning we caught a glimpse of the toy train at the railway station. It was then back to the entrance checkpost as we had to get out before sunset (the place is fully dark and very difficult to navigate through in the dark). I badly wanted to have ice golas again before going back and kept irritating the others asking them to find a shop selling it. Finally just as we were about to reach the checkpost, we found one shop where I had my fill of golas. We bid farewell to the beautiful Matheran and then returned to Lonavala.



Shree Narayani Dham Temple is a pretty popular temple in Lonavala and it was located very close to Revenir Holidays. Thus, we went there at night and found it to be very well built
Louisa Point
and maintained. The place was very clean and the idols were very beautifully crafted. The inner ceilings were stunningly designed to take away one's breath. The puja was very professionally done with style and with that we sought blessings and came out. On the way back we also purchased all the chikkis we needed on our return again at a Maganlal's shop. We got a huge variety from chocolate to dry fruit and a few even got Bhakarwadi (a popular eatable) packs.



Next morning, all of us had breakfast at Revenir itself (first day we had to miss as we had to leave early). We consciously tried not eating a lot (though delicious) as our plan for the day was Adlabs Imagica, a theme park popular for roller coasters. Only Bharath had his fill as he was skipping the last day to make use of his credit card points (He had booked a flight back as he had accumulated a lot of points). It was 11 or so by the time we reached Imagica. Initially our thinking was that ""how long would a queue be"" (we had gone there on a National Holiday) and thus, we bought
Veriditer Flycatcher
normal tickets assuming we will have time to finish all the rides. Oh boy were we in for a shocker. The first 2 hours resulted in just 1-2 rides post which we immediately course-corrected and upgraded our tickets to express ones which helped us arrogantly jump to the front of every queue. As for the rides, some of them were just amazing. All of us have been to WonderLa in Bangalore which is one of the largest amusement parks in India. But that lacks in good roller coasters (has only a partly ant-hill coaster which even kids would find boring) and Imagica makes up for it big time. Nitro and Deep Space deserve a special mention as they blew our minds. Deep Space was a sudden shocker as none of us expected it to be so good. It was completely in the dark and while we expected a simple ride, we were treated for a super high-thrill ride. There were a few other shows with special effects such as Mr. India and Cinema 360 which were pretty unique and enjoyable experiences. By the time we were out, none of us had any regrets for taking the express tickets. We had
Sunset Colours
Lion's Point
thoroughly enjoyed the whole day (Safal more than others but that's better kept private).



I had been waiting for an opportunity to go to Lonavala and Matheran from quite some time now. Though the place would be even more beautiful during monsoon season, it is stunning even during the off-season. One just has to be ready to bear the heat and plan the travel well. Lonavala has become pretty crowded with more and more tourists while Matheran has been able to maintain a pollution free forest like environment. I can't wait to check em out during monsoon 😊 Till date I had heard mixed reviews of Adlabs Imagica and am very surprised about it. It is slightly expensive no doubt but is a kickass place with unique rides and shows.



In the end, a fun re-union and a great weekend 😊

June 18th 2016

Foggy sunrise on the way to Kajrat
As it had been a while since my last outing with office folks, I and my ever-ready trek buddy, Vivek planned a weekend getaway to Rajmachi in Maharashtra through the Hyderabad Trekking Club (HTC). This time, our old trip pal, Aditya Vaish (recently married) was very zealous to come with us as he had finally obtained the permission to go for a short weekend trek. Along with him, Sulbha and Anuvrat joined us in their usual style taking more than a month to decide how many among their friends would come along, the final count being 0. This again as always led to us calling our trek organizer umpteen number of times before finalizing the exact number. Ankur, Nishchay and Firoza were the newcomers in our trekking group while Nikhil too decided to join probably as his last as his last trek as a bachelor. Jatin from our Papikondalu trip had also registered separately for this.



With everyone geared up and excited, we met at the Lingampally station to catch the train to Karjat. Vivek was the center of attraction initially with him entertaining everyone during the introductions. All the excitement died down for a while once we
Kondana Caves
met the trek co-ordinators and were told that we did not have enough seats in the train and would have to adjust with a few RAC's. After moving up and down the bogies for a while, I and Nishchay finally sat down to share an RAC seat. I shall not get into the details of how we had to adjust to sleep, but suffice to say that we did not sleep much. This was not unexpected as it is not easy to book train tickets and a few others from the trek group were also in a similar situation.



Sunlight started tickling in through the windows and as soon as I peeked out of my window, I scrambled to get my camera ready. The scene was that of a farmland with the plants near the tracks clearly visible and then the visibility slowly decreasing outward due to fog giving it a ghost-town like appearance. The sun was a small orange ball slowly rising above the farm, its orange hue not spreading too wide again hampered due to the fog. After this we got up one by one and kept waiting for the station to arrive. At the
Glistening wings
Dragonfly
station, Harish our trek lead, asked us to get refreshed and have our breakfast in half an hour. Aditya and Nikhil had started chanting ""Vada Pav"" by now and went to fulfill their craving. Then we went to a restaurant where we ordered a bunch of stuff like poha, missle pav etc and shared them between us. With the mention of poha, Sulbha wanted jalebi (How can one have poha without Jalebi ? :-O) and that too was fulfilled from a store opposite to the restaurant. With us now again in high spirits, we bought a few things for our trek and then walked to find autos which would drop us at the base of our trek.



Once near the base of the trek, we got to know the rest of our trek team. Harish asked us to introduce ourselves in the HTC way, speak out ""Sagani, Sagani, Sa, Pa, Pa"" (still don't know what that means but I am suspicious as Sagani in Kannada means Cow dung) and co-ordinate a simple step with each of the word which the rest of the team follows. It was a good way to get warmed up and get to
Giant Wood Spider
know the rest of the folks. We then set out to Kondana caves which was not too far from where we started. The path was not very difficult but with the sun blazing down on us, it was tiring. Each of us were carrying at least 2 litres of water as we already knew it would be pretty hot. There was a film crew near the caves who were having a lunch break and had a buffet spread out there. We first went to check out the caves which were Buddhist caves carved out of rock. There was also supposed to be a waterfall which had gone missing due to lack of rainfall with only a trickle of water falling down from the top. After clicking a few photos, we decided to have lunch there.



The trek was pretty scenic even in the heat, though during monsoons it would be even better and greener. The plan was to get to a housing area near the base of the Rajmachi fort by evening. On the way we stopped at a spot where there was supposed to be a stream. On climbing a few rocks we found the start
At the top
of the stream. Everyone set out to fill their water bottles only to realize that to fill a whole bottle it would take about about 20 minutes at the pace water was dripping. During that time, I had located a dragonfly with its wings glistening in the sun, a Giant Wood Spider and a Signature Spider to add to my insect photo album. Throughout the rest of the trek, we kept singing, listening to songs until we finally reached the place near to our resting spot for the night. The last 500m or so, we had to cover in the dark as the sun had already set. We walked with flashlights and finally reached our house. All of us drank our share of water and once refreshed, sat outside to hear Vivek's stories. We had built up his reputation from our previous trips as a master story teller and everyone was eager to catch a glimpse of his prowess in the field. But with 10-15 eyes on him, he was not able to perform under pressure and a lot of folks were disappointed. By then a campfire had been arranged nearby and everyone were happy to take continue our activities
Sunrise
there as it was pretty cold by then. At first we started with Antakshari. We got to listen to a few talented folks sing and Aditya who kept shouting ""Yo yo Honey Singhhh"" for anything that started with ""ya"". When ""DJ wale babu"" was sung, Sulbha (who knew only one line) kept chiming in with ""Gaana baja doo"" in her dreamy tone. Then we decided to have DJ music with some dance. After playing a few songs and changing the DJs, we headed back to have our dinner at the house. The housekeeper had made a delicious southern style dinner which we devoured ravenously. Once the dinner was done, all of us got ready to sleep as we had to get up early to reach the Rajmachi fort before sunrise. There were debates as to who would sleep where which got decided easily when Harish intervened and fixed the spots. I had forgotten my blanket and the extra one I got from one of my fellow trekkers was more of a kitchen uniform than a blanket. That then started a string of jokes which kept us laughing and awake for the next 20 minutes. Once Nikhil was able to control
Through the leaves
his laughter, one by one we dozed off.



Early morning, even before the sun had started to come up, we got up and quickly got ready to head to the fort. We covered the rocky areas using torchlight. The climb was decently steep (nothing dangerous unless you are careless) and we quickly progressed to the top. At the top, we found a few trekkers who had camped there through the night. We waited there for a while for the sunrise taking group photos in the meantime. As the sunrise started, we explored more of the fort. The fort was beautiful and peaceful with a lot of greenery around even at this time of the year. We were able to see a very picturesque view of the Ulhas river surrounded by the hills with the sun rising from its sides. We roamed there for a while and then descended back to the house to get ready to leave. On the way back, we went to the Kalabhiravi temple at whose entrance we got cut cucumbers and lemon juice. Depending on our religious beliefs few of us did not go in as we had not had our bath. Once
Fort
back, we got our breakfast (poha) and then started our trek back to our starting point. This turned out to be pretty fast and we reached the place in no time. From there, we took the autos back to Karjat to wait for our train. All of us had Ice golas and juice near the station which was very refreshing.



Then I suddenly realized that my new phone was missing from my pocket. I searched for it everywhere and realized that the only way I could have lost it was that it slid out of my pocket in the auto or fell on the way to the auto near our starting point of our trek. I went to the auto stand with Ankur and checked with them and they said they will check the autos out and let us know. I was totally in a dilemma as to whether go back to the starting point of the trek and look for it or leave it and catch the train. I even thought of staying there till evening and then book a bus to Hyderabad if possible. But thankfully miracles do happen and the auto folks came near
Sunrise
the hotel we were at and gave me back my mobile. I shook the auto guy's hand frantically thanking him for doing such a good deed. But he just kept looking at me as if i was some mad guy. They finally asked me for money when I realized he didn't care whether I thanked him with a handshake or not, but just wanted some money which I happily gave. I was just thrilled to have my phone back.



That ended most of the action in our trip and the rest of it was just the usual wait for the train and then back to Hyderabad after a weekend well spent.



Rajmachi was a good experience and another place ticked off the list of beautiful places in India. I would suggest that you visit it during monsoons as it would be greener and much more beautiful. The trek though not very tough was pretty tiring due to the heat and I am guessing you would find a few waterfalls here and there too during monsoons. Thanks to HTC for organizing this.

PS: To the rest of the trekkers whose name I have not
Along the fort
mentioned here, I'm sorry as I am not good at remembering names. Do friend me on fb and keep in touch 😊.

Leaving Nepal we encountered some of the bureaucracy that this area of middle Asia is known for. The number of stamps needed post X-ray, the number of searches, the number of people to check the stamps and so on. None of us have ever had a bag search at the steps leading onto the plane!
We're at Mumbai airport and Cas is off getting food for Tom and Hat, Bob and Ed are deep into a game of chess.
Earlier today we walked into Indra Chowk and found five toiletry shops, one of which had a good bristle shaving brush. Ed and Hat also picked up their self designed T shirts.
I rounded up at couple of taxis and we were off to the airport, we had the windows down as it was hot and the taxi's were old and you could feel that the smog was quite thick in your chest.
The monsoons arrive around the middle of June and the first burst came as we were just 5 minutes from the station, it was great that it hadn't impeded any part of our tour of Nepal.
We all have long waits for our onwards flights from Mumbai, our's is

4 hours, but Bob and Tom's is a whopping 8 hours. However, given the way our third connection works, we'll all get home around the same time. It's going to be around 24 hours of travelling, so there may be some raised voices and tears.

Hi all,

Tuesday 31st May – Bangalore to Pune

Now Uni was done I was back on tour with work! I had to be up at 5am to catch an 8.10am flight. We left at 5.30am and was at the airport for 6.45am, still a ridiculous amount of time given the time of the morning and the actual distance from my apartment to the airport. For once… my flight was on time! I was so tired I slept on the plane… we had to stop at Hyderabad on the way, bit of a detour but not many direct flights from Bangalore to Pune. And then I heard that the next stop after Pune was Goa! I was tempted to stay on the plane J The flight was remarkably uneventful, NOBODY talked to me (I guess I was asleep!) and I didn’t fall out with anyone.

Pune airport was interesting… obviously military (even if you hadn’t seen all the jets) and quite basic. I got my bags, found my driver and was taken to the office. Which was incredible, on a big campus with everything you could need. I want to stay there next time. I had a great day as always, the teams I visit are so kind and welcoming and look after me so well.

After work I went to the JW Marriott in Pune which is a really nice hotel. The check in was swift, I got offered drinks on arrival, I got help to get to my room, I was told where everything was. I chilled for a bit then went to get a foot treatment as my feet were suffering from wearing open shoes the whole time and me not having time to look after them properly so they were quite sore. I think the Spa there was the most amazing spa I’d ever been to (I’ve been to a few). It was like a haven, I wish I’d taken a picture. The foot treatment was so nice, I took my book but the therapist made me put it down and relax. It was so good I had a facial too! Next job was the gym. I have missed exercise so so much… I haven’t been properly since I got sick in the UK before leaving and it was too hard to do here around work and Uni. The gym guy was very helpful and quite interested in what I was doing (a new regime Brian has got me into). Then it was room service dinner… and bed. I was so tired.

Wednesday 1st June – Pune to Mumbai

I was back out to the office early and worked until 2 before I had to leave for the airport. It was another great day and I’m so humbled by everyone I meet in the offices, they’re so professional and kind. I had to leave at 2 to get to the airport for my flight to Mumbai. I wanted to stay a bit longer in Pune… it had a nice feel to it. It had been the British Raj’s weekend retreat from Mumbai, like Shimla was from Delhi, because of the cool temperatures. The people I was meeting with told me that temperatures had gone up in Pune by 15 degrees in 10 years, crazy. I’ve written about this for Uni… how the wests industrialization and development has created problems for the world… that the west is now trying to address. But, for developing countries it means they miss out on the economic growth the west benefitted from. Anyways…. have to remember I have finished Uni! J No need to write an essay!

I was so tired I slept on the way to the airport :/ I checked in and got settled at the gate. I nearly ended up on the wrong plane… a plane started boarding from our gate AFTER the time we were supposed to. It was a good job they checked else I’d have been off to Chennai! I wasn’t the only person turned away for making the same mistake…

The flight was supposed to be 20 minutes, no time for a snack, but it took 40 because of Mumbai’s air traffic control. I liked Mumbai on arrival… felt nice and vibrant. My driver looked (and acted) about 12 years old (he was very excitable and enthusiastic but very nice). It took 1 ½ hours to get to the hotel, we had a crash which involved some swearing but all was well.

I had booked into a hotel that will remain nameless as a trial… the people were so nice but it started going wrong when I realised after going to the gym I was in a smoking room and had to apply some pressure to get moved. Then my dinner was horrible, but I ate it anyway and it made me sick the next day. The room felt damp and honestly the whole place just felt random. I couldn’t put my finger on it but I didn’t like it, I felt uneasy. Still I slept well… and in a break from tradition in Indian hotels they handily have all the light switches with labels on the bedside table. I’d had to play hunt the light switch in the posh hotel the night before.

Thursday 2nd June – Mumbai

I woke up… had breakfast and hit the gym. I fell asleep on the journey to work again… I don’t think I’m eating enough on this new exercise regime but it’s hard being away in hotels. I had a really nice day with lovely people. I really enjoyed sitting in the office as Mumbai’s famous commuter trains could be heard rumbling past… (and I could see them if I looked out the window at the right time). They’re famous for being a bit busy and crazy… I could see people hanging out the doors. I’ve been told that if you stand 5 metres away from the door you won’t have to walk onto the train… you just get kind of carried in by the crowd. One of my colleagues told me he took his child on one and it was terrifying.

I stayed until 7 and on the way home the highlight was Skyping Gemma and the children from the car. My driver loved that… being involved in a call with the UK! And then I re-entered the twilight zone (the hotel!). I decided to eat before the gym… had a nice time but it was all just so random again… I got asked 3 times to clarify my dinner order was ok as did I know it had x and x in when it’s a pretty standard dish (like saying did you know spaghetti bolognaise has spaghetti in it). I got approached once, the waitress looked at me petrified then walked off. I got given a new room key just in case mine was broken. And when I got in the lift the porter showed me the way… didn’t touch the lift but still it was already selected for the right floor. By the time I was done for the night I was so tired I slept from 10.30 through to 9am!

Friday 3rd June – Mumbai

The team I’m visiting in Mumbai work UK hours, so don’t start until 12.30. I therefore had time for breakfast - another mishap, asking for a plain omelette and ending up with one with ONIONS in… it could have had ANYTHING else in it but onions… really! (I’m allergic to them if you didn’t know…!). The gym was good, the gym guy was helpful again but trying to get me to change to a new programme and I was like no… I am happy with this one and as I’m only here for another day I’m not sure your one will really be helpful to me… I arrived back in the room to get ready for work to find the attendant about to clean it… I asked him to wait 30 minutes until I left. 10 minutes later… I was in the shower and I heard the doorbell go… I shouted out “NO, NOT NOW” and jumped out to lock the bathroom door. Then I swear I heard the door open and with horror realised that for some reason in Indian hotels the wall between the bathroom and bedroom is open (either completely open or like this one see through glass) so I dived out of the shower again and closed the flimsy curtain. Anyway out of the shower, 5 minutes later the attendant was back again so I gave up and let him in, getting a nice compliment on my outfit.

My driver was late today… because he’d had another crash (I’m sensing a theme here!). I had another really good day at work. The Indian people are amazing, they work so hard, longer days than we do in the UK and successfully manage work and home life despite the long hours and longer travel time. The extended family is important and the hours people get up to provide for their family is amazing, I admire them and really feel I could learn from them.

I left work at about 8.30 and was back at the hotel for 9.15. On the way home I sat watching the goings on and thought this is so random but so nice, I’m in Mumbai! On my own, doing work, feeling quite comfortable.

On the list for tonight was gym and food. Then sleep. There were no further mishaps…

Saturday 4th June – Mumbai to Nashik

I had time for one final gym session at the hotel… then checked out and left for the airport to meet Jane, Sharon, Lisa and some others for a visit to the Sula vineyards in Nashik… (it was arranged as my end of Uni celebration!)

I had a nice driver take me to the airport… I had to stop at an ATM and he insisted on escorting me. And then I asked him if I could sit up from so I could take photos which he seemed to enjoy… I got a bit of a tour… including him pointing out the HUGE water pipes that provide Mumbai’s drinking water. They were massive but I wasn’t quick enough to get a picture (I got some later on the journey to Nashik because we followed them for miles).

I met Jane, Sharon, Lisa, Dennis and Mary at the airport and we got in two cars for the 2 ½ hour drive to Nashik. It was really good to catch up with Jane and Sharon and the journey was interesting, the landscape was a mixture of green and barrenness, almost burned ground. There was one part where we went up really high and the drive was a bit nerve-wracking because we saw several accidents and the drops of the side were pretty steep! There were nice views though and we saw some really old classic trains.

We arrived at the Sula Vineyards which looked pretty hectic and were diverted 3KM down the road to Beyond By Sula, where we were staying. The road was a bit rough and bumpy but when we arrived it was definitely not rough. The place was smart, with an infinity pool and nice views over the vineyards and into the valley below. Sharon and I were sharing and after a quiet lunch with a bottle of Sula Brut (the fizz) we settled by the pool. It didn’t take long for Jane and I to be tempted to get in for a swim, the water was lovely.

Later on we head back to the vineyards for our tour with some of Lisa’s friends who had joined us, which was interesting, although we were more interested in the wine tasting… (I’d been persuaded off the health plan for a day… don’t tell Brian J he’ll never read this).After wine tasting we had dinner and a really good restaurant and couldn’t believe how cheap it was. It was then back to the hotel for a drink… at which point Jane went to bed and Sharon and I hit the local bar… which took a while to find and was a bit random but worth the trip. We left there at about 1am and slept well!

Sunday 5th June – Nashik to Mumbai to Bangalore

We were up quite early considering! Brian had asked if was hungover (I had to fess up about the day off the health kick J I cannot lie to him) and I actually wasn’t. We had a nice breakfast and sat by the pool for a while then left at 11am to drive back to Mumbai. I missed most of the journey because I was asleep, as Jane said… I must have needed it!

In Mumbai we went to the Taj Mahal Palace on the seafront near the historic Mumbai Gate for afternoon team. It was a really big old style hotel, very smart. I think it was the scene of a terror attack years before so I don’t think it’s been back open that long. We were overlooking the sea and had a lovely selection of sandwiches, snacks and cakes. Then we went for a walk along the seafront which wasn’t as lovely as it could have been because it was so crowded. I wanted a good picture of the Mumbai Gate but it involved a big queue and we didn’t have the patience.

The drive from the hotel back to the airport was really nice… it was coming into evening (my favourite time to be travelling) and we seemed to keep going in circles because we kept ending up at the seafront… but I think that’s just because of how Mumbai is located on a kind of peninsula. The sea front was so so busy and it was just nice watching the goings on. The water was a bit choppy!

I had to say bye to the others at the airport which I was a bit sad about. They were all going to Delhi, me back to Bangalore.

Love and miss you all a lot.

Rach Xx

May 7th 2016

As the title suggests we weren't overly impressed with Mumbai. I've been here before on my previous trip and only stayed one night because it's that bad. The train station is in the top 10 things to do! Followed by a park...etc you get the picture.

Already knowing there wasn't much to get up to other than spend money, we'd planned to be in and out in a day.



We arrived from Pune around 11pm and headed to Colaba, the tourist district. This is home to the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, and for just £400 per night you can have a royal experience. Of course, if you're on a budget you could always stay in one of the cheaper £200 per night rooms situated OUTSIDE of the actual palace. I'm fairly certain (The internet had gone down at the time of writing) that this was also the location for the 2008 Mumbai attacks, as such the whole area is on lock down.



I stayed in this area on my last trip at “Red shield guest house” or the salvation army as it's commonly known. The bunks are 350rs and a basic double room is 1300rs. Luckily as we were discussing the prices etc a bloke from the street popped his head through the door and told us of a place down the road with a double for 700rs, so I went to check it out. After the man had tried (and failed! Terrible deal) to sell us some ganja we took the room at hotel Prosser's.



Looking in the guide book for things to do, your options are very limited, despite Mumbai having it's own chapter in the guide book! The Elephanta caves are the only thing that look interesting, especially having been told they rival the caves at Ellora and Ajanta. It's not a bad place, it's just that it doesn't have anything you can't find in any other city in the world. There's nothing special about it.

So we went to check out the caves at Elephanta, an hours boat ride away. It would've taken about 20 minutes had the boat not been a piece of garbage! They were that old I reckon the ancients used the same ones!



While I'd been seeing my friend in Pune, Dave had been over to Ellora and Ajanta. The ones at Elephanta aren't anywhere near as good. There's only one caves that's impressive! The boat ticket to the island is 180rs return for “luxury”....I don't think there's actually a difference, you just get on the boat. Then when you arrive on the island there's a 5rs “tourist tax” I'm sure that's not a thing. THEN! They wanted 500rs entry, luckily the guy heard me complain of the price compared to Indians (30rs) and he gave us the tickets for 350rs each.

Unless you really like ancient caves I wouldn't bother going. Like I said there's only one cave that's good, the others have been started and left unfinished, like lots of ancient caves here. One of them, the last one, was literally a normal cave with a Shiva phallus inside!



Needless to say we got out as quickly as possible. We'd been trying on Cleartrip (India's version of the trainline site) to book a ticket from Mumbai to Satna for three days, even been to the train station in Pune, to no avail.

We got the ticket straight away in Mumbai, at the latest time we'd tried. I think some stations and cleartrip don't have access to the foreign tourist quota of tickets.



From Satna we have to get a three and a half hour bus ride to Khajuraho, to see some ancient Karma Sutra temples.



While wondering around Mumbai waiting for the train we stumbled across a shop selling chocolate hobnobs! A silver lining in an otherwise drab few days.





In other news we've booked a flight from Kolkata to Myanmar for 29th May. Just over three weeks left in India!

A beach in Goa
Geo: 20.5312, 75.7487

Riding the train, Kochi to Goa

This started well with an air con compartment with 4 beds to ourselves, which we thought we had booked in its entirety, so we were rather horrified when incessant loud banging at 2.00 am woke us and the conductor turfed Peter out of his bottom bunk for an Indian man to join us, and another arrived later about 6.00. It was a bit intimate, Indian style, and we were decidedly unfriendly, being used to more personal space and privacy. Surprisingly this shabby train with dirty windows and toilet rated highly on the India railways survey, confirming that standards of cleanliness are entirely relative.

We worked out from the timetable that it would be better to get off the train at the 2nd Goa station,which Peter explained to the conductor who said the minimum extra cost would be for 300 kilometres.. Then he asked Peter to step outside into the corridor and suggested a bribe of ten pounds would cover it, presumably straight into his pocket.

We stayed in a lovely old family house in Goa inherited by the hostess and filled with wonderful paintings and artifacts. Her husband had been president of the Sheraton group
and sunset
so used to running hotels. It was great to be joined that evening by Helen and Stephen, travelling from Chennai and we celebrated with an expensive meal, by local standards. The coconut palm fringed, long beach at Candolin was wonderful, with beautiful warm sea, firm shelving sand, shacks all along the beach for beers at sunset, together with a pool at our house for afternoon swims . Such a nice place it has become a destination for lots of middle aged and older European hippies. 2 days of late breakfasts, a trip to old Goa and walks to the beach flew by before we were all off to the airport for a flight via Mumbai to Allamabad to drive the next day to Ajanta

Visiting the caves involved a long car journey of 2 hours each way, which was full of local life through a farming community. According to locals you need a lot of luck when driving in India. It's certainly an entertainment. There are vehicles of all sorts, lorries laden with huge loads, buses crowded with hot passengers, impatient tourist cars trying to overtake, always white, occasional private cars, large numbers of tuc tucs, motorbikes and scooters, particularly
the Portugese Cathedral in Old Goa
in the cities, then carts of all descriptions. Then there are the animals ; bullock carts taking their time, dogs lying around all over the place, wild boar snuffling in the gutter, an occasional camel tethered or ridden down the street and cows wandering at will all over the road. Mix in the local population using the street as their workshop to make things, to load and unload goods, to sell from shops and carts, to walk along and across the street negotiating the traffic. In the cities, particularly in a tuc tuc it's quite good fun if bumpy and uncomfortable, on the long distance roads at speed it can be quite scary.he paintings and carvings of Buddha in the Ajanta caves were spectacular and worth the long journey through the cotton and vegetable farming villages. Martin Smith and his wife from Norfolk, who is the great grandson of the British Officer who discovered the caves in 19th century while on a tiger hunt, were there at the same time, surrounded by staff and cameras. It's a hot walk along the valley lined with 29 cave temples and monasteries dating back to BC dates, with lots of shoes off and
and another of their lovely churches
on to enter the most religious ones.

Mumbai is a strange & fascinating mix of celebration & disaster! Though, this is quite true for all of India but it’s adequately obvious in the ‘Maximum City’.



It’s full of people – starlets, dreamers, fantasizers. It houses India’s most prolific film industry & some of Asia’s biggest slums. Mumbai is exactly like it is portrayed in Bollywood movies. It’s jazzy & glitzy & then hard at times.



The city has maddening energy & amazing of all, everyone seems quite settled with this fusion.



On 12th Feb’16, as I stepped out of the Mumbai Airport after an early morning flight from Delhi, I was greeted by palm trees (precisely, 3 trees 😉) & warmer humid (not so much though) winds & for a moment I thought I was in Goa 😉 However, 5 minutes into the city & I realized this is nowhere close to Goa. & that I was already in love with it!! <3 <3



I took a pre-paid taxi to Colaba, where I was supposed to stay for next 3 days, for about 500 bucks, which took about 45 minutes.



Space is a luxury in Mumbai. This is quite apparent from the grilled balconies of almost all residential apartments. Mumbai has no concept of open balconies. & the buildings are literally marching towards the roads, & will surely take them over some day. At some points, I wanted to push away the buildings so that I could breathe some more.



However, as my taxi entered in Colaba I could finally breathe & smell the sea. I was quite happy with the choice of my hotel (Hotel Diplomat - ~6K per night) & location. Though expensive, Colaba is the best place to stay. There are numerous eating joints & café’s; one can never go hungry there. If anyone’s motto in life is ‘Eat Eat Eat and then eat some more’ (like me 😉) Colaba streets are the best streets to be in!



For all non-veg lovers, butter chicken & kebabs at ‘Bademiyan’ are a must try, though be ready for at least a 20-minute wait line. Café Leopold, the historic café now post Mumbai attacks, is always bustling with people. Café Churchill, a quiet little café, on Colaba Causeway (which is also a paradise for shopaholics!), is best for people wanting some peace & silence. I loved the chicken pasta & cold coffee served to me at this café.



The city never sleeps. It was only about 9 in the morning & as I was being driven from the airport to Colaba, I could see vegetable ‘mandis’ installed & ready for business, women weaving baskets, people grabbing quick breakfasts at the street vendors .. ! The city is like up at 9 and up till 4 in the morning. The 1st night in my hotel, I could hardly grab any sleep because of all the Mumbaikars who aim to party harder than they work 😉 ‘Social Colaba’ was right under my hotel room & was alive till 4 AM. The city surely knows how to live!



The ‘Gateway of India’ and the historic ‘Taj’ were about 20 steps from my hotel. The entire stretch of the road next to the sea that leads to Marine drive & Chowpatty is on a steam all night. I was walking down towards my hotel from Chowpatty and was amazed to look at my watch which said it was almost midnight. It only seemed like late evening.



The Bandra-Worli Sea link that leads to Haji Ali & Carter Road is a master piece and is best viewed at night. Carter Road is a great place to hang out & eat or to just sit & watch the sea come & go!



But ‘Real Mumbai’ is best viewed & understood on its slow local or in its ‘kali-peelies’ (taxis / local cabs). Nothing covers the city like its local! I boarded the local from CST (earlier called Victoria Terminal), which is authentically pretty. The local took me to the other end of the city, Vashi, in about an hour. While on the local, I could visualize how the city is a straight line with the local being its backbone.



Even before I knew it was time for me to bid good-bye to the city, 3 days were definitely not enough. I already want to go back to the city & live it a little more, for its people, its hidden gems, the shopping, the food, the travel....and of course the experience!

Asia » India » Maharashtra » Malshej Ghat
February 17th 2016
Published: February 17th 2016


Offbeat
Malshej Ghatis a mountain pass nestled in the towering rough hills of the Western Ghats. The mountain pass is about 150 KM from Mumbai & 130 KM from Pune. I got a chance to drive down to Malshej Ghat from Mumbai & the 3 hours long drive was one of the best experiences of my life ever!

The majestic Western Ghats have narrow, curvy road with deep valleys & numerous blind spots & sharp turns. Thankfully, the roads are well-made, especially the one that led us to Malshej Ghat from Mumbai. The continuous elevated crest of mountains and hills offer breathtaking view of nature. Driving along the Western Ghats in the midst of clouds, dense fog & greener-than-green valley is a blessing for any outdoor enthusiast.

It is definitely more about the journey than the destination itself!

Malshej offers a striking view of the valley, particularly from behind the ‘Flamingo Hill Resort’, run by MTDC, which is also a great place to stay & spend a relaxed weekend. It is a paradise in the monsoons, when the valley comes alive with green hills, waterfalls and exotic flamingoes. Malshej is known for its dark woods & the animals living
The drive
inside. There are also several trekking trails in the surrounding hills on offer for the adventure lovers.

So today is the last day of a busy, diverse and very Indian tour. It would be great fun to continue, but the other places to see will have to wait. I am sure I will be back in India, perhaps back to Ladakh. There was plenty of inspiration for other trips in the museum today. On the trip with our guide this morning it was a mixture of culture and architecture. The architecture included the university and the main station. We couldn't do the guided tour inside the admin block of the station because it wasn't available due to government holiday. We saw the outside and the ticket hall. The cultural side was the laundry, the tiffin boxes and the fishing village. These are like you see in the documentaries. The laundry was the best, to see all the men working hard slapping the clothes and ironing huge piles of clothes. There were many pairs of jeans, so this method of washing is probably good for jeans. We drive up to Malabar hill for the view down over the beach and marine drive.

We were dropped at the main museum. This has a very good sculpture collection and a well displayed and explained indian miniature painting collection. The exhibits here were much better displayed and lit than most of the museums.

Dinner was at the Taj Palace hotel. This is a 5 star luxury hotel, so it was not what we are used to. It was bigger than I expected. Near our table was a sophisticated New York former dancer travelling on his own. He was interested in talking about his trip, but not very interested in ours.

The visit to Elephanta Island was a relaxing way to start the visit to Mumbai. The boats to the island leave from the gateway to India. This is next door to the Taj Palace hotel. This is the hotel that was bombed and has been rebuilt. There was a very pleasant breeze on the boat, but it was very smoggy so there was no view of the coastline. The air pollution was a news item. It has been made worse by a fire at a rubbish dump.

On the way to the Island we passed an oil tanker, a huge beast, and an old fashioned fishing boat, small fry. Elephanta island was named by the Portuguese because they saw an elephant sculpture on the island. The island still has a thin belt of mangroves. Generally Mumbai is not a green city so it was pleasant to see the trees and the monkeys. Some of the. Onkeys were playing on the souvenir stalls, probably trying to find the lunch boxes.

Some of the sculptures in the cave were damaged by Portuguese soldiers who may have used them as target practise. I had our guide to myself because unfortunately Ginnie was unwell. She was very good at telling the Hindu myth stories and the morals that underlie them. One sculpture is undamaged. It has three faces representing different forms of Shiva. The caves are a similar age to the Badami caves and the Hindu caves at Ellora.



On the boat on the way back I chatted to a couple from north London who are staying at the Taj Palace. Their trip is very different with lots of service and they haven't had Indian food.

Ginnie was well enough for a short walk in the late afternoon. We saw some of the colonial buildings, particularly art deco buildings. Many of them reminded me of English town hall architecture. I found a large English language bookshop and had fun browsing.

I have been looking forward to Ellora and it didn't disappoint. We first visited the Jain temples which are the latest in date. These temples have many similarities with the earlier Hindu temples. In these temples the detail of the carving of the pillars stands out. There are urns and shields which look almost European in style. This is possibly due to some influence from Greece, though I might be wrong about that.

The Hindu temples are the most impressive,particularly two caves. One has very large sculptures, cave 26. My particular favourite here was Ravenna lifting Mt Kailas. Unusually in this cave there is a Nataraja or dancing Shiva executed badly with wrong proportions. If it was the work of an apprentice, they would have failed that assignment. the biggest cave looks like a huge temple surrounded on all sides by cliffs of rock. It is not a building built from the ground up, but rock carved from the top down. This is the largest monolithic carving in India. It is in the shape of a chariot, although there is some damage, its glories still remain. It wasn't easy to photograph, but the scale of the structure can just about be seen on the blog photo.

The final group of temples is Buddhist and the oldest at Ellora. These temples are simpler. One of them stands out for several reasons. It has a roof carved in stone to look like wooden beamsAnd at the end of the long hall is a simple elegant Buddha. This is the chanting temple with a very good acoustic. Our guide had a very good voice and gave us a very atmospheric chant.

After a late lunch there was time for a visit to the Daukatab fort. This included a route to enter the fort through a dark passage with no natural lighting. This was to confuse the enemies. The fort was taken many times, but by hunger siege rather than direct attack.

We arrived in Mumbai late in the evening. The flight was short, but it took nearly as long as the flight for the airport to find a ramp to get us off the plane. Mumbai seemed modern and western. We drove over a new bridge, built only five years ago. The building cranes are still busy here on the skyscrapers.

Overnight on the train we entered a new state, the last on this trip.

We are staying in a modern hotel near the station. We made an early start and took the road to Ajanta. This area of India is fairly dry, but there is enough rain for crops such as wheat and sorghum. When we arrived the shop sellers descended on us in force, but we managed to escape onto the shuttle bus to the caves. The caves were discovered in the late C19 by an Englishman called John Smith. These are buddhist caves. It was a little strange to make the shift after hearing the Hindu stories. I recognised some features from Dunhuang particularly the 1,000 Buddhas repeated images. There were also significant differences. The drawings of the kings and and one of the paintings of the Buddha looked distinctively Indian. There were two styles of temple, the first is the monastery style with simple rooms for monks off a square shaped cave. The second style has a stupa or chattiyas, these have curved arch roofs.

There is carving in the temples, particularly cave 26, but the caves are known for the painting. The earliest painting dates back to C2 BC. This was quite small and difficult to see, but the later painting from C5 to C7 AD was impressive. The colours are not as bright as in the Dunhuang caves in China, but the interest was in the detail of the portraits and the palace scenes. The cobra king and a white horse cropped up frequently. The portraits show detail of jewellry and costume local to the area, but also of traders from further afield. The last cave has a good sleeping Vishnu.

There was enough time on the return to Aurangabad to visit two small sites there. The first was a water tank used for the underground water system. It had a beautiful old Banyan tree next to it. The second was the mini Taj Mahal. You might think at first glance that the photos shows the Taj Mahal. We are not there, but at its later cousin. This one was built for a Shah's mother.

Asia » India » Maharashtra » Mumbai » Juhu
January 11th 2016
Published: January 28th 2016


Mumbai can be really idyllic
Global Pagoda seen from the Esselworld ferry
We made it! We finally arrived in our last destination on this trip through India. To be honest, the 2 days following the night in hospital, all, Nina wanted to do is: leave India the fastest possible and fly back home. This has happened the first time ever. Normally, time is only flying by when we are travelling and we are always very sad when it is time to return. Nina had finally decided to continue the trip for 2 reasons: one was, not to spoil Markus his holidays and one was, that a trip back would have taken about 24 hours and is very stressful for the body. Taking things easier in India was a better option once she had put the emotions to the side. So arriving in Mumbai was kind of special for us ;-) this time.

We were both happy to have survived India this time. I have no other words to end this trip. It was all about surviving. Nevertheless, we can look back on an amazing time in Vrindavan, Agra, Agonda and some perfect days in Nashik. The rest of our trip showed us a different India. Interesting, but really tough. On our last
Juhu Beach
trips around Southern India, we had met a lot of travellers who were really tired and had only one thing on their mind: to leave India. We always asked us, why? Now we got the answer. For westeners, travelling in India can be incredably hard sometimes. Even though, one does the homework well. Things are simply unpredictable. This is India.

Anyway, finishing our trip in Mumbai we felt like spoiling ourselves a little bit. Browsing the web, we finally found a supergreat deal at the Sai Palace Hotel in Andheri. It is far out of Central Mumbai, but we did not care about that. It looked nice, was close to the airport - and you are in Mumbai, it was a bargain. We booked it. And when we arrived - yes, that was the jackpot. A perfectly nice, clean and friendly hotel. OK, our room was looking over a busy street and was quite noisy. But this is kind of normal in Mumbai and earplugs do the trick. The room was big, clean, cosy with all the amenities. There are 3 different restaurants, a rooftop, free WIFI. We can highly recommend it - but look out for special deals and browse
Gate of India
we have been here the year before, but it is simply nice to walk around this area
the web!

After arriving we just felt like staying in the room for a while. We were tired of the hustle and bustle - not the best state to be in when you arrive in Mumbai. Finally we took a rickshaw and went to the Juhu Beach (which is close to the hotel). It was nice to walk along the beach in the late afternoon sun and we enjoyed being at the arabian sea again. After enjoying our time on the beach we wen to the ISKCON Temple in Juhu. We attended the afternoon aarti, stayed for some meditation and bhajans, had some prasad and enjoyed the energy. Finally we also had dinner there as the food stalls in the temple complex offer amazing food here for very small money. Needless to say we had a wonderful night in our supercomfortable room.

The next day was sunday. We had separate flights back and Markus' flight was already on sunday night. So we took it easy again. We slept till late, had an amazing breakfast (which was included) for about 2 hours. Our stomachs were ok again, so we could take full advantage of the wonderful food. Later we
view from the Global Pagoda over Gorai Island
took a rickshaw to Andheri train station (it was just a short ride away). From here we took a local train to the Churchgate Station in downtown Mumbai. We were happy that is was sunday - the train was only half full and the 30 minute ride very relaxing. From the train station we walked to the Oval Maden. We love the atmosphere there - it was packed with cricket players. Nice place for people watching. Afterwards we walked around Khala Godha. But most of the shops and galleries were closed. Never mind, because we were looking for a cafe where we went last time. They had great vegan and organic food. Unfortunately we had no idea of the name. But we finally found it. Just in time for an afternoon tea break. We had vegan waffles and a watermelon lime juice. Ahhhhh, life was good. Last time we had a great time in Mumbai. This time it was just a short visit, but still we had a fantastic time.

We continued our walk towards Colaba, the Taj Palace Hotel and the Gate of India. This area was packed with people. And a crew was filming a Bollywood Movie.
ending our trip in luxury at the price of a budget room :-)
our room in the Sai Palace Hotel
Again this was so funny to watch. We just stood there, watched the filming and had the best comedy ever. I think, everything went wrong. Either a random car passed the closed street. The policemen of the movie ran to the wrong direction (just like in real life ;-)) or the horse did not want to move. Hilarious and so very indian!

For sunset we did not miss the Chowpatty Beach. We walked along the walkway and later took the train back to Andheri. We had dinner together in the hotel and then Markus had to leave. For Nina, it was another night in India - but in a wonderful hotel. So it was ok. The next morning, she got up early, had again a yummy breakfast and then took a train north to Borivali. Her aim was to get to the Global Pagoda. From the train station in Borivali, it was difficult to get a rickshaw to the ferry landing that uses a meter. But after asking 10 drivers, it was a quick and cheap ride. To reach the Global Pagoda, it is a short ferry ride to Esselworld (the amusement parc). By being on the water, suddenly,
lobby of the Sai Palace Hotel
Mumbai is very peaceful. Once leaving Borivali behind, there is only waterchannels and mangroves all around. A pleasant surprise. And the Pagoda is really impressive. After landing it is a short walk uphill. It was really wirth visiting the Pagoda. After 2 hours enjoying the peace it was time to take the ferry and train back to Andheri. From the train station in Andheri Nina went directly again to the ISKCON Temple for a final aarti in India and some nice food. But then it was time to hurry up to get the flight to Delhi in the evening. In Delhi, Nina stayed one more night in a hotel in aerocity. Because early the next morning, she had the flight back home via Helsinki.

We were so happy to be back home safely. We realised how lucky we are that we live in such a nice, clean and peaceful place. Do not get us wrong, India is still a fascinating country for us and we will surely come back. But we need a break for a while. We need to ""digest"" some things we have experienced and seen. And we will never go on a trip to India when
road in front of the Sai Palace Hotel in Andheri
yes, busy busy busy........ day and night
we are stressed from work. When we go to India next time, we will start relaxed and put some beach time in the end.

Namaste!

January 7th 2016

Markus with a saddhu on Brahmaghiri Hill
at the source of the holy Godavari River
After 4 nights in Aurangabad Nina had recovered. She still felt a bit weak, but we decided to move on. Our next destination was Shirdi. We wanted to visit the world famous Sai Baba Temple.

From the shabby and chaotic bus terminal in Aurangabad we tried to get a local bus to Shirdi. First we had to wait for 1 hour to final find a bus. Nothing is written in english and people only speak Marathi, the local language. It was quite a challenge to get on the right bus - especially as when the bus arrived, people were really fighting like animals to get on the bus. With our 2 backpacks we also started pushing and we finally got on the bus. Nina was just relaxed when she finally could share 2 seats with some children - half of a seat was better than standing. After one hour we found more space and could finally sit both more or less comfortably. In the meantime, poor Markus was feeling terrible. He had a cold and fever was rising. Luck was still not on our side. There was another break after 2 hours into our trip. At the bus station a
enjoying our time in Nashik
@ Ramkund
passenger felt sick and did not make it out off the bus. So he was vommiting on the stairs of the bus - just in front of us. But this time we were lucky. It was awful, but we were save and also our backpacks were save. The smell was all that ""stuck"" to us. The driver quickly ""cleaned"" it with a little bit of water. Needless to say that we were really happy, when the bus started moving again and we got some fresh air. In total, after 4 hours we reached Shirdi. The only thing we had on our mind was getting to our hotel.

The Sujal Palace, our Hotel, was ok. The room was clean, it was affordable. But the service was mediocre and the staff was not friendly at all. We had a soup and relaxed a little bit. When we felt fit enough we went for a quick walk around Shirdi. This town is only build up for tourists, or better: pilgrims. There is one hotel complex next to another, there are travel shops everywhere. In the middle of the small town there is the famous Shri Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir and some other
cheeky monkeys on the way up to Brahmaghiri Hill
temples. We jsut looked around and went back to the hotel as Markus was really feeling terrible with fever and a cold. So we had another early night. The next day, Markus was feeling better. As in the hotel, they did not offer breakfast (although there was a restaurant), we had a nice breakfast at a hotel next door. After we dressed nicely for the temple and visited some temple. For the evening aarti we finally made our way inside the samadhi mandir. It was very nice and we could feel a very strong and peaceful atmosphere the closer we came to the Sai Baba Murthi in the front. But again, the many indian pilgrims and tourists were taking out everything from us. They were constantly pushing us. On elady hit Nina and wanted to push her to the side with the argument ""I want to go to the aarti"". Sorry lady, when you are in the queue for the aarti there person in front of you ""may"" want the same....... Actually the atmosphere was quite aggressive something we had never experienced in a temple before. It is always busy and people are always pushing each other. But this was
Nashik
really intense here. After the aarti we tried to figure out how we could go to the morning aarti and the darshan without queuing with all those people as we saw that there are special tickets. But to get these tickets one again has to wait for 1 hour. We got different information, but they did not sell the tickets. We would need to come back at 4 am for the tickets. But at that time an aarti takes place and those in the aarti cannot get a ticket. Other pilgrims told us to wait from midnight on to get a ticket otherwise there is no chance to get one.

In the end this was only getting on our nerves. We finally decided to go back to the samadhi mandir on our own without an official darshan or an official aarti. At any time of the day you can enter in the very back. From here you also see Sai Baba, you can have your private darshan - and this is what we did. Quietly without anyone pushing us. We came here to feel the energy of Sai Baba. And we did not come to have an event with
a bus ticket
from where to where and how much is it? ;-)
lots of tourists. So, in the end, we were happy and thankful with what we received. We had a nice dinner and the next morning, made our way to Nashik.

This time, after all we had gone through during the last days, we had hired a private driver for a drop in Nashik. By the time we wanted to leave, the driver was not there. We had to go to his office and remind him. But then, everything went smoot and 2 comfortable hours later we arrived in Nashik. We had booked in a decent hotel near the Kalika Mandir. First we walked around the newer part of Nashik and were surprised to find an ultranew huge shopping mall. The city was much bigger than we expected but we liked it instantly. We visited the Kalika Mandir, which is a really beautiful Kali Temple and had a nice dinner at our hotel, the Rama Heritage Hotel . The food was nice and we were happy again both feeling much better in the meantime. The following day was packed with exploring Nashik. We went to the Ramkund where part of the Kumbh Mela 2015 took place. We did not take a bath but
people speak only little english here....... this sign says it all :-)
at least washed our hands and feet in the holy Godavari River. We visted a lot of smaller temples. One highlight was a small Sai Baba Temple. Someone invited us to stay a bit longer as 5 minutes later a puja was starting including an aarti. We stayed and enjoyed it very much. It was another wonderful blessing from Sai Baba. Later we walked around the Panchavati area, the old part of Nashik. We visited the Kala Rama Temple and finally went to the Sita Gumph. These are the caves where Sita hid while being assailed by the evil Ravana. It was great to climb down the narrow steps into the caves. Furtheron we went over the Victoria Bridge to the Sundar Narayan Temple and than to the MG Road area with lot of shops and stall everywhere. This was a busy area but we loved it. Here one can buy everything! And prices are fair - it is no tourist rip off. Finally, after some suffering, we were back in a place we really loved. The fun of travelling in India was slowly coming back. The perfect days was finished with an invitation to join a puja at a
view from our room in Shirdi
little roadside temple in front of the hotel. It was a privately owned temple. there was a puja, we were singing some bhajans and got a lot of prasad in the end. And of course, the owners kept taking pictures of us and asking us questions. It was great fun and really nice.

Next day we got up early and took a bus to Trimbakeshwar. This village is about 33 km west of Nashik. It is home to one of India's most sacred temples, the Trimbakeshwar Temple containing a yjoti lingam and one of the 12 most important shrines to Shiva. The Lonely Planet says tha tonly Hindus are allowed inside. As the queues again were huge we decided to try and buy a special ticket. We were just about to buy our ticket when an indian appeared behind us and told us, he wanted to invite us into the temple. He gave us the ticket, showed us the way into the temple and then went to his family and followed us into the temple. How kind is that? We were left speechless! This is India - sometimes people are so very welcoming and friendlywithout any expectations. WOW! So
ready for a visit of the Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir
finally, we were inside the temple. We got a darshan and were even allowed to sit in a quiet place to meditate as long as we wanted. Right in the middle of one of the most sacred temples in India. Well, we enjoyed it and really meditated for a while. It was amazing and we were so blessed.

Then it was time to walk up the Brahmaghiri Hill to the source of the Godavari River (which is a holy river in India). We took a riskshaw to the starting point close to the village. There we rented a stick (to protect us against the monkeys) and started walking. After a few meters we met 2 saddhus. They started talking to us - not knwoing english. But with hands and feet and our hearts we could communicate somehow. We told them about our spiritual master, Sri Swami Vishwananda. One of the saddhus knew the name. We told them the mantra and like this we ended up singing our mantra while climbing up the Brahmaghiri Hill. How amazing was that! No other indians were asking us for pictures or molesting us with other questions because they were really irriteted what the
Shirdi
2 white persons were doing with the saddhus and while we were singing and laughing together. Hilarious. When we arrived at the source of the Godavari River, one of the saddhus made an abishekam and gave us some drops of the water! What a gift! We got water from the source of a holy river! The other saddhu then took us to a Krishna Temple and made a puja and even gave us prasad. We were so blessed. We thanked them thousand times, gave them some water. We had nothing to eat with us which we could share and they did not want any money. So all we could was to say thank you.

We climbed down and took the bus back to Nashik. It was another amazing day in our trip, if not the most amazing day on this trip. Days like this remind us why we travel through India. We had an amazing time in Nashik, a plce, we are sure to come back one day.

The following day however it was time to leave....

Asia » India » Maharashtra » Aurangabad
January 4th 2016
Published: January 21st 2016


beautiful gardens at sunrise around the Bibi-qa-Maqbara
Aurangabad
It was a difficult route we had chosen. Going with public transport from Bijapur to Aurangabad is not common (needless to say that a Lonely Planet not even thinks about such an option). But we finally found a solution. Especially bad is such a long overnight trip, when exactly that day we both started with a light ""colon clense"". So all we hoped was that it did not turn worse. By train we left Bijapur around sunset. It was a 3 hour drive to Solapur. Solarpur seems to be a rich industrial city in Maharashtra. Suddenly houses looked much nicer and shops looked more expensive. We took a rickshaw to the private bus stand and first went to a nearby restaurant. We had 2 more hours to kill before our night bus left. Markus had a nice dinner (his stomach had settled in the meantime), Nina preferred just some lime juice. Better stay safe for a night on the bus. Then it was time to board our first sleeper bus. It left Sholapur at 10.30pm. After 3 shaking hours there was a short toilet stop (which we thankfully did not need!) in the middle of nowhere and in the morning at
Bibi-qa-Maqbara or Poor Man's Taj
5am we arrived in Aurangabad. We immediately went to our hotel, the Krishna Inn. They were very polite and welcoming but unfortunately were fully booked so they did not have a free room at that time of the day (for later yes, we had prebooked one). But we could use a bathroom and leave our luggage at the reception. We hang around the lobby till daylight came out and then we went to see the ""poor man's Taj"" or better the Bibi-qa-Maqbara. It is a mausoleum, as well, and resembles its bigger brother. We were the first ones who entered the grounds. No school classes, no other people. Just the beautiful building, the gardens, surrounding hills and us. It was perfect and we really loved it. It is not so very well maintained as the Taj Mahal but still some effort is put into the gardens and the building. We walked around the grounds for 1 hour and enjoyed it very much.

Although we were really tired of the night with only a few hours of light sleep in a shaky bus (these speed bumps in India are simply horrible), but we started to enjoy travelling in India again.
Nina in hospital
We were welcomed warmly in a promising hotel, we went to an amazing sight - so we felt like celebrating the day and went to the nice Lemon Tree Hotel where we had the most amazing buffet breakfast. Nina's stomach was still a bit upset but much better and Markus was feeling well. So we had a whale of a time trying all the goodies for breakfast.

Later we checked in in our amazing room at Krishna Inn. Live in India was good for us again. Furthermore, we really liked Aurangabad. We went into town and to the Central Market - and we did quite some shopping. No tourist hassle, fixed and fair prices and really great shops. We ended this perfect day with a nice dinner in the Vrindavan Restaurant which is in the Krishna Inn and has excellent vegetarian treats.

After a wonderful night in a clean bed and a quiet room we had breakfast in our room (strange for us but popular in India - and it was included and really tasty). And then it was time for another highlight. We took a local bus (that was the oldest and shabbiest bus we had ever
enjoying the view
Ellora caves
taken so far) to Ellora. It took around 45 minutes till we arrived in Ellora which is situated in the hills surrounding Aurangabad. The landscape there is really beautiful. OK - 37 cave temples were waiting to be explored. But first we had a nice chai tea before we startet with the oldest temples, which are the Buddhist temples. They were really impressive. It is unbelievable what these artists did at that time without many tools! They only used hammers and chisels.

Also the Hindu temples left us speeless sometimes. Especially the famous Kailash Temple is a masterpiece of architecture. It is an engineering marvel. This rock-cut temple was executed straight from the head with zero margin for error. Wooooow! We went as far as the latests Jain Temples which were also beautiful but did not have the details of the other temples. We must admit we were really tired that evening and both fell asleep on the bus back to Aurangabad.

We had a nice dinner and suddenly, Nina started again with a diarrhea. It had been better for 2 days but it came back. Markus, as well, started after a while but it was not so
dinner in Solapur
bad. With Nina it went so bad that she got dehydrated and she finally decided to go to a hospital at 11 pm. Thankfully, a private hospital was just a 10 minutes walk away. The doctor was competent but she made it very clear that Nina had to stay for the night. It was a bacterial food infection and Nina would have antibiotics to take via infusion. Markus would have to stay with her beacause they do not have any personal helping the patients. So we settled in for a horrible night in an indian hospital. We got a private room with our own bathroom. But in the bathroom there were coakroaches, the sheets were filthy and we both were just scared to pick up any other diseases. But ok, Nina got infusions with new and sterile needles and everything went smooth. The next morning, although not sleeping much, Nina felt better and finally, at 10 am we were allowed to leave hospital. We were really happy. In the meantime, every patient of the hospital who could still walk, had visited us. They did not enter the room. They were standing behind the door and starring at us through a
Markus enjoying a Paper Dosa in Solapur
window in the door. We felt like animals in a zoo - no privacy, just a constant starring of some random people. When the doctor finally came and told us to leave, Nina was crying because she was so relieved. Exactly at that moment, the door of our room was opened and the manager of the hotel came in. He just wanted to see, how we were and if we need something. This was so very nice. He even offered us to stay longer. The hotel was fully booked but he promised us to keep our room - he would find a solution. This is India - one moment you are angry about the people and how they behave and the next moment you turn around and someone is exactly finding the right words in the right moment. Amazing!

But another struggle was to finally get the medicine. After a while and with the help of the hotel manager we figured out which stores are farmacies. But one farmacy does not have all the medicine. As Nina was feeling week, poor Markus had to run from one farmacy to the next till he got all the drugs. But after
on the sleeper bus from Solapur to Aurangabad
a nice hot shower, some more sleep and some hydrating fresh lime juice with sugar and salt and coconut water, Nina was feeling much better. Anyway, we stayed in the hotel lobby and reorganised our trip. Markus was also still having some troubles but it looked like for him the ayurvedic medicine was perfect. We had decided to stay 2 more nights in Aurangabad to have enough time to recover. We were tired. Our enthusiasm had just come back and now this - we needed a break. And the Krishna Inn in Aurangabad was such a lovely hotel - we felt at home here. So we cancelled more destinations (we had planned to go to Matheran in the hills for 2 nights for hiking and we skipped Ajanta). The following day we still took it very easy. We went to the market in Aurangabad one more time and visited a lovely Shiva Temple. The resting was good for us. After 4 ""eventful"" days and nights in Aurangabad it was finally time to leave. Again we thank the Krishna Inn for the great support!

Another local bus brought us to our next destination....

Ready to put some real miles on the road
After doing few short road trips around Pune, it was time to do one long road trip. Night riding on my Avenger was what I always wanted to do. Coincidentally one family event was coming up at my wife's native place Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh which is close to 900km from Pune. I thought this was a golden opportunity. So, I decided, let's plan for this road trip. There was no way my parents would have given me permission for this. I secretly started planning for this trip. I booked train tickets for my parents in such a way that they would leave at least 2 hrs before me. I had to lie about my availability for the family event due to workload at my office. Everything happened as per plan. As soon as my parents left, I packed my bag, took all the necessary things like tyre tubes, headlight fuse, torch, swiss knife, etc, which I had already purchased, strapped my luggage to the motorcycle and yes I was ready for my first solo motorcycle ride of 900km, ready to put some real miles on the bike.

Started at 6 pm with the tour plan to follow the route as;
2 Somewhere near Amravati
Selfie with RURAL INDIA


Wakad(Pune)-Shikrapur-Ranjangaon-Ahmednagar-Aurangabad-Sindhkhed raja-Mehkar-Amravati-Nagpur-Balaghat.

Within no time I crossed Shikrapur then crossed Ranjangaon then crossed Ahmednagar and then Aurangabad, I was cruising with all the adrenaline rushing through me. It was like I own this Highway. Night is beautiful, unless you are not scared of darkness.

I found that there was a sense of respect for each other on the highways. Every time the vehicle, be it a truck or a car or a motorcycle, coming from opposite direction, it would turn its light from high beam to dipper.

It was 12 o'clock midnight and I was hungry. I am very fond of Dhabas by the highway. Took halt at a small dhaba which had a proper setting of ""Khatiya"" where I sat and ordered dal tadka and tandoori roti, what a delight. Took a good 1 hr break, had my Sutta listening to ""typical"" dhaba songs. I would give up anything for this moment. Wished my wife shared this moment with me. I missed her. But I am sure after hearing to my experiences, she would definitely not want to miss the next tour with me. It was time to hit the road again. Checked my luggage
3 My Bike taking a nap
and here I go. I arrived to Sindhked Raja. Sindhked Raja has a specific significance in Maratha history. It is birthplace of Jijabai ""Mata"" mother of greatest warrior Shivaji Maharaj.

Road condition here is very bad. It seemed as if I were on Mars. I hardly covered 5 km in 15 minutes. And since it was dark, it was pretty scary to stop and take one photo. The road condition should be better for a place of such significance.

It was around 4 am when I arrived at Mehkar and till now there was hardly anyone on the road. Sometimes it gave me a creepy feeling that someone is watching me. I guess it may happen to anyone as we are exposed to so many paranormal stories. As the time progressed, the life in the rural areas of Maharashtra started picking up. People trying to finish off morning business at the roadside as long as it was still dark. Hope I didn't disturbed them. Some of them getting ready for milk, newspaper deliveries. As the sun rose I started seeing more people. After the whole night drive I was tired and I felt like talking to someone. I stopped my motorcycle at the roadside. A farmer came and he was concerned whether everything was ok or not as he thought my motorcycle got broke down. It was very kind of him. We both started talking about family, work and all stuff. He was so kind that he asked me to stay for lunch. I politely declined to his offer as I had to reach Balaghat till afternoon. I took a selfie together, a memory which I would cherish lifetime.

I said ""bhetu parat"" in Marathi which means ""bye"" in English and I left. His name is Alok Halke. I was thinking about him and realised that he seemed so content with his life. Talking to him was like a morning boost. All my tiredness was gone and I was refreshed. I learned new perspective of life, ""Being content with what you have"". Its amazing that travelling teaches you so much. You become wiser after each trip you do.

Further I crossed Amravati and then Wardha and touched AH46 Nagpur highway, a four lane express way amazing road. Touched speed of 110 kmph and never slowed down this speed till Bhandara.

Around 3 pm I crossed Madhya Pradesh border and reached Balaghat at 4 pm.

Everybody here was shocked and surprised. No one would believe that I drove from Pune to Balaghat. My parents scolded me especially my mom who was really worried. If I were unmarried my mother would have beaten me for being careless. On one hand mom scolded me and on the other hand she also wanted to tell people about my ""glory"". Since it was a function many guest who attended the function came to know about my road trip. Some thought I was a fool while some of them thought it was a daring thing to ride in the night. Some of the guests were old-timers who shared their biking experiences.

My first road trip, took me 22 hrs of riding, started at 6pm and ended at 4pm, achieved a personal milestone.

A ride, a journey which made me realize how much I love being on the road, travelling, talking to people, knowing about their perspective and an experience that would certainly be helpful for my future tours.

Being thoroughly spoilt at my treat hotel, Abode Boutique Hotel, Bombay
Mumbai is massive, majestic and marvellous!!

Although I was advised to skip Mumbai as I was told it is expensive and just another big city, I am glad that I decided to take some time out to explore this historic and interesting city.

Yes it is expensive and it is a big city but as I said in my previous blog every place I visit in India is a completely different India. Mumbai is very much influenced by the British Raj and has many huge Victorian buildings, libraries and museums. To me it feels a little like London but with very Indian twists. Poverty is very much in your face here with slums stretching for miles across the city and homeless and disabled people scattered across the streets. The city is busy and quite nosy but has sophisticated vibes due to the extremely wealthy that live or spend time in this city.

Mumbai is famous for two main things; the very expensive and posh Taj Hotel, which faces India Gate – the gateway of India. I was lucky enough to stay about 30 seconds walk from both of these historic pieces of architecture in a very beautiful hotel
040
The Prince Of Wales Museum, Colaba
called Abode Boutique Hotel. This was my treat hotel of my whole trip and after two nights stay I feel very pampered and spoilt. The hotel has a vintage feel and encourages eco-friendly and ethical awareness. At Mumbai airport I was picked up by one of the hotel’s drivers; a female driver who is a single parent coming from a lower class background. The hotel had trained her to be a driver giving her the chance for a decent paid job. It was very reassuring for me arriving in a new city alone to be picked up by a female driver. I also treated myself on the Monday to a massage at the hotel spa. Abode Hotel have links with a local Blind Hospital where they train blind and partially sighted women to be masseuses, so I experienced a wonderful full body Ayruvedic massage by a blind woman. It was such a beautiful massage and amazing to think that she couldn’t see me and was totally relying on the sense of touch to massage my body, make me feel so much better and fully relaxed.

The part of Mumbai in which I was staying is known as Colaba in
050
Looking back at the Taj Hotel and India Gate from the ferry to Elephanta Island
South Mumbai. I didn’t actually venture out of this district; partly due to the fact that I had limited time and was alone but mainly because there was so much to see within this one district. I visited the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, formerly known as The Prince of Wales Museum, which was very close to my hotel. This is a really huge but very interesting museum full of ancient art work, sculptures and artefacts of India including many prints of old Bombay. I particularly liked the sculpture exhibition on the ground floor and by using the free audio guide I was able to learn so much more about the Hindu religion and their different Gods. It was a really interesting museum with almost too much to see but because it was very hot inside I could only manage to explore two of the three floors.

On my third and final day in Mumbai I had a guided tour, arranged by the hotel, on Elephanta Island. Elephanta Island is situated around 11km off the coast of Mumbai and took about one hour to travel there by ferry. It was fun being on a little ferry boat again and
093
Inside one of the caves on Elephanta Island, you can see Shiva's Lingam inside the temple in the background
really made me feel like I was back at home in Poole Harbour for a moment. The island itself is very mountainous but at the harbour point it has a real beachy feel to it. The just over 1000 people that live on this Island rely on tourism and fishing for their income. When we arrived on the Island we had to walk up 120 stairs to get to the famous Elephanta Caves. The weather on the Island was extremely hot and humid but inside the caves it was nice and cool. The main cave was fascinating; it was basically a massive ancient temple dedicated to the Hindu God Shiva. When the Portugese came to India in the 16th Century they invaded Elephanta Island and used the caves for shooting practise. What took years for the Indian’s to carefully design intricate statues for their cave temples took seconds for the Portugese to destroy with their guns. However luckily they didn’t manage to destroy all of the statues – you can still make out a lot of the original beautiful artwork, and the main columns supporting the entire caves have been re-made to hold the foundations for these amazing caves. It was a very interesting tour and my guide was full of information about the stories behind the different statues of Shiva. He was born and lived on the Island and so knew everything about it, he even invited me to his family home after the tour to share some Diwali sweets which was very lovely.

So my brief but wonderful stay in Mumbai has now ended and I’m currently sitting in my hotel lobby waiting to get an overnight train to Goa tonight. I’m very glad that I did come to Mumbai even for the short amount of time that I did. I learnt a lot and managed to see some interesting sites. I also ate far too much in some fancy restaurants and felt thoroughly spoilt in the hotel. The highlight for me was arriving back on Monday night from my dinner and finding my bed to be made with a note saying ‘Sweet Dreams’ and some flowers and chocolates left on the bed – a very surprising and thoughtful gift from the housekeeping of the hotel.

If I ever come back to Mumbai again I will be sure to stay in Abode Hotel and I will recommend it to everyone. Now after feeling very pampered I am looking forward to spending five days on a beach in Goa.

Journey to the Other Side of the World
Chicago-->Düsseldorf-->Frankfurt-->Mumbai-->Pune-->Dapoli-->Velneshwar-->Talvade-->Pune-->Jaipur-->Agra-->Delhi-->Mumbai-->Delhi-->Frankfurt-->Chicago[clear]From Chicago to Düsseldorf to Frankfurt to Mumbai, I've added another continent to my passport. A railway passage on the Deccan Queen took me from Mumbai to Pune, and then from there, meeting all the fantastic people that would share the next unknowns with me. Onward travels to Dapoli, Velneshwar, & Talavade (Amba) for sacred groves and deities, and back up to Pune to say our goodbyes. My solo adventure carried me onto Jaipur for elephants, and a last-minute excursion to Agra to see the famed Taj. One final railway trip to Delhi led me to a nail-biting tuk-tuk ride speeding toward DEL, but I had plenty of time to make my flight. Too much time, actually, as it was delayed almost two hours—my exact window of time to catch my flights home from Mumbai. Once in Mumbai, I was bounced back to Delhi to catch the next flight to Frankfurt . . . but of course I'd never make my connection. One exhausted night later, I was finally en route back to Chicago.


Look at all these wonderful faces
Wow, it's been two months to the day since I've returned home from travels, and it almost feels like it was eons ago. I wish I had my field notebook next to me as I write this, but that's safely tucked away at home, alongside other souvenirs, field guides, travel guides, and undoubtedly at least one unpacked parcel.

I'm almost finding it difficult to reflect on my time, especially after stumbling upon my old blogs from when I was in France (and hence the desire to link this entry to past travels). Re-reading those old thoughts gave me a glimpse back into a different person then, one who was clearly astounded by all the world had to offer, one who wasn't afraid to say any and all of whatever thoughts pop in my lil' ol' head. Really wishing I had my field notebook . . .

I came out of India with a few definite decisions: 1) I no longer regret joining AIP instead of GFP, 2) it is essential to continue keeping an open mind, & 3) India deserves a 2nd chance. Now, to extrapolate:

1) GFP AIP is where it's at. When I began this program,
Cliff diving.
I found out about GFP only after AIP . . . wait, what do you mean you get to travel around the world not once, but three times, all while earning the same degree I am?!? Yes, it probably costs more, but who cares! Fast-forward to the last day in Pune—these students that I have just shared the dampest of times with are some of the most amazing people I've ever met. But they're flung across the States (and in Mohammed's case, the other side of the world). I'm probably never going to see any of them again (hopefully, graduation?), and I've only had a few, painfully short, number of days to get to know them, to see what really drives them, and the secret of their awesomeness. My AIP peeps, on the other hand, I've been seeing their mugs for the last two-and-a-half years, and I appreciate them all the more for it. If I had joined GFP, I would probably not have gotten the chance to build such lasting connections with as many wonderful people.

2) I knew going to India would be a culture shock, and I truly believe spending a week in rural Guatemala a
Certainly not what I would have expected.
few years back helped ease that transition (still ranks as one of my least-favorite trips ), but there was still a lot for me to learn. Yes, I had studied a bit of Hinduism, and yes, I had asked every single question possible of my vet to gain some insider knowledge, and yes, I pored over and dog-eared Enjoying India: The Essential Guide, but I knew there was still quite a bit I didn't know, couldn't know, and wouldn't understand. Case in point: a sign posted at one of the last stops we made on the journey back to Pune—""Save Earth - Save Water - Use Disposable""—say what?! Add more trash and refuse to an already over-populated landscape? It boggles the Western mind. But then one has to strip away all the preconceived notions (what was it that we were taught in regard to community-based conservation, to not fix the problem that we believe exists, but rather, ask the community if and how they want help?) and realize how precious a resource water is. It was such a jolting sign and made me realize not all conservation actions and beliefs may be shared, nor prioritized, by all.

3)
10 year visa? Yeah, I can do this again. I still don't expect to see a tiger, but I'd like some sort of wildlife. And festivals. More festivals. Especially in the south. But this time, not during the monsoon (truly, not because of the water—but because a good deal of national parks are closed during the rains)!

Sleeping on the floor in Mumbai airport
It is now 4.00am Indian time. We now have a five hour wait until the next flight. I have literally never been so exhausted. Me and Emma have decided to take it in turns on sleeping. Only an hour until it is my turn.

This airport is surreal. The people at the transfer desk were so slow and rude and clearly didn't care if they were doing their jobs properly. Finally got it sorted, desperate for the toilet only too find the most disgusting ones I have ever seen in my entire life. One row were squat toilets and the only were normal, but there was wee everywhere. And I mean everywhere. It baffles me how anyone could even have managed to make that much of a mess. The cleaner was lying on the floor, fast asleep. But maybe I am just exaggerating and cranky because I haven't slept in about 24 hours.

Again, we are so thirsty but we don't have any money in Indian currency to buy drinks. I NEED to sleep on this next plane because my tiredness is taking away the excitement. Right now, all I want is a bed and a shower and to
View from the plane
brush my disgusting teeth. I am so glad the return flights are shorter. At least on the way there I have the excitement to keep my spirits up. On the way back I may break down.

As cranky as I feel know, I know it will all be worth it. I just need to think of the tuck-tuks, the jungle, the parties and the elephants!

Wanting to go to these places since 2009 (mentioned in my 2009 blog as well 😉 ) .. and finally could get it planned!!

Our only conditions before we left.. self drive and fill in as much adventure as we can !!

Mahabaleshwar- the place which produces 80%!o(MISSING)f the country's strawberries looked more like a strawberry town as we entered. Filled with mapro products all over and beautiful hills. Wasn't too green as it was of course summer but it had its own beauty.. Checked in to the Bella Vista resort and started our sight seeing right away. With kids of hyper energy levels, there is never a rest day 😉 All thanks to Google and their maps, we started our drive with Venna lake- a place kids would love for their horse riding and boating. And wanted to end the day with something easy and hence went to the Mapro garden. The highlights of this place - a video showing how they produce strawberry and its products, a store for all their products and the best part - awesome fresh fruit juice with cream and pizzzaas (and you can see them make it from scratch). The day
20150524_095032
ended with a peaceful dinner at the resort as they had a kids play room near the restaurant 😊

The next day was allocated just for the hills- started with Kates point, Mahabaleshwar temple, Auther's seat, Elphinstone point, Pratapgad Fort and finally Mumbai sunset point. The view points were beautiful view of the valleys from different angels and the fort is a must see in spite of its 300+ steps. For the mommies with little kids, you can get help to carry your kid all through at the bottom of the fort 😊 It happens only in India !! Mahabaleshwar derives its name from ""Mahabal""- Mahabal and Atibal created huge disruptions in the world and Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh were prayed to release the world from their wrath. Vishnu killed Atibal, however Mahabal had the boon of 'death at will'. Hence, the gods requested Adimaya to charm Mahabal. Mahabal said to Adimaya that I will die in your hands only if the 3 Gods agree to reside on earth in our names. Hence, Vishnu in the form of Atibaleshwar, Shiva in the form of Mahabaleshwar and Brahma in the form of Koteshwar (The demon army) resided here.

And now
DSC_0208
comes the best part of the M'war trip, as we were done with all the regular view point stuff, thought of doing something different and hence did some small search on google and went to the Tapola lake. We knew that it would be a good drive with good roads and greenery but didn't expect to land up in a rare taken road with the whole tapola lake just for ourselves. We could not see a soul and had the hills and lake just for ourselves. Amazing beauty!

The next day we left early for Khandala - Lonavla. Wonderful Zara resort, but were pretty disappointed as we were not aware that every place requires a trek to reach the place!! We managed the Bhaja caves 300+ steps with Jaggu carrying Vahin all through, but didn't have the strength for the Lohagod Fort, Karva caves and Pavana dam trek. We did see them all from a distance though and did try to drive until Pavana- but the road was atrocious and returned when we were 3 km away from the lake. This place is surely a treat for trekkers, and a good challenging drive for driving and nature lovers 😊
20150530_102842
Thanks to Lions point, the kids got their share of horse rides, camel rides and maggi as we saw the sunset.

And now we were truly looking forward to our Lavasa stay. We have heard so much about the place and seen it on our Telugu Mahesh Babu songs 😊 that the kids were super excited.. As we were driving towards The Waterfront Shaw, we were so upset to see no water in the river.. just parked and entered the Promenade and were zapped. WOW! Truly amazing. What a sight to see.. hills, lovely water and the awesomely maintained streets. It was total fun and adventure the next 2 days with water sports, adventure sports- zip line, burma bridge, archery, shooting, cycling, driving around and our late night walks. Lovely street food and everything we could ask for to end our vacation with a bang!! The studio apartment on the water front let us put the kids to bed and walk down for a late night stroll as well!! Loved the place!

And with loads of memories and tons of pictures, we dropped the car back at the airport (the carzonrent experience was great too!) and got back
20150525_152738
home with energy to surely last us for a few more months.. or at least until our next trip 😊

Singapore Airport
This trip to India, was not like any other trip I have ever done for two reasons. One, I was not with Chris, and two, it was for work.

To get to Pune, I flew Cairns to Brisbane, Brisbane to Singapore, Singapore to Mumbai, then a 3 hour drive from Mumbai to Pune. Most of the flights was with Singapore Airlines which was pretty comfy and I love airplane food! I love the little compartments and little drink cups. I also really like Singapore Airport. It's the prettiest and most fun airport I've been in, but this time my stop over was only 1 hr. I think from door to door my trip was about 25 hours ... needless to say ... it was a long trip.

Pune is 560m above sea level so it's not as humid Mumbai, it's actually surprisingly green, even thought it was dusty and 36 degrees outside. And I've been told that it's super green after the rainy season. Pune is one of the major cities of India that is set up for foreign owned companies and has a special economic zone. However this has not made them think that they should improve their
View from hotel
infrastructure. The drive to work in the morning was probably only a couple of kms but it would take 30-45 minutes due to the bad roads and traffic congestion.

I stayed at the Marriott Courtyard then later at the Marriott JW, both which were super nice and fancy places. The staff were very nice, the food was amazing, my bed was huge and the bathroom was big enough to have a party in! The Marriott JW had a really nice open rooftop bar and a Western style nightclub in the basement.

This trip was pretty much all work and not much play. But I did have a few great outings with my workmates.

One trip was to Shaniwar Wada, which literally translated means Saturday House, as it was the king of the Maratha empire's weekend palace. It is a residential fort that was built 1732. The gates are impressive, huge, steal structures covered in spikes to keep the elephants out. It was mostly destroyed in a fire, but you can see where the rooms would have been and the water fountains and gardens etc. There is a secret door, with the King would sneak in his mistress.
Shandi Wada


There is a huge shopping mall in Pune, with levels and levels of international stores....I could have spent LOTS of time and money there! There are also cute street markets selling trinkets, jewellery, toys and clothes. Kingfisher beer is on tap everywhere and the bars we went to were all pretty cool.

March 9th 2015

Gateway of India, Mumbai
From Kochi I flew with SpiceJet to Pune, located in the state of Maharashtra. The city is located about 140km southeast of Mumbai and has around 4 million people. Honestly, there wasn’t much interesting stuff to see and do here and I didn't visit for tourism. The reason I went to Pune was to catch up with Saiprasad, and Indian guy I hosted two years ago in Curaçao through Couchsurfing. We always remained in touch and he travels a lot too, so we had a lot of stories to share. Given the fact that Pune isn’t too far from Mumbai, I decided to fly to Pune and stay for just three days before continuing to Mumbai. I spent most of my time with Sai and his family and friends, going to the mall, going to a bar, watching movies, go to the cinema and so on. Nothing special to mention. And of course I had plenty of time to do some typing and search for information about upcoming destinations.

I took a bus from Pune to Mumbai, which took about 3.5 hours. Mumbai (or Bombay) is the largest city in India by population with about 14 million people and
Mumbai at night
it's the financial capital of the country. It’s a very hectic city and I was immediately able to experience that from the moment I stepped out of the bus at Dadar bus-station. So many scooters, cars, taxis and pedestrians; so much noise and constant honking! I had to go to the toilet and I crossed the street to use a public toilet on the corner. They had some urinals there and the stench was unbearable. I had never, ever smelled such a bad urine odour before! Even though I knew what to expect of Mumbai, it was still a bit overwhelming and I did not like the city! I seriously considered skipping Mumbai but I'm happy that I got to see and experience a little of the city! I was invited by a couchsurfer, Frazan, who hosted me in the city for 3 nights. It was the first time in just over a year that I used Couchsurfing again. I took a taxi to Frazan’s apartment and after driving for about three minutes, the engine stopped running and they had to push the taxi to the side of the road. They called another taxi to proceed with my ride. Frazan
Dharavi, slum in Mumbai
was a very friendly guy and an excellent host. He was extremely helpful and explained in details how to get around Mumbai. There was also a Polish couchsurfer, Marchin, staying there and together we explored the city a little bit. Frazan himself was pretty busy with work so we didn't spend much time with him. We took a train to South Mumbai, where we wandered around for some time. Taking the train is an adventure on its own. The doors remain open and people like to stand at the door, even when the train is moving. Apparently, an average of 10 people die every day on the trains in and around Mumbai. We arrived at the station and went down on the platform just when a train was leaving. Marchin went quickly on board but he remained near the door, blocking the entrance a little. I had to tell him quickly to move while the train already started to move and I had to run a little bit and jump on board!


South Mumbai is where the big arch is located, Gateway of India, which was built in the 1920’s to commemorate the visit of British royals in
Kochi (Cochin) International Airport
1911. Many buildings in South Mumbai were built in European style. The luxurious Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is also located here, which was one of the targets during the November 2008 terrorist attacks. We had a short walk inside this world famous hotel. From a pier close to the Gateway of India, we boarded a boat that took us to Elephanta Island, just off the coast in the Arabian Sea. The ride lasted about one hour. The island is well known for its caves, which are temples with several sculptures carved out of rocks. It is not exactly known when they were done, but it’s estimated that it must have been around the 6th or 7th century. Some sculptures are pretty well preserved, many others were not. The arrival of the Portuguese in the 1500’s didn't do the caves any good.


The next day we took a slum-tour. As most people know, poverty is very much present and visible in India and many people live in slums. This company organizes walking tours through Dharavi, a slum with about a million inhabitants and it’s the largest in India. The majority of the profit they make, goes back to the
Comfortable couches at Kochi International Airport
community in the form of projects. Pictures were not allowed inside the slum but I was a little bit naughty and quickly snapped just “one” picture with my phone. To enter the slum we had to walk over a bridge which crosses above the rail road. From the bridge we were allowed to take pictures and from here you already get a good impression of what you’re about to see once you go down the stairs and enter the slum. On the right there were kids playing cricket but the field had a lot of garbage laying around. A whole disorganized block of shacks and houses made of inadequate material and roofs full of plastic and other rubbish is what your eyes will be seeing when standing on that bridge. It rained a little bit the day before, so there was a lot of mud. It’s chaotic, it’s busy, at some parts it stinks, dirty water flows along the streets at some parts, children walking bare feet and playing close to a pile of garbage just behind their house. None of these things surprised me, since I knew what to expect. I've seen slums in Venezuela, Philippines, Argentina, Ghana and
The SpiceJet plane in which I flew to Pune
Cambodia for example, but it was the first time I actually walked this much through one. All I could think about, again, was how fortunate I am. That’s the reason why we should appreciate the things we have and count our blessings, instead of complaining too much and being materialistic. Dharavi has electricity and water supply, which makes it a pretty good slum compared to those that do not have these basic services. Some of the alleys in Dharavi were so narrow that the bigger people among us would not fit through! If you go without a guide, you will get lost for sure because many of these streets and alleys do not appear on Google Maps. What I really liked about Dharavi is the fact that the majority of the people actually work, they struggle, they try to move forward and they don’t just sit down doing nothing. Everywhere you look, you’d see so many people doing something. I enjoyed watching groups of women, happily sitting down together, rolling dough and then put them to dry in the sun on some things that look like big Vietnamese hats. That's the way they make papad. There is a big plastic
In Pune with Devangi and Saiprasad
recycling industry in Dharavi which provides work for a lot of people. We had the chance to enter into one of the recycling places where we got an ample explanation about the industry. Other major industries include clay potting and embroidery. The working conditions are far from good and healthy. We were told that they have safety equipment, but most employees don’t want to use them because it gets very hot. We also visited a community centre opened by the tour company where they have a classroom but since it was Sunday, there was no class. The tour finished at the main office of the company from where we were brought back to the train station.


The next day I took a sleeper-bus to travel further to the north. It was a pain in the ass to get a bus-ticket. I wanted to travel by train but the trains do not run every day. The main problem with the bus was the fact that I couldn’t book it online because they do not accept international credit cards. I called them but I couldn’t understand the guy because of his accent, so I decided to send an e-mail instead.

They called me the next morning and said that they’re going to deliver the ticket where I was staying and I had to pay in cash, which was an excellent service! More from India in the next blog!

I am not a big fan of Chinese Food, but yesterday I was bored of routine food...wanted to try something new. So I asked Rahul if we can have Chinese for Dinner today. Rahul hates Chinese food, but he somehow agreed to go. Shraddha, my teammate who is big fan of Chinese had suggested me to try Sudit Su. So we left from home walking towards dahanukar colony.

Suditsu is a decent place for having Chinese food… It is located at starting of lane 3 in dahanukar Colony, Kothrud.

It’s a simple outdoor seating place with no ambiance and facilities. The seating is of simple tables and plastic chairs. Food is amazing, yet hygienic. Taste is very nice…and not just artificial flavors or coloring. Service is also fine, much better than expected from a Street Food Joint. Rates are quite reasonable and the portions are sufficient for 2!

We ordered Veg. Lung Fung Soup, Veg. Manchurian and Veg. schezwan Rice. Everything was good in taste and steaming hot, as we like it..!!! Over all Sudit Su is a place to have hygienic and tasty Chinese food with reasonable rates. Just you have to compromise with the ambiance and facilities.



Sudit Su is worth a try…!!!

Bhakti's Farm party
Rahul-My hubby and his team mates along with Families were invited by a team mate – Bhakti for a Hurda Party at her Farm in Nannaj, Solapur. The plan was set for valentine Weekend. This was going to be a super fun–filled weekend.

A batch left early morning in Pooja’s Wagon R to visit Akkalkot, a temple near Solapur. Virat and Nikhil left from Pune on their Thunderbird…

Rest all of us, i.e. Rahul, Me, Parag, Rohit and Mrudula set-off in Rohit-Mrudula’s Volkswagen Polo on Saturday afternoon towards Solapur from his home in Bibwewadi, Pune. The 4-lane Pune – Solapur Highway is newly built and is in good condition. We stopped at Lamboti for tea break and moved towards Nannaj through the Vadala road, took a left turn from Lamboti. We reach Bhakti’s home – a big wada, within 4 hours from Departure, around 6:00 PM; all thanks to Rohit’s cool driving skills…J

We were warmly welcomed by Bhakti’s Mother and were served hot steaming tea immediately. Then we all went to see the farms which were 2 KM from her house. When we reached the farms, the sun had already set, and it was getting dark. We
Bhakti's Farm
parked our vehicles in the farm and started walking towards center of her park, marked by a big tamarind tree through the grape vineyards. It was really awesome experience to walk through the grape vineyards in evening, after sunset. We reached the tamarind tree and met Bhakti’s Father there, who is really awesome and gracious. He told his men to serve grapes to us, and the men served us with many grapes in big containers…I took a grape from the bunch and ate it, and oh my god…what the heavenly taste it had…I was super pleased by that very single grape…and I ate as many grapes possible for me to eat at a time…. J

We stayed there, chatting for long time….Enjoying with friends and enjoying the Grapes…. In the meantime, Virat forced Mrudula, who is a trained in music, to sing a song; she sang a romantic hindi melody - Lag ja gale, and gave our ears the best musical treat ever…

We all girls left from the farms and reached Bhakti’s home in Mrudula’s car and had a yummy homemade dinner there…and then started playing cards and doing Gtalk, wink wink… Boys had their drinks and dinner at the farms. They arrived home around 11:00 PM… We divided ourselves in 2 teams and started playing dumb-charades… Parag – Rahul’s Team Lead, was the most active player in the game and was very well enacting the movie… He is an encyclopedia of Bollywood movies as he also guessed the movies so quickly when others were enacting... J Later at around 4:30 AM, we went back to our rooms, not to sleep, just to gossip more… J

We woke up around 7:30 AM and were served hot tea and yummy breakfast by Bhakti’s Mother. Around, 9:00 AM, the India-Pakistan Work-Cup match started and we all were glued in front of the TV Set till the Lunch time of the Match. We went to Bhakti’s Farm again today, to have Hurda.

We parked our cars in the farm and now for the first time, we were able to see the grape vineyards clearly. It’s a pleasure for eyes to see the bunch of grapes hanging over the vines. We reach the Tamarind tree, and went to see the well in the farm. Seeing the clear waters of the well, boys decided to go swimming in the well. Rahul Jumped in the well, and was followed by Virat, Rohit and Nikhil. While boys were swimming, we girls were enjoying video shooting them and encouraging them to swim more.

After a long swimming session, everyone was hungry and excited to snack upon Hurda.

Tender, moist, green, farm fresh, aromatic and wholesome – that is what hurda all about. Hurda is the Maharashtrian name for the roasted green millet. Dec, Jan and Feb are the only exclusive months, when hurda delicacies are available to tantalize your taste buds. Hurda makes a super, healthy seasonal cereal grain in your snack platter. Around this time of the year, the jowar chaffs are freshly plucked by the farmers and roasted on coal or dried cow dung in the mud ovens. A few minutes after this slow and natural cooking, you will hear a crackling sound, indicating that the roasted delicate seeds are ready to make their appearance.

The hurda was then served hot, sprinkled with peanut- garlic chutney, accompanied with jiggery and dry coconut. We were enjoying the way of eating hurda… J Believe me, as soon as you pop up one spoon of hurda and its accompaniments in your mouth, you will experience a melting burst of every flavor and texture– sweet, savory, tangy, spicy, juicy, earthy, crunchy and nutty.

After a long Hurda Session, We started snacking on freshly plucked grapes and tamarind. Then, we set-off to the Grape gardens to capture some snaps…and afterwards went to Bhakti’s home to have Lunch. We were served Wheat Kheer – a Solapuri special Delicacy, Vangyachi Rassa Bhaji – Eggplant Gravy, chapatis, Varan-Bhaat accompanied by Cucumber Salad and Special Solapuri homemade Shenga Chutney. Really, Bhakti’s Mother is Superb… J

We again sat in front of TV watching the India-Pakistan Match. Yippee…We won the match by 76 Runs…Cheers…!!!

Bhakti’s Father gifted us a box of grapes and a packet of hurda. After a nice weekend in Nannaj, we left for Pune in our Cars…Now Mrudula was in Driver’s seat and I was accompanying her in front seat. We were enjoying good songs while driving towards Pune. On the way, we stopped by at Hotel Atithi in Tembhurni, had tea and sandwiches there. It is a decent restaurant.



With all the enjoyment, memories, new friends and great tastes lingering on tougue, we reached Pune by 10:30 PM.

Fiesta Standing at the base of Tamhini Ghat
Tranquil Weekend Road Trip to Dive Agar from Pune



Synopsis of Dive Agar: (Source: Wikipedia)

Diveagar (Dive Agar) is a locale in Shrivardhan Taluka, Raigad district in the Indian state of Maharashtra, approximately 170 kilometres south of Mumbai. The area includes a fishing settlement, a beach, a temple, local businesses engaged in coconut and bettle nut tree farming, and some resort businesses such as restaurants, cottage rentals and motels, and six villages (from north to south): Velās, Musalmāndi, Agar Panchaitan, Diveagar, Borlai Panchaitan, and Kārle.

The golden (suvarna) ganesh murti (idol) of Diveagar Ganpati temple was allegedly stolen by thieves on 25 March 2012. The murthi was later allegedly melted. The golden idol weighed 8.0 kg. The thieves before taking away the golden idol killed the two watchmen who guarded the temple. The idol has since then been replaced by one made with Silver.

Harihareshwar and Srivardhan are also small towns with beach and temples in line to Dive Agar down south.



Fantastic road trip to Dive Agar from Pune by my all-time favorite Ford Fiesta 1.4. Amazing driving experience on Tamhini and subsequent ghats all the way to Harihareshwar, Srivardhan
Getting Ready to explore Sahyadri Hills
and Dive Agar.

1. Total Distance Travelled – 403 Kms

2. Total Fuel – Petrol / Gasoline – 35 Litres – Rs. 2200

3. Route Taken –

a. Chinchwad (Pune) – Hinjewadi – Pirangut – Paud – Tamhini – Mangaon – Harihareshwar – Srivardhan – Dive Agar

b. Dive Agar – Morba – Mangaon – Tamhini – Paud – Pirangut – Hinjewadi – Chinchwad

4. Total Driving – 13 Hours in 36 Hours of trip

Started at 6.45AM on Saturday from Spine Road, Chinchwad with tons of luggage and fully loaded Ford sedan navigating thru Wakad we reached Hinjewadi, passing thru Infosys Phase I, we took outer road which goes parallel to IT cos road of Phase 3. First stop to tank up the fuel off course out of corporation limits to save some bucks and started again with full energy to explore Hinjewadi – Pirangut road and then grand Tamhini. Halted again to check Tyre pressures to assure we go safe thru ghat section.

I was driving first time thru Tamhini and read lot about it in Travel blogs so was careful, however one of my friend assured me of tamhini
Tamhini Base
roads being repaired and to my little surprise roads are now really made like national highways. I was driving at an average of 60 Kms per hour thru tamhini enchanting beautiful nature of Sahyadri hills. Ghat came to an end with lot many photo shoots and we stopped for breakfast at Orchad café – restaurant at the base of Tamhini. Food was good but little expensive. Has good ambiance and play area for children which justify higher cost. We left after 1 hour of food, photo shoot and playing swings at 10.30 from Orchard café.

On the way navigating using google maps, we were sketching plans while playing antakshari to how to spend time and cover three places – Harihareshwar, Srivardhan and Dive Agar. Our final destination was Dive Agar, so we headed for Harihareshwar, as it’s down south to Dive agar and Srivardhan being in middle of two.

We took left just after leaving Goa Mumbai highway in Mangaon – HP Petrol pump is the landmark before which you should take left, plenty of direction boards are available which guide you. Road to Harihareshwar is average:5 -6 Kms ghat section patch is very rough – road is
Pit stop -Other end of Tamhini
under construction and is single lane off course.

After driving thru couple of hair pins and rough patches we reached harihareswar lord shiva temple at 12.45PM, parking is ample but expensive – charged Rs.40 for open ground parking. From parking itself you can see splendid long beach having couple of water sports guys waiting for customers in scorching noon heat. Harihareshwar gram panchyat has made good efforts to make beach and its surrounding look like Mumbai chowpati and have tried to maintain thru Modi’s swachta abhiyan campaign. You can see many placards in and around requesting for swachata abhiyan participation. Before entering temple we pacified our throats by sipping cool lemon sodas, while my daughter took bites of cheese sandwich (off course thanks to my wife who brought from home, you will not get any kind of city food here).

Temple is one of its kind having three linga’s of Shiv, Vishnu and Parwati with adjacent Kalbhairav temple. Temple over looks sea rock on one side and beach on other side. Temple has parikrama (one complete round to temple) path in which you need to climb up 51 steps and 150 steps down to reach Vishnu pad which
Orchard Cafe
is Vishnu’s paduka (foot) formed by water hammering on flat surface. Might be many stories, but I took a scientific way to look at it. We took other way to reach this paduka – which is pretty safe in non-monsoon season; we went thru rock flat surface on which huge sea waves hammers on rock. Had lot many photos here and scene is really awesome with gigantic Arabian sea in front and bed rock greened with lichens all around. We almost forgot that we need to move ahead to Dive Agar and have to search a place to stay! We were drenched with sweat, so had coconut water and kokam to beat the heat.

My red Fiesta also got a good rest and was ready to drive thru sea shore roads to march towards Srivardhan and then Dive Agar. Its 35 kms ride to Dive Agar from Shiva temple of Harihareshwar. Beware, there are two roads to Dive Agar, one is thru jungle and normal road, while other is coastal road. Coastal is best I opted for, not sure about condition of other road. First phase of road is again bad and rough, you go pretty slow thru dense
Vishnu Pad @ Harihareshwar
jungle and ghat section, but from Srivardhan about 10Kms of patch is coastal road and is awesome. There is a small ghat section from where you have sea on left and mountain on right, there is a spot where there is a deep sea and beach on one side and ground level sea (right on your spot) with some fish catching jetties on other side. Splendid view from where we took many snap shots.

Finally we reached our final destination at 4PM, tripmeter showing 223 Kms! Big task was ahead of us – To search for decent and fairly priced hotel / guest house for family! We did look for couple of guest house in lane parallel to Ganesh temple and finally took a decision to stay at Pahunchar guest house at Rs. 1000. Chavan is the name of owner who is quite helpful in guiding you. Rooms were clean and hygienic, but beds were in bad shape with old bedsheets – felt little overpriced for what being offered. Overall okay if you are staying only for one night and want good parking for your vehicle.

Ladies and children took one hour to get ready for beach; we
Hill on one side and steep down sea on other side
went to beach without any gadgets with us as we all wanted to have fun in sea passing thru beautiful Roop Narayan Temple. Beach from Pahunchar is 10 mins walk, though all these motel owners will tell you it’s 3 min distance, but be prepare for 10-12mins walk.

Dive Agar beach is one of the best beaches I have been to. We have decided to visit this beach once every year to spend serene time here. It’s very cool, serene secluded beach – best for family. It was chilling cold water with cold air around so I stood outside water with my daughter who was shivering with cold; taking a look at time less beauty. Fortunately sky was clear and I first time saw soothing – peaceful sun being set in middle of Arabian Sea with no disturbance at all. It gave inner tranquil feeling, in which mind was completely shut off and serene thoughts were running thru heart.

Came back to hotel after having gadget less evening with moments stored in mind and heart. We did try for authentic veg thali at Bapat, but one needs to book thali 24 hours in advance. This was known to
Another View of
me by Travel bloggers, but thanks to my procrastination habit. Family was not interested in thali types anyways and were very hungry as we skipped lunch, so went to Golden Dish restaurant in Borli village which is 2 Kms away from Dive Agar. This is where you get all types of food – Fish, chicken, veg and non veg thalis and what not. My friend had Poplet which he did not like much, but veg punjabi food was at par with what we get in Pune. Again little expensive, but it’s normal now a days at tourist places. I liked the restaurant especially if you have kids – you get everything from soup to juices. They do have AC and non AC halls, off course AC is too expensive but with good comfort and its noiseless.

By the time we reached hotel it was already 9.30 PM, we got refresh again to play cards but we were really tired after eventful day and wanted to make our self ready for another marvellous day so slept early. Next day plan was to wake up at 6AM dress up for beach photo shoot, come back for break fast and go gadget
Awesome Road from Srivardhan to Dive Agar
less again to play on beach! This was a plan with brisk walk to beach to keep my Fiesta clean, neat and away from beach sand! 😉 And to surprise we did exactly as per plan we got up at 6AM; were on spot at 7AM! It was awesome feeling again with sun rising from dense green trees with golden colored sky; sun making its presence over each and every human face on beach. This cool sun light gave us additional motivation for photo shoots!

Cars are allowed on this beach along with horse and camel riders. Some SUVs and cars were riding along water and I was watching them while having sip of coffee. You will get breakfast options on beach itself, so you can go with accessories to seat and have serene morning on beach with food and beverages. We decided to march back to our area as per plan, had breakfast at Gandhe outlet (khanawal) – Poha and omlet was good. We place an order for Ukdiche modak which we planned to eat during lunch time. Modak needs to be ordered in advance and in correct number. It’s not readily available.

Went again to room,
My Red Fiesta 1.4 Standing on hill with Arabian Sea in background
changed clothes to swimming / sea costumes – went to beach. We were told to vacate rooms max by 11AM, but we came back from beach drenched and tired at 11.45am! We were without gadgets, so unaware of timing, to our surprise we played for more than 2 hours in sea water. Ladies were worrying about tanning and salt water reactions, while we guys were worrying about check out timing and answers we need to give to motel owner – Mr. Chavan! But Chavan was cool and did not speak anything about check out time, might be because no new customer was waiting for us to vacate room. We checked out finally at 12.45pm with 20 minutes time spent in watching last part of India Innings. We were really missing India Pakistan crucial match. We then headed for Ukdiche Modak which we ordered in morning, carried in hand and went to Rane Khanawal for Egg and Fish thalis. Average taste at least for egg thali, decent priced, but we had faster lunch compared to Punjabi dish last night. Again had a look at Pakistan batting score and headed for Suvarna (golden) Ganesh Temple from where we started our return journey
Beach Road, Dive Agar
at 2.30 pm. My Fiesta was ready with half tank full and wind shields clean from dust!

Return route goes from Morba to Mangaon and then Tamhini – I was little heavy eyed and somnolent due to exhausting beach fun, modaks and full lunch, but funny antakshari and college time stories kept me up and driving to Mangaon. We took a halt here in Mangaon with refreshing tea and interesting chat with tea vendor giving fresh energy to start again. To give you a glimpse of chat with vendor about Mangaon – It’s a small emerging town of Raigad district about 190 Kms from Mumbai and 112 Kms from Pune located on Mumbai – Goa Highway and crucial station for Konkan railway. All this makes it attractive destination for trading and it’s going to be a mega city of Raigad – In very near future all govt offices are going to move to Mangaon from Alibaugh and other areas; making this town an investment epicentre.

Haah, enough of chat and we headed with fun stories and sing songs towards Tamhini again. I was bit sceptical about driving up on hair pins, because when I drove steeping down from
Entry to Beach
hair pins, I was worried about driving back again! But I kept on waiting for those difficult hair pins and in half an hour tamhini was over! Again Tamhini is tamhini nothing can beat this beautiful nature here! Planned already to visit this beautiful sahyadri nature again in monsoon.

We stopped at Pirangut to pick up beers and reached back home in Chinchwad at 7.15pm, driving thru evening Wakad – Chinchwad traffic. Celebrated our perfect weekend and India victory with 3 beers; had dinner watching trip photos – cherishing moments and memories.

36 Hours of trip, 13 hours of memorable driving, 7 hours of sleep - Unlimited Fun! J

This road trip gave confidence in driving my Fiesta in rough and hilly roads – next is the plan for Coastal Karnataka road trip. Thanks a ton to Travel bloggers for guiding me to plan this awesome weekend!



Cheers

Guess who's taxi this is...
Well today turned out to contain more than we bargained for! We asked the hotel concierge to get us a taxi to go to Lower Parel for no other reason than I had read it supposedly has 'little plazas of activity in one of most up and coming areas of Mumbai. The former cotton mill exported to England...and is now transformed to a relaxed and trendy development'. I should have stopped when the first concierge we asked had never heard of it! But a more experienced one said yes he would get a taxi and it would cost 600 Rupees ...so off we went. An hour later we were still crawling through honking traffic when the driver told us it would cost 80 rupees to go over the Ravi Gandhi sea bridge...which was actually quite a spectacle..,being 9 km long over the Arabia sea. Then another half hour brought us to our destination. It was a modern shopping mall we could have seen in any city! We agreed to meet the driver two hours later for the return as we thought that maybe as we were so far from our hotel across a bridge we might have difficulty finding someone to
Mumbai homes
take us back. So we walked around.,, had coffee in Costa went to Marks and Spencers most of the other shops were designer labels! Our driver duly arrived and we started back. Two miles on the taxi air conditioning stopped, another mile or so the car over heated..we were parked under a motorway under construction with traffic passing us on both sides. We ended up stopping 3 times...finally the driver left us and went off to buy some cenent stuff to repair the header pipe of the radiator. So they say everythinghappensfora reason and I wanted to see more of life in Mumbai...and I certainly got my wish this afternoon sitting in a broken down taxi all of life passed me by in three different locations. I am eternally grateful for being born in England!

December 2014
Now I've had the time of my life...

No I never felt this way before..!



Hello All!

How often do we make a to-do list for our self, for the city we live in! Well I had never done that before..! I virtually spent my November, 2014 doing this..! Searching for places to go/things to do when I have my ""Bro-Time"" in December!! I traveled to Mumbai from Pune to celebrate Christmas eve with my folks! Excited and happy I was, looking forward to make the most out of the coming 10 days! We set out towards Marine Drive for Pizza by the Bay! Amazing ambiance, by the Bay.. good feel! After a good supper and a round of toast to many more such evenings, and as the clock was about to strike for midnight, we moved towards the nearest church, to say hello to the new born! Once there we figured out we were pretty close to colaba, so we went in for a stroll and reached the Gateway! The coast here was pretty silent, not many people around, but then there was our big group of 6! Not sleepy anyway, we decided to awaken
Pizza By The Bay
ourselves further and made way for late night coffee at The Taj! Okay Coffee, Okay Ambiance, Decent Service, Amazing Company, Too Much Laughter..!

I always wanted to see a play, I had never seen one ever! So when in Mumbai, The Mecca of Indian art and drama; why not check that off the bucket list too.. So we zeroed down to a comedy art at ""Prithvi"". The point to be noted is that the play was in Urdu!! Prithvi Theatre with its cozy seating and the play with its punchline.. ""kyunki... alaah k hoozoor"" entertained me completely on December 25th, 2014! Since we had time before the play we decided to walk past the Bandra/ Bandstand Promenade, and yes I had cutting chaai too..I surely was having the time of my life, doing what I had never done before! I din't know cutting chaai was small/half sized glass of tea. We also came across a wonderful bakery called Hearsch Bakery ( J. Hearsch & Co.).. The bakery looked like the canteen of an abandoned school/college. I loved it completely and it was pretty low on cost too!

And then on the Saturday Night we went to Barking Deer,
Prithvi Theatre
a microbrewery in Vile Parle, where we were joined by a few more friends. Once back the tempo remained and we had a night of endless banter! Since we were in no mood to give up on the laughter, we went in for a Stand Up Comedy at the Blue Frog. I wouldn't say a great show of comedy but we did have a great time! Right across the street, was Smaash - Mumbai Indians club! Roof Top Go Karting; Cricket Simulation and Bowling, I found it cool, really cool!

Next day we went to Colaba, and on the way we enjoyed a Pav Bhaji meal at Victoria Terminal. After enjoying the ""Bombayness in Colaba"" we made our way to ""Leopold Cafe"". The cafe has a charm of its own, be it day or night. To complete the trip we went to ""Theobroma"" for our puddings and pastries! And then comes the most exciting part. Since we were putting up in Navi Mumbai; more often than not we relied on the Mumbai Local as our means of quick transport. On the journey back on the last day in Mumbai for this trip, barely five minutes of travel, The Local
Smaash
stopped! Oh yes it did..And then it did not move, and then there was no cab! It was like Mumbai had come to a halt. We spent more than an hour and half to find a cab, pooling it with other navi mumbai inmates.



Next day, December 29th,2014 we made a move to Pune. I slept all through the way, while my friend gazed through the western ghats! I decided to start his pune travel with the Camp area,as I like the local maharastrain snacks served here; from misal pav to dabeli. We also went to Marz-o-rin, just opposite to budhani bakery. Marz-o-rin is on the first floor; gave a hill station cafe feel to me primarily because of its seating, lights and menu! Will strolling across the contonment area we next happened to reach the 11 East Street Cafe. It was an amazing place, I am talking about the set up. The cafe is made in the form of an english street, the entrance has a red truck serving chocolate assortment; followed by the contemporary phone booth and then the food counters accompanied by lively music and people. We sat there for more than an hour
Marz-o-Rin, Pune
enjoying ourselves to the core.

When in Pune you do Thank Shri Dagdu Seth Halwai; for letting you travel; being happy and enabling us to make most of the life we have! So January 1st Twenty Fifteen started with this; After our thank yous we headed to Fergussan College Road. The lane has the energy and excitement of the college goers! Its chilled out yet always in trance. My travel is complete only if I have had the local cusine, worn the local outfit and learnt a few local words! So to complete my travel, we went in next to have authetic maharastrian thali at ""Shabri"".. what colorful food.. I was too happy to look my plate, and was my tummy happy..? ""Ho""

Pheonix happens to be the largest mall in Pune, housing all major brands! So when we went to Pheonix, we did shop but what we loved more was the ""WoW Momo"".. It was indeed wow, serving so many, I repeat so many varities of momos! Not dat I wud ever get bored of the usual one, but variety is always appreciated.. So what did I have? Well I had fried momos, curry momos, choco momos,
Dagdu Seth Halwai
and a moburg (momo burger)!

The last weekend of the ten day tour was kept for Lavasa! But before starting the Lavasa travel, we stopped at the German Bakery for our brunch! German Bakery with its small yet elegant set up was even more apealing on a bright sunny day. We enjoyed some hot dogs and burgers and rainbow pasteries and started our 70 km long pune lavasa travel.. As we moved away from the city and start nearing lavasa, the sun was on its way off work! The temperature had come down, roads became better and you see some dams on your way! We reached lavasa around 6! Walked around the town hall near water front shaw! We saw a lot of people enjoying the breeze on their cycles. We thought of doing the same and hence set out to search if they were available for rent. Guess what, we could find the cycle renting shop, but we could not find was the shop owner to rent us the same! So after having Shwarma for dinner we left for pune!

That sums up the winter break for me; Christmas 2014 and New Year 2015!

Not a very eventful day for cam, everything started good enough. went for a delicious breakfast at a local cafe and were headed to chow patty beach to have a look. Fifteen minutes into the walk... Delhi belly! Nothing too serious just a little nausea.

I set up shop in the hotel and rested my way through it.

Candace was still able to enjoy her day, heading out to the cafe for a drink and some reading.

8pm and already feeling much better. Got my appetite back. We both went out and got some fresh fruit to have for dinner.

Tomorrow should be a lot more eventful.

teenagers @Chowpatty Beach
From Bangalore we had a very cheap early morning flight with GoAir to Mumbai. It was a very efficient, comfortable and nice flight in news planes - we were positively surprised as we had expected the worst for the cheap price. In Mumbai we looked again for Meru Cabs. If you want to avoid the typical taxi rib off, we experienced Meru Cabs as the perfect way to go. And again, for 400 Rupees we reached safely our hotel in Central Mumbai, the Kumkum Hotel. Coming from a wonderful and personal homestay, arriving in the hotel we were really disappointed about our small room. But to be honest, Hotel Kumkum is a really good deal in Mumbai. Mumbai in general has the most expensive accomodation in India and we think one will never quite feel like one is getting one's money's worth. This is thanks to Mumbai's real estate! So, back to our hotel - the room was really small, but it was clean (and if you wish they clean daily), the shower was hot (although it was hard to turn around in the tiny bathroom). Anyway, the staff was incredibly friendly and luggage could be kept in the storage for free.

On the top floor there is a small restaurant where you can have breakfast and snacks, there is free WIFI. So, our basic needs are more than fullfilled. After all, the hotel has a perfect location. Most of the sights are within walking distance or easily reached by train (the station is close by). Without problems we could check into our room at 10 am without any extra charge.

First we settled down for breakfast and decided what to do first in Mumbai. For the same day, we decided to start with a walk towards the west coast (the Mahalaxmi area) to visit the Haji Ali Dargah. This exquisite Indo-Islamic shrine is one of Mumbai's most striking symbols floating off the coast. It can be reached over a long causeway into the Arabian Sea. It was a very nice introduction to Mumbai. Already on the way to the coast we passed by a lot of street food stands for which Mumbai is famous for. In Central Mumbai there is also a lot of construction work going on. You can see very old ruins of houses next to modern skyscrapers. It was really interesting. The minute we stepped on the
@ the Bhuleshwar market
streets from the hotel we could feel this special vibe of the city. You can really feel that everybody is running for his/her life. It is like a rat race. Each individual, no matter on which level, is running to survive and to make money. People are not rude to others but they just try to make an advantage out of each situtation. As a visitor you can either fight it (especially the thousands of rickshaw and taxi drivers who try to rib you off) or you can surrender. We decided to surrender and take things like they are but to be careful playing the game. It turned out to be a good decision. We never had any major problems with anyone.

After the mosque we visited the Mahalaxmi Temple, one of the busiest and most colourful temples in Mumbai dedicated to the goddess of wealth - very suitable for money mad Mumbai! From here we made a quick stop for a delicious fruit shake at the Haji Ali Fruit Center (not cheap but amazing!) and walked up north. We passed a small slum area and the Mahalaxmi racecourse till we reached Mahalaxmi train station. From here, one has

a great view over the Mahalaxmi Dhobi Ghat. This is a 140-year-old place where clothes are washed. Well, one can say that this is Mumbai's oldest and biggest humanpowered washing machine. The sight was really impressive! As we were at the train station, we took the train down south to the Marine Lines Train Station. From here we walked along the Marine Drive and finally sat down on the Girgaum Chowpatty for people and sunset watching. It was a wonderful sunset and sitting here in front of the Arabian Sea we somehow started to fall in love with this dirty, crazy, chaotic and fascinating city. Before it was getting really dark we walked back to our hotel and had a delicious veg thali dinner in a small restaurant close to the hotel. Later the evening when all shops were closed we walked back to the hotel. Rats (really huge ones) were running along the streets, poor people were making themselves ready to sleep in the dirt and expensive cars like Jaguar and Bentleys were passing by. Well, this is Mumbai. It is shocking, it is fascinating - but it is definitely a rat race, everyone is running after money and

success (just the amount of it differs for each person).

The next morning we started slowly, as we had a long day and a lot of things we wanted to see. After a breakfast in the hotel we walked along the Falkland Road. First it was perfect - and then it suddenly started turning to the bad. We realised that the atmosphere suddenly was a bit tense. It took us a few minutes to realise that we were walking right through the middle of the red light district. OK, it was bright daylight. But it was obvious that we were tourists. We tried not to look too lost and quickly decided to keep walking steadily and firm. We changed from the boardwalk to the middle of the street, as we thought that the chance that someone just pulls us into a sidestreet is a bit smaller when you walk in the middle of the street. The prositutes warned us not to walk in this area and to quickly get out of it. Some strange men looked angrily at us but nothing else happened. Just 200 m later (our longest in India so far) we reached a police station and
old and new in Central Mumbai
directly went into it, just to feel safe for a minute. The street of the red light district was only about 500 - 600 meters long and the police station was at the end of this area. A policemen confirmed us that we will be safe if we kept walking straight to where we wanted to go. Wow, how lucky are we! Tourists have disappeared in this area - but nothing happened to us! We have to admit, our knees were shaking a bit. The rest of our walk was fine and we safely made it to the real heart of old Bombay: the markets and temples in Bhuleshwar. Here, we visited the Bombay Panjrapole. This is an oasis in the middle of the bustling market and it is a shelter for 300 homeless cows. We could wander around, pet the cows and calves and we were even allowed to feed them without anyone asking for money. It is a great project and the cows live there in really good conditions (considering you are in the middle of Mumbai!). We walked around the markets. All things you need for a temple - you can buy them here! And so much
Central Mumbai impressions
more! You can get EVERYTHING and more! The markets are unbelievable and we enjoyed every minute. Finally we went to the Mumba Devi Temple, the deity that gave Mumbai its name. As we got tired of the bustling markets and the crowds of people we took a train at the Masjid Train Station to the famous Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (Victoria Station). The building, a Unesco World Heritage building, is impressive, a beautiful piece of colonial architecture. We walked around a bit and then quickly and hungrily went for having a nice lunch in the area. In the afternoon we walked passed Flora Fountain and around the Kala Ghoda area, an area full of cafes, bars, restaurants and art exhibitions. We loved the atmosphere and relaxed with a typical english tea in the afternoon. Afterwards we admired the wonderful colonial buildings of the Mumbai University, the Rajabai Clock Tower, the High Court.... In this area Mumbai is totally different to Central Mumbai. In the Oval Maidan, a huge parc, younger and older teams were playing cricket. For sunset we walked back to the Chowpatty before we took a train from the Churchgate Train Station back to the hotel. We relaxed a
tailors are everyhwere
bit and then, it was time to meet a friend. I, Nina, had met Abbas about 5 years ago in Melakka/Malaysia. We had spend one evening together in the lobby of a guesthouse drinking some beer and talking about life. A year ago, Abbas found me on Facebook. And now, we were about to meet him. He lives with his parents just a short walk away from our hotel. So we walked to his place. It was great to see him again. He had prepared some delicious bhelpuri for us. This is a veggy dish with lots of savoury gravy and very buttery bred. It was sooooo yummy! We enjoyed it a lot and talked about what happened in our lives and what he is doing now. He had learned german in the meantime and really could speak very well! What a good evening!

The next day was our last day in India on this trip. As our flight was about to live early the next morning and we had to leave to the airport at midnight that day we had no room for the day. But we could leave our stuff for free in the hotel. By train
street food
we travelled down to the Churchgate Train Station and walked to Colaba, the famous tourist area of Mumbai. Well, we have to admit, we have also read Shantaram.... And, as we passed, we had a glimpse at the Leopold's cafe. Maybe this was a great place for a beer in the afternoon before the book became famous. Now it is packed with tourists at all times and we did not feel like going in there. We walked around the Colaba area, visited the market - but this area did not touch us. We preferred the markets north of the Victoria Terminus. Anyway it was nice and we found a cool and fancy restaurant for a quick lunch. Then we walked around the beautiful Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and went to the Gateaway of India. We expected a lot of hassle of other indian tourists wanting to take pictures of and with us. We have heared a lot of stories from other tourists. But no-one was asking us a single picture. No seller wanted to sell us stupid things. We were left in peace at one of the busiest tourist spots in India! Very funny. So we really could enjoy this
near the Haji Ali Dargah
place. We spontanously decided to take one of the boats to Elephanta Island. It is a one hour ride to reach this Unesco World Heritage Site and it was worth crossing the waters for it. On the island there is a labyrinth of cave-temples carved into the island's basalt rock. It has some of the most impressive carvings in India. And indeed, it was very nice and interesting. The temples are thought to have been created between AD 450 and 750! Really amazing. We enjoyed it a lot. Even the guides were not so aggressive as we expected them to be. I think, in the meantime we are used to many things in India and some sellers do not bother us any more ;-). We took the boat back and could enjoy a wonderful sunset over Mumbai. It was peaceful and a great way to end our visit here! To end the day, we went back to our friend's home. We were welcomed by him and 2 other friends. We chilled a bit together before we went out for dinner at the Chowpatty. It was a fantastic dinner with delicious food again. Oh, how we will miss the indian food!
Markus on the way to the Haji Ali Dargah in the Arabian Sea
After dinner, Abbas drove us up the hill to the Banganga tank close to the Hanging Gardens. This is a very posh part of Mumbai. But the temples around the tank are really peaceful and older and the atmosphere at night was wonderful. But then it was time to say goodbye to our friend Abbas. He drove us to our hotel and promised to visit us next year in Switzerland! Hey, this would be so great! We took our bags and the night boy of the hotel even helped us to find a taxi for a fair price. We had to pay 500 rupees to the airport at night, a great deal!

We were really sad to leave Mumbai and India. We will come back to this crazy city. There is so much more to be discovered. Our trip around South India was fascinating, sometimes difficult, sometimes ridiculous, sometimes funny, sometimes beautiful. To put it short: it was an indian trip with lots of different facettes. This country is fascinating. We will be back, this is for sure....

Day 14
This morning we both woke up before the 10am alarm, surprisingly!
I laid on my bed for a while, not daring to put my feet to the floor for fear of falling over! When I did finally pull myself together, I did a bit better than I expected to! Tom is also suffering, but he seems to be going better than me.
We are still in awe of last night. It was just so good to have the three of us back together again, although we did miss Judy!
We finally managed our last cold shower, and to get our bags packed ready for leaving. The man at the hotel was reasonable; he let us leave our bags there until we leave. I thought that was good of him considering we got him up to open the door at 2.30 this morning!
We started off the day by going to Cafe Mondy for a good breakfast, but also because they have a decent Wifi connection! We then went for an easy walk up to India gateway, but we were both on a bit of a downhill slide by then. We were struggling with the hangover and the heat! We found a small retreat at a Belgian coffee shop which was situated nicely in the shade. We stayed there for a couple of hours, although we did get quite a few random photos taken of us. It has been a regular situation throughout our time here, Indians just love yo pose with Westerners! So as we sat hanging and sweating it out, they randomly say with us, took a few snapshots, shook our hand, then moved on! What can you say ...lol
Finally it was our time to leave. I am certain that we will be back!

Note to Tom
Thanks Tom for being a first class travel buddy. I have enjoyed every minute of our time travelling together. You were a star, and a gentleman throughout.
I loved that we were always on the same level; us both knowing what the other one needed - time, space or quiet etc.
I enjoyed every trip, taxi, delay, highlight, issue and of course, even the emergency landing!
I will cherish every moment of our times spent on each roof top and balcony. Sharing our thoughts, and philosophies in life ..... and about leggings (lol)
I'm sure we'll be back Tom. Thank you for being you xxx

Day 13
Today was a lazy 8am rise, followed by another cold shower. I feel cleaner than before I got in, but not as clean as I would like to feel!
Our aim today is to see the Dhobi Ghats, Dharavi Slums and Mani Bhavan - Ghandi House.
But first, breakfast at Cafe Monde.
Ghandi House was successful, but the Dhobi Ghats was not what we expected! The driver knew I was not happy. He took us to look over to a bridge to take a photo! We sucked it up, and started again!
Before we set off for the second time, we had a treat in Cafe Coffe Day, the most incredible chocolate cake with ice cream, accompanied by a luscious ice cream drink! We got another tour person for Dharavi, but he also agreed to do Dhobi Ghats, but inside this time!
I was very pleased with the driver, we saw as much as we saw earlier, but it was also different to my last visit. I still remain of the same opinion; the Indian people, their lifestyle, and their work ethic are so inspirational in such adversity.
Tonight we are meeting Ankur at Leopolds cafe, can't wait!
And
image
it happened .... OMG... Met Ankur at six at Leopolds Cafe ...... We had the most surreal night ! We drank, had dinner with the group, and partied on down.... Until two....ish
It was clear......Tom, Ankur and I were so pleased to be back together. It was just like we had never left each other. Both Tom and I wanted it to go on, and on, and on! We got on so well with Aunty G, Lisa and Aleisha, just naturally.... Only one word for this, you know what I mean Tom.....wwwwoooooaaaawww...... And I know in my heart ..... We'll be back !

Day 12
New Years Day..... Wwooaawww. We had an unbelievable experience watching New Year's Eve unfold last night. Incomparable to the events that may have occurred if I had spent it in UK!
I can safely say that we enjoyed the diversity that this culture offers.
Today we opted for an 8 0'clock start. Given that we were drinking last, night I was not sure if I would be able to manage it, but I did!
Today we are flying to Mumbai. We took s tuk tuk to Chudi, then the local bus to Margoan, then changed bus to the airport bus. It was a very easy journey that cost 60 rupees each, instead of 1000 each by taxi! The flight was delayed. We finally got seated on the plane, both Tom, and I fell asleep for the whole flight. I think last night finally caught up with us. We decided to take a taxi to the hotel. We arrived at Volga Hotel at about 6.30pm. We checked in to our 'economy' room, checked the shared bathroom. It is basic, but do-able. I think none of my friends could do this.... lol
After taking cold showers and settling in; we set

off for a walk.
We were ready for food, before exploring. We found an eating place that looked reasonable. I really enjoyed falafel wrap and iced tea. A pleasant find! After eating we went for a long walk. We started at the Taj Mahal Hotel, and The Gate of India. They both looked positively regal. They way they look is enhanced by lighting. There were lots of admirers of these two majestic buildings. You can't help yourself.... You just have to stand.... And gaze in awe of these buildings! Tom and. Have joked for a few days now about staying in the Taj..... I am sure ..... If I hadn't lost my purse with cards in it, I would have definitely treated us to just one night! ..,. Maybe next time!
We continued waking up towards Marine Drive.
We could see bright lights and well dressed people, surrounded by colours, flowers, lights and beautiful drapes. As we got closer, we could see it was a wedding ceremony. We weren't lucky enough to go in, but took a great photo of the elaborate entrance.
We made our way back to the hotel for a well earned sleep.

Asia » India » Maharashtra » Mumbai » Juhu
December 8th 2014
Published: December 10th 2014


Sari - check, Tilak - check => ready for the temple
in my room at the Iskcon
India for the second time - we were quite curious what India had to offer us this time. It started with a strange and complicated flight: Zurich to Amann, Amman to Dubai, Dubai to Mumbai due to some flight changes. I (Nina) was travelling nearly 3 weeks in advance for another ayurvedic treatment. Markus will join me for the last days of the treatment and after we will go on the road together for another 3 weeks.

It was pleasantly cool when I stepped out of the plane in the morning in Mumbai. Happy that my luggage had arrived with me, I took it slowly. I was tired from the night in the planes and airports and not really ready to face the famous taxi hassle in Mumbai. Luckily, the arrival hall was empty. So I found an ATM and then I started to ask for the price of a prepaid taxi to Juhu. 1.300 IR was the answer. I had already checked that a taxi to Colaba, which is a much longer journey, is about 600 IR - and I tried to bargain. But with theses guys this is impossible. So I went to the famous Meru Cab in
What they say in the Iskcon: ""Sing Hare Krishna and be happy!
the arrival hall. They have metered taxi - correct ones according to the Lonely Planet (yes, sometimes the LP is useful)! I had to pay a 80 IR fee and got a voucher for the cab. SO I just decided to take this risk. The driver was very nice, showed me the meter without me asking for it (I already had an eye on it). The journey was about 30 minutes in rush hour and finally it cost me 200 IR in total. Here we go! I can only recommend Meru Cab!

And here I was - in the Ashram, or better: the Iskcon Temple in Mumbai. I had booked a room for one night and was greeted with great smiles and ""Hare Krishna"". I wanted to experience this temple with all its ceremonies as I good start of a quite spiritual trip this time. And what a start it was!

I settled down, took a shower and went outside of the temple to buy some water and some snacks to eat till lunch. As it was quiet at the temple, I decided to walk to the nearby beach. Juhu beach was really pleasant. I got some nice
Iskcon in Juhu
views of some parts of this mega city and went for a little walk. For lunch I went back to the temple and enjoyed some holy food (blessed by Krishna himself). It was delicious and a lot! After a short sleep, the first Aarti ceremony started. The temple is really beautiful with great murthis (statues of the gods). It was very impressive and really cheerful. I had put on my sari and had made my tilak (sign on the forehead). Well, for all those who do not know this: we regularly go to a temple in Switzerland and sometimes also visit our guru Sri Swami Vishwananda. So it was not new for me getting dressed up and taking part in the ceremony. But being the only white person in the temple, it was definitely a new experience for the others that I took part in the ceremony and even knew how to dance and chant. But after some starring I was in the middle of the action which was nice, cheerful and very lively. Finally a Swami found me and started talking to me. He was quite impressed what I told him about my spiritual experiences. So he showed me
another temple across the road from the Iskcon
around the temple, explained everything to me and finally brought me to the private rooms of Sri Swami Prabhuprada, the founder of the temple. He died in the 1970s. Now, only few people can visit his private rooms in the temple. So I was really blessed. I took the chance to meditate there for some time and could feel a wonderful energy. Later, I went down again to the main temple for other ceremonies. The later the evening the livelier the ceremonies were. There was loud singing and dancing and a lot of people were around. All were blessed individually by the Swamis. There were snacks offered. It was an amazing experience

There was even a wedding in another part of the temple. I could not see a lot of the wedding as it was private. But all the guests were sleeping (or mainly talking and slamming doors) on my floor. So it was really loud. But I was so very tired of the night before without sleep that I managed to fall asleep deeply. The next morning I met the Swami again who showed me around. He gave me a book of the temple as a present and
on the way to Juhu Beach
a lot of videos and songs which I could copy on my computer.

I had to leave much to early. I would have loved to stay another night. But I had my flight to Kochi. The next day already my ayurveda treatment was about to start.

Unfortunately, it is not allowed to take pictures in the ashram. So sorry for just very few impressions. I promise, the next blogs will be a bit more ""coulourful"".

Hare Krishna!

Asia » India » Maharashtra » Satara
December 7th 2014
Published: December 7th 2014


Train
Kolhapur bound train
Absolutely unplanned! This is how I would describe my trip to Adarki (110 KM off Pune). Adarki is a very small village located in the Satara district of Maharashtra, on route to Kolhapur. Adarki has one of the sharpest curves (the horseshoe curve) on the Indian railway network and is very famous amongst the rail fans, and it is also a paradise for trekkers as it is surrounded by the Western ghats (the Sahyadri mountain range). Besides, I wanted to explore the Pune-Miraj meter gauge route that had been closed down after gauge conversion in 1972. The new broad gauge line is laid upon the old MG alignment which is why there are a lot of spectacular curves and steep gradients.
To trek this place, I was told to prepare at least a week prior but I had no plans until I reached there. On one of those mind-numbing weekends (weekends are boring until I embark on an adventure trip), I packed my backpack after abruptly deciding to go on an overnight trip, booked a waitlist second-class ticket on Mumbai-Pune Deccan Queen express and I was all set for an adventure. As I was about leave my house, I received a
Goods Train
A freight train crossing the picturesque Adarki
text from the Indian railways ticketing system stating that my second-class waitlist ticket has been upgraded to an air conditioned chair car. Oh No!! This was my first reaction. I was totally disappointed and very angry at the auto upgrade system introduced by the Indian railways. Upgrading to a higher class is a bliss for everybody but I hate luxurious travel. Upon reaching the train station, I even thought of asking the ticketing staff to downgrade my ticket to its original class but I figured out that it wouldn't be possible because the train was full. The Deccan Queen express is Indian railway's one of the most prestigious trains - first chugged out on June 1st, 1930. It is fast, has a very few stoppages and is clean and well maintained.
Led by a WCAM-3 class locomotive of Kalyan shed, the train departed on time at 5:10PM however, some reason it was held up for about 5 minutes immediately after departing. The run trough the suburbs of Mumbai was reasonably good with temporary speed restriction enforced, the train didn't even notch up to 90 KMPH for most of the time except at some places where it did cross 100 KMPH mark briefly. The train was running with a delay of about 30 minutes as a result of couple of long unscheduled stops however, surprisingly it reached its final destination, Pune Jn., mere 7 minutes late, thanks to some high speed and all clear run between Lonavala and Pune. From Pune, I boarded a connecting train bound for Satara - a distance of 145 KM. Upon reaching Satara around 2:30AM, I then board yet another connecting train bound of Adarki - a distance of 37 KM. For the first time, I traveled on a luggage compartment of a train. There was no light or fan, absolutely dark, deplorable but I loved traveling on it. I was accompanied by some scally looking guys who were apparently traveling to a nearby village of Lonand. They asked me all sorts of questions ranging from my whereabouts to my family. It didn't affright me at all but lack of sleep was making me stuporous.
I jumped off the train as soon as the train reached Adarki and went to a 'waiting hall' for a much needed sleep. The station manager was very kind as he turned off the lights and let me sleep for an hour.

The return journey to Mumbai was awful because I had boarded a super crowded train and for over 7 hours I couldn't move an inch as a result suffered from severe back pain and muscle cramps, and I was too tied and sleepy - standing by the door of fast moving train. I was lucky that I didn't fall off of the train despite almost sleeping away for a few minutes with a force of hundreds of people pushing me outside. The capacity of carriage was about 102 people however, there were definitely over 200 people inside that carriage and this was the same situation in almost all carriages of the train, except the locomotive hauling it. There were fights, people yelling on top of their voices, and complete chaos yet everybody reached their destination on time - the train was not even delayed by a minute. This is the beauty of the Indian railways, it may be the most uncomfortable way to travel for some people but it will ensure you reach your destination on time for most of the time and extremely cheap to travel. Besides, you meet a lot of people and learn from them about their cultures, language, etc., which is why I am absolutely proud to be an Indian railway enthusiast.

Asia » India » Maharashtra » Mumbai » Bandra
December 3rd 2014
Published: December 3rd 2014


This is my first ever blog.
3rd December,2014,a normal weekday in the city of mumbai; a regular working day for everyone.. It had been 7 days since I was stuck in the 4 walls of my house due to my fever. Finally recovered,time to get out of the house. First day out, and the last thing I wanted to do was spend 3 hours in college. This was rather an unplanned ride. Most wouldn't consider this a perfect travel blog entry, since neither does it involve any special destination, nor a real tour; and I would agree with them but then sometimes, even the smallest of travels leave back something to share, and this ride is no different.



I set out early morning, about 6:30, regular college time and decided to go bandra instead; companions, My Royal Enfield and a backpack; what more do i need! Bandra isn't somewhere that I haven't before, but it is somewhere that I haven't ridden or driven to by myself before. The route to there was pretty much straightforward and easy except for a few turns that I had to take by instinct. It was a hit or miss but it wasn't that tough. Finding the way till bandra by myself after an hour's ride felt like an achievement in itself, but I was only halfway there, the real goal was to explore bandra from the rider's seat. I must say, no matter how many times you sit in the passenger seat and travel to a place, you can only remember the route when you are in the driving/riding seat and today was no different. After getting to bandra, the next idea was to go find Bandstand and ride alongside the beach, because let's be honest, what really makes a bike ride enjoyable is a scenic route and cool breeze. In search for the same I set out in bandra trying to find my way to the beach. Now am going to be honest, it is quite easy to get lost in bandra; I mean most of the streets look just the same, and there are so many one-ways that if you take a wrong turn somewhere you cant just turn back, you have to find another way out. Despite that, I was riding around by instinct just looking for familiar places and signboards. Those 15 minutes or so riding in the insides of Bandra were more pleasant than the whole 1 hour ride I had just made. Bandra, just a beautiful place in itself, covered with lush green trees and the morning sun shining through the leaves, accompanied by the december winter breeze just made it so pleasant, but what came next triumphed even those 15 minutes. After a somewhat instinctive but short ride, I finally saw a road going somewhat downhill and as i started riding down that road, I could already hear the sound of the water. I knew I was there, but i was still in despair, for the road that i just came down was a one way again. However, the despair was short lived for I had arrived where I planned. As i caught glimpse of the sea, ""Oh! What a beautiful sight"", I said to myself. The beauty of the place got me so intrigued, I didn't even notice the pretty girls, out for their morning walk. I rode along the road and kept following it to the end, and it led me back on track again and I found my way out. Apparently my instincts were in my favor throughout the whole ride.



As I made my way back home, it almost felt great to have explored a new place. Only regret was that I did not take any photos but then, Sometimes, if I like a moment personally, I just like to be in it, I don't like the distraction of a camera. All in all, a great ride and an even better reason to start writing travel blogs. Although this is my first, I promise it wont be my last, you will hear from me again. And for the next time I shall try to write about an actual tour.

Alibag village life
This oxen and card was near the ancient jewish cemetery
Another v busy day. Took a ferry to Alibag which cut a 3 hour road journey to 45 mins boat ride. At the end of the jetty on arrival were lots of 'tuktuks' to take visitors onwards. It makes sense as most people don't have cars and are v cheap. Motorcycles are everywhere and we have seen whole families on one motorbike! We travelled through some villages and were able to see that the old ways still thrive.

The Benei Yisrael Jews left Israel 2000 years ago after the 2nd temple was destroyed. They were shipwrecked and lost everything except for 7 couples who survived. Because they had no sefer Torah or religious books, they began to lose their Judaism. But about 1000 years ago Eliyahu Hanavi returned to earth to tell them to improve their religiosity.

We visited the now overgrown cemetery where the first Jews and some more recent ones are buried, with a monument explaining the history. We visited the black rock of Eliyahu Hanavi where his chariot landed and took off again - the horses hoof marks can still be seen, there is a plaque and the site which is in the middle of nowhere
Magenta about synagogue in Alibag
A lovely shul with a fully working mikvah at the rear.
is looked after by a local Hindu man for whom it is also a holy site. And we visited a beautiful, well maintained shul in Alibag. We were shown around by the 84 year old caretaker who told us that normally only 2 or 3 people turn up for davenning. There used to be hundreds of Jews in the town, but nearly all have emigrated, mostly to israel.

There is a web site which tells you all about the history - google Eliyahu Hanavi rock.

We also saw the old soda factory owned by a jewish family. The mezuzah is still on the factory entrance but that too is closed and has been sold. The jewish history is gradually disappearing.

Our drive back took us through some varied countryside - we saw some monkeys - lots of slums and some high rise blocks as we came back to Mumbai.

Mumbai is a fascinating city. A real mix of new and old, busy roads, large open spaces for leisure, nice shops and street sellers. Roads are v congested, mainly with little black and yellow cabs, motor cycles and bikes all jostling to keep moving. pedestrian crossing points are far and few between so people just walk in the road and cross whenever... Somehow it works and at least traffic keeps moving instead of having to stop at crossings!

Friday we visited Elephanta Island, on the way our boat was stopped by the police twice for security checks. The island which is full of monkeys, has man made caves containing enormous carvings of Hindu gods. Made centuries ago and very impressive. On the way back we visited the magnificent Taj hotel and the Gateway to India in the harbour which is a bit like Marble Arch.

Shabbat services were held in a nearby Sassoon funded Baghdadi shul and we had our meals in chabad house - In which 6 were killed by terrorists almost exactly 6 years ago. It's just been refurbished and reopened, but they have not touched the bullet holes. A sad reminder of terror. The people of Mumbai are so welcoming and pleasant.

On our way back to the hotel we passed endless street markets selling everything you can imagine, children sleeping on the pavement, the Sassoon library and the massive crowded railway station built to resemble St Pancras.

A busy schedule but a fascinating and enjoyable one.

Our 9 hour BA flight passed quite pleasantly with two decent kosher meals and unlimited films. We landed at 12.20am and were at our hotel around 2am, passing the new city buildings, the shanty towns and finally those sleeping on the streets.

At breakfast we came across the vegetarian green dot system which helped decide what we could eat. Then we met our guide Chitra who turns out to be a most wonderful, energetic and informative young lady who has made it a mission in her life, for reasons she doesn't understand, to specialise in jewish India tours.

So today, after only 4 hours sleep and 5:30 hours lost in time zones, we were introduced to the diverse, busy, exciting city of Mumbai. We saw 4 shuls, saw how workers get their homemade lunches delivered to their offices by an incredibly clever hand delivery system, get their laundry washed, visited gardens, Gandhi's house and toured the city... V exhausting .

Looking forward to a decent sleep and to a boat trip tomorrow.

P9050696
Murud, maharashtra

For The Lord Ganesh holiday ( long weekend) of September 6-8 a group of teachers decided to rent a bus and head out to Murud off the western coast of India about four hours outside of Mumbai.

We left Saturday morning at around 7 AM after several pickup locations ( first satellite towers then Oberoi woods and finally Elanza, my building!)

The morning was chilly and wet as it had rained the night before. We rode on the highway towards South West Mumbai. The bus ride was smooth and uneventful some people slept while others were goofing around and listening to music.
We stop for breakfast at McDonalds (yuk) I guess working with American teachers I have to accept their choice of food:-( they ate there while I drank coffee and took some photos of the surroundings ( not much). after breakfast we continued on the bus for about 4.5 hours.

The ride and scenery was mostly mountains and a few small fields of rice and other crops and small villages with shops that sold from junk food to vegetables and fruits to clothes and other appliances

Finally at about 1 hour before arriving
P9050697
we started to a see the ocean and beach and palm trees. I took some shots with my small camera which has an action photo setting.

We reached The Golden Swan resort ( 3*** hotel which Melissa and I got a room for $29 cheapest room but had to wait until a few days before the trip for it to be cheap, it was $150 if you booked in advanced).

We settled in our rooms and chilled until lunch which was an Indian buffet quite good actually and it was all included ( except alcohol so we brought our own booze). A few of us decided to go for a walk on the beach. We walked on the sand which was kind of muddy and brownish with some interesting colours and textures, but we found out after that it was very hard to clean and wipe off. As we walked we saw on the right an old Brittish palace ( which Darren told the history of it I guess being a Brittish and an English teacher made him interested. It could. Have been
Cool to go in, but it was now private property and visitors were not allowed.
P9050698
That said we continued to the other side which was more crowded and on the way to the main town. I took some photos of the group, the sand, ocean and some cool shells and then we saw a backbone fossil of a whale. Aidan and Crystal and Jaison took it home as a souvenir. ( Aidan is 8 years old boy) on the way back some people rode a horse carriage, I walked and we all ate lunch.


After lunch we headed to the Jaisera or Jenjira fort which is about 4 km and located on a small island. We got to the main town and walked through alleys and dirt roads which seemed to have put a stop on the clock and it looked like an old 60s town. There were a few shops for food and water and a coconut water vendor from where I got one and drank it as we waited for our ""ferry"" to the fort.

The ""ferry"" was more like a Barka ( Phillippines) or a peñero ( Venezuelan) fisherman's boat only a bit bigger and with a sail. It looked very unstable and rustic. We were about 10 and
P9050709
decided to buy the whole boat cause we were afraid the boat would drown as the local men put in more people than what it could hold the ride was not smooth and very windy and the men had to wiggle and jiggle the sail between sides to get the ferry to sail to the ialand. We reached the island after 30 minutes and the current was very high and lots of wind and waves, to get off we literally had to walk on some rocks and get on the water that reached almost up to my thighs. Then went up some slippery steps and we were in the fort.

( Add explanation of Jenjira fort)

We hired a guide for 200 rupees each and he told us a little of the history of the fort. Most of the fort was in ruins with fallen stone walls and grass and weeds grown into the walls. There was a lake in the center of the fort which was all covered in algae and plastic water bottles ( so sad to see how Indians treat their own country) we hiked for about 1 hour in the sun ( I started
P9050710
to get sunburn so is put sunblock) and wore my safari hat.

We saw some cool cannons and the gate of the emergency escape from the fort. It was very cool and considering I saw Jodhpur , Jaipur, Agra and Udaipur fort I thought this one was among the coolest.

We headed back to catch out ""ferry"" and head back to the resort. This time the ride on the ferry was more relaxing and we took some group photos and chatted it actually took less time ( it helped
To have the wind in our favor)

We walked around some tombs where I hurt my head badly ( had a large goosebump) and then headed back to the hotel.

It was really hot so some people went to beach others napped and played games. I decided to read and chill for a bit in the room. About 5 o clock Melissa and I took a walk into town and and back by the beach. When we returned it was time for dinner. We ate dinner and then played some games, poker and chat. I called it a night around 9 cause the next morning some of
P9050711
us ( me included were going rafting at 6 AM)

Day 2

Melissa, Dave, Crystal, George, Ann, Brunell and I headed on the bus to go rafting. It took about 3 hours to get to the rafting point and we got lost had to use gps and call for directions several times. finally at 9:30 we reached the place and got our rafting equipment heard the rules and procedures and started the rafting. It was a partly cloudy day so the sun wasn't too bad and the river was calm and not too wild. It was a pleasant raft with some exciting and fast rapids , but for the most parts it was relaxing and fun. We saw many bees and large beehives and monkeys on trees and other fellow rafters passing by. Along the banks of the river indian women would be doing house chores: washing clothes, drying long and beautiful saris, washing dishes, etc. Little kids would be running and splashing water and playing in the water.

We got to a point which was the fastest rapid and we all had to lean in the raft or else would have fallen in the river then
P9050716
right after we hit a rock and had to turn the raft backwards to backed up from it. It was exciting!At the end of the rapid we stop at some sightseeing point with other rafters and enjoyed the cool breeze, sunshine and took some nice photos. We headed back and got to a swimming area were we all jumped in the river and swam for about 30 minutes. Me having the underwater camera made it fun to take pictures of everyone goofing, and relaxing. We got in the raft again and paddled to the end point.

When we got to the shore we had to carry the raft on our shoulders to the top of the road. Me being so short literally was doing or carrying no weight. ( I felt bad for the rest but what could I have done? Really nothing!)

The road was filled with food vendors and locals and a bunch of rickshaws carrying on the roof about 3-5 rafts.

We got on the bus and left going towards the hotel.
We got back around 3 o'clock and chilled for the rest of the afternoon and evening in the beach and hotel.
P9050717

Day 3 We woke up at 9 and got ready to leave by 10 AM in order to beat traffic. I got stuck with the last seat of the bus and that was no fun as it we as a very bumpy ride.

After a great weekend a few of the Elanza people. ( Darren, George, Val and me went to grab a beer at a 5***** hotel and chat.

It was a great weekend of new friends and exploring India.

This is going to be a short one, as the title suggests, I only stopped one night.

Mumbai is basically fucking London's buildings with Indian roads Inbetween, not really too much to do either apart from sit in coffee shops, if I wanted to sit in a western coffee shop in a western city I'd still be at home! Fuck Mumbai. Not only this, but nowhere has wifi! For a city so western it's ridiculous that you can't get wifi! The fuck.

I stop in the red salvation hostel, dorm room 350rs, welcome to Mumbai.
The hostel is near the Taj Mahal hotel where the 2008 Mumbai attacks were, and a restaurant nearby ""Leopolds"" is also where people got shot, I'm staying away from there, apparently they sell the fact that there are bullet holes there and stuff, pretty fucked up.

You can also do a tour of some sort into the slums, I'm sorry, but who the fuck is paying to go on a tour into the slums! No thanks, It's very wrong to be paying to go and oggle people because they're poor, a very snobby thing to do.

I go for a wonder to the beach area, the water is disgusting, like most water in India, so I'm not going for a swim, and it's gone dark by this point.
You can see the Bollywood version of Beverly Hills, I go for a walk round there and can't really see any fuck off houses...whatever.

Second day I literally just sat around playing football manager in the hotel waiting for my 11pm train to Goa, that's how boring Mumbai was!
Despite the rumours of food being expensive in Mumbai, I was surprised, cheap food and probably some of the best I've had so far!
Still chasing something spicy enough to blow my fucking mind though!
They must think because I'm white I can't take spice, even when I ask for Indian spice! The search goes on!

Off to Goa! A week of partying all day, sinning all night

Asia » India » Maharashtra » Pune » Bhimashankar
October 14th 2014
Published: February 20th 2015


It was my Birthday; and both, me and Rahul - my husband were on leave. Rahul had his secret plans ready for the Day. So we all set from Home on bike, me being unaware where we were travelling that day.

We traveled our way through Nashik Highway, so I thought whether he is taking me to my Mother’s home in Nashik….??? But, at Rajgurunagar we turned towards Left, and here I came to know we are going to some other place. We traveled through the small villages & Chas Kaman Dam towards Bhimashankar.

Route to Bhimasankar is a diversion from Pune-Nashik highway. Till rajgurunagar (from Pune) the road will be good after that you can't expect a smooth ride. The route was very beautiful;... The drive to Bhimashankar is splendid. You are greeted with various shades of green, yellow flowers and small streams of water flowing from the hills on both sides of the road. At places there are few rocks which add to the beauty of green. I'm sure it must be more beautiful in monsoon. You will forget the passing of time while soaking in the nature's beauty. There was a small waterfall on the way.

The Bhimashankar temple is one of the 12 original Jyotirling temples in India and is a major pilgrimage site. Bhimashankar gets its name from the two things that define its existence – the river Bhima, which originates here, and the temple of Shankar, or Shiv, which gives it importance. The temple of Bhimasankar is on a hill, there is ample parking place present outside temple. We have to climb down a long flight of stairs to reach the temple from the parking area. The way to the temple is well laid with stones and was surprisingly clean too. There are some shops on the way to Temple selling Pooja Thali, Prasad, Flowers and related things.

The temple is not very huge, rebuilt in 18th Century by Peshwas. There is huge Nandi statue in the front of the temple. As we walked into the temple, there were very few people in the queue. Since there was not much crowd, there was no one to hurry us up. So it was a very peaceful darshan, which we had not anticipated. After the darshan we moved out to see what is around.

Bhimashankar is known as a pilgrimage place, but its location in the dense Forest makes it an ideal place for nature lovers and trekking enthusiasts. There are many easy and tough trekking trails around the temple. The trail leading to the origin of the Bhima River is a popular one. We didn't do any trekking as we wanted to reach Pune before Sun-set.

We explored a little around the temple. We took the path to the place where the Bhimashankar linga was originally found, near the origin of Bhima River. This place is called ‘Gupt Bhimashankar’. The trek is a very easy but beautiful, through the dense forests of Wildlife sanctuary. There is no shrine here, but simply a small Shiva Ling on the rocks smoothed by the passage of water over long time. This place is also home for the Shekru - Giant Indian Squirrel, but we spotted none. Bhimasankar has abundant natural beauty; you can spend an entire day here exploring the place.

We returned back to parking and started our way back home on bike. We stopped at Rajgurunagar at about 3:30 for lunch. And then we headed to Pune with loads of photos and memories of the trip and with a decision to go there again next year, during monsoon. And now that we know what to expect there, will explore more around Bhimashankar.

September 19th 2014

Ajanta Caves
Aurangabad had been on my mind since quite some time as I wanted to explore Ajanta - Ellora caves (World Heritage Sites). Had always only heard about it but never got a chance to visit it. So, with help of some travel blogs and trip advisor reviews, we planned for our Aurangabad Visit from 22nd - 23rd - 24th February 2014.

It takes about 5 hours travel to reach from Pune , so we decided to catch a overnight bus from Nigdi (Located about 20Kms away from Pune) . After booking AC sleeper bus tickets from Redbus, we caught a bus at 10:30 PM from Nigdi. After a comfortable ride, we reached Aurangabad city around 6:30 AM and checked in Hotel Oberoi near Osmanpur Circle.

Hotel Oberoi is a very basic clean hotel which seems to have started only couple of years ago. After getting ready, we hired a cab to take us to Ellora caves, Girneshwar temple, Bhadra Maruti, Daulatabad fort, Bibi-ka-Makbara, Pan Chakki for about 1000Rs. Ellora took around 1 hours drive from the hotel to reach.

For Indians the entry ticket is 10 Rs while for Foreigners they charge around Rs. 250. The caves in
Ellora Caves
Ellora are spread out. Ellora caves are about 3 major religion : Jainism, Buddhisam, and Hinduism. There are few important caves which you shall not miss.. Caves 30 - 34, 16 and 10 are the most important and the biggest caves. You can hire a guide, who can give you insights of the history. Not sure about the cost as we didnt hire any guide.

It took good 3 hours for us as well to look around the caves as they are spread out. Also, one more good thing is there are some photographers who click photos and gives you hard copies of the same in 5 minutes and just about 20 Rs per photo. Really worth a try.

After the caves, we went to Girneshwar temple which is just about 1 km distance from Ellora caves. This is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas and being weekend was crowded. We then went to see Bhadra Maruti temple, which means the Maruti is in sleeping position, guess the only one in India. It was a unique temple. After a quick visit to Bhadra Maruti, we went to Daulatabad Fort where we grabbed a quick snack at the foot of
Ellora Caves
the Fort and then walked toward the Fort. There is not much to see inside the Fort but felt good to be in there for sometime.

We went to see PanChakki which can easily be given a miss as its not worth visiting. Its not maintained well at all. Our last stop before heading to the hotel was Bibi-ka-Maqbara. This mausoleum is a replica of famous Taj Mahal, Agra. After spending some good amount of time in and around the structure, we decided to call it a day and returned to our hotel after a long tiring day.

The next day we wanted to visit Ajanta which is about 110 Kms away from Aurangabad and takes abt 2 1/2 hours to reach by ST bus. So we started early and took a 6 AM bus to Ajanta. We reached around 8:30 AM to base of Ajanta, had our breakfast as you dont quite have lot of options at Ajanta caves.

Ajanta Caves is made of 30 Buddhist caves and have been proclaimed as UNESCO World Heritage.After having breakfast, we again took a MTDC bus that takes you to the entrance of the Ajanta Caves.. Once you reach
Ellora Caves
there, you need to buy tickets, climb for abt 10 mins before you actually start seeing the caves...

Caves 1, 2, 16 , 17, 27 are the best caves and will take time.. You can hire a guide or the staff at the entrance is ready to tell you a story of each cave for some money... Govt. Guides charge around 900Rs...

Its a semi circular structure which takes abt 3/4 hrs if you really see it with all the patience.

We reached back at Aurangabad around 6 PM after a very tiring day.

Had dinner at the Hotel Oberoi itself, food being really good. Since we didnt have anything to do on the last day, we took MSRTC bus at 1 PM back to Pune and reached home around 6 AM.

All in All had a really great time looking around the caves and spending some quality time with my husband travelling.

Day 27 exploring Mumbai
We ventured out into Chembur this morning. We agreed we should go for an Indian breakfast as we haven't had one for a while! We settled for Dosa. I had cheese dosa, and Jude masala dosa. A coffee each.. And all was well!
We set off in a taxi to explore Colaba area of Mumbai. We got dropped off at The Gate of India. It was built for King George and Queen Mary. It was such a busy area, with so any sights to see, we decided to get a guide and taxi to take us round.
The next stop was the Dhobi Ghat, Washing Laundry, the biggest open laundry in Asia. I have to say, a real eye opener! So much laundry in one place is pretty amazing! My thought were, how on earth of they know what belongs to who? We continued on to what is known as the Queens Necklace, otherwise known as Marine Drive. The sea was really choppy today! But it is a great viewpoint.
We were both keen to visit the Walkeshwar Jain Temple. It was do pretty, and colourful; inside is full of silver. In dedicated to Lord Adishwar. It

was very calming and beautiful.
We moved on to the Hanging Gardens - Ferozeshah Mehta. I'm sure that if we had have been on our own, west have had a photo mob over Jude! But the guide moved everyone on! Lol. This area was part if a local park where families and friends socialise, exercise or generally relax. It is also the highest viewpoint and reservoir.

Then a place that was really interesting to us both; Mani Bhavan - Ghandi House, where he started his 'Quiet India Movement'. It had such am interesting story to tell. We probably spent more time on there than anywhere else. There were three floors of photos, information and various artefacts. It did feel quite special to see where, and how history unfolded.
As we moved around through different areas of the town, there was a strong Emglish influence in the architecture; Victorian Buildings, Mumbai University, the Town Hall, and the Rajabai clock tower which has a resemblance to Big Ben.
We returned to India Gateway about three hours later. We did lots of walking, shopping and haggling..... Then the rain came! I have to say, Colaba itself was a great area to visit;

flowing with many interesting tourist sites, shops, stalls, coffee shops and placed to eat. It seemed like a good time to return to Chembur, but that was easier said than done. The traffic in Mumbai gets crazy after 6pm. Getting a taxi was a hard task, but we got there in the end!
We arrived back at the hotel... Very wet! We showered and changed before going out for our evening jaunt! A pleasant day, followed by a pleasant evening!

Trinh getting ready for her Bollywood debut.
Things I Did In Mumbai



(Please scroll down to see all the photos)




Go see a Bollywood movie: Check

Smoke out with The Baba: Check

Star in a Bollywood Movie: Check



It was nice seeing you Mumbai, but now I'm moving on. Or maybe a little more explanation is in order, here it goes.



1) Go See a Bollywood Movie

So I'm hanging out in Mumbai with 2 girls, Belgium and Dutch on a Saturday and they are looking to shop a bit so then we stop in an upscale restaurant to eat. They have an expansive menu, American food, Chinese food, Indian food, Lebanese food, and one other kind I can't recall right now. Trinh, the Dutch girl brings up a fact from Kitchen Nightmares that a place that has everything probably can't do anything good. I decide on something from the Lebanese side since it is only available 2 days a week and that day is one of them.



The restaurant is upscale and very nice. The best part is the whole restaurant is air conditioned. Some restaurants may have an air
Trinh getting ready for her Bollywood debut.
conditioned section while the rest of the restaurant has just fans. You kinda out of place sitting in the A/C section not to mention that the A/C is off when no one is sitting in there so it is actually hotter since it is an enclosed area and probably won't cool off until the end of your meal anyway.



This restaurant is very western with nice tables and chairs, bar stools and bar spread among 2 levels. And to top it off there are a bunch of big screen TVs playing a bunch of 70's, 80's, and 90's music videos. Like the Eagles ""Hotel California"", Guns & Roses, Tom Petty, Bryan Adams, Nirvana, etc.



To make this restaurant even better someone points out to me that they have hamburgers. I took a glance at the American page on the menu but figured don't get your hopes up it is just someones idea of what an American menu is. So I take another look and hello, they actually have beef hamburgers along with a veggie burger. There is no cheese option, it just comes with English mustard, lettuce, and tomato.



Of course
Trinh & Thali out for drinks.
after I order it the waiter comes back to the table to make sure I wanted a beef hamburger and to make sure I know this one has meat. It was also interesting to note that they had a POS system in place. That is a Point of Sales, or computer system that the waiter inputs the order and it goes directly to the kitchen to the cooks.



All of the food was surprisingly good. Someone ordered the healthy chicken which turned out to be a chicken breast covered in a gravy. Tasty, yes, but healthy? I'm not so sure. As for the hamburger, well it was a regular bun with a little bit of meat in it, but it was beef so I was happy.



Walking back outside into the heat, humidity, noise, and dirtiness that is Mumbai, we had found an oasis within the city.



Later that day we decided to go see a Bollywood movie. The best part about that choice was it was air conditioned. Inside the theater there are stands that sell ice cream, cupcakes, chocolates, ice cream bars, nachos (with some weird cheese in a
On the way to the temple
cup), and popcorn. Note to Americans, Europeans seem to prefer sugar with their popcorn over salted buttered popcorn, go figure. I opted for some seasoned buttered corn in a cup.



Then there was the movie. I suggested seeing the movie ""It's Entertainment."" I had seen the posters all over Mumbai showing a guy with a dog, but the dog is sitting in a chair and the guy on the ground, or they were both holding the same bone in their mouth side by side. Anyways all the posters and billboards were in English, which was key to me. And all other Bollywood movies seem to be some sort of rom-com. And the only thing worst than a rom-com is a rom-com with singing and dancing, the key to any Bollywood film.



Now if you only see one Bollywood movie this year...



Well I wouldn't recommenced ""It's Entertainment"" necessarily. The movie starts and it is in Hindi. Now you can kind of follow along just by watching but you miss the jokes and nuances of the film. So I completely lost interest. The basic premise of the film is this guy inherits
Inside the temple
a dog and estate but they go together so he can't get rid of the dog, or something like that. Now maybe the movie is dubbed in English in some showings, but clearly all of the billboards and posters I saw were in English.



I use the time in the cool confines of the A/C theater to take a nap, as does Trinh leaving Thali the only one of us watching. I occasionally wake up when people are laughing or just because. I see singing & dancing and a lot of ball kicking and I don't mean a soccer ball. For some reason trauma to a man's testicles seems like high comedy, especially in this movie. Hell even the dog got in on the act kicking his new owner a few times.



It also turns out that every Bollywood film is a rom-com as this guy was try to win over some girl as well. In addition to all the singing & dancing and rom-com aspects as well another trait all Bollywood film posses is the guy does get the girl, but with one caveat: He never gets to kiss her. Yes a kiss
Monkeys around the temple
is considered taboo in India society. I remember a few years back Richard Gere caused quite a ruckus when promoting a film in India he kissed his co-star at some press event. Truly an international incident whose repercussions are still being felt to this day.



Anyways the movie cuts off and I awake to see ""Intermission"" up on the screen. After an hour and a half there is an intermission?? Some people go to the restrooms (this theater did have one of the nicest restrooms I have seen to date in India), or to get refreshments. Better still, an usher comes up to your seat to take your order. After 25 minutes the movie starts again and I commence to napping again. After an hour Thali wakes those of us who are sleeping and says ""let's go."" After over 3 hours the movie didn't seem to be winding down so we leave. As far as I know that movie is still playing after its 27th intermission.



2) Smoke Out With The Baba

On Mondays there is a tour to a temple north of Mumbai arranged by the owner of the Anjali Homestay hostel,
Monkeys around the temple
Raj. Raj is very helpful. He will arrange tours in Mumbai, give you recommendations on where to go in India, change money for you, help book train or bus tickets to your next destination, and much more. He does all this at no charge to you, but just to help. There a very few, maybe 4, hostels in Mumbai and Anjali is the top rated. It is also rates very high of any hostel on Hostelworld.com and that is due in large part to Raj and his staff, mainly Rajesh. Pretty much the only complaint I have heard is the location. It is very near the airport which is great, as most people start and/or end their trip in Mumbai. However it is not in the tourist area. It is only about a 40 minute auto rickshaw and train ride to the tourist area. Backpackers are a strange bunch. Some live with the Lonely Planet as their bible. They only go to restaurants and hotels mentioned in the book. They don't realize that it is only a guide, and should not be used to plan your entire trip. The same people also complain about the tourist trail and want to
The Baba
get off of it but don't realize that means sacrificing comfort and can be boring since the tourist go to areas that are made to be entertaining to them. But it does seem as time goes on that fewer people are relying solely on the Lonely Planet for their trip.



Hotels are cheap to come by in Mumbai which is why there aren't many hostels. The last time I was in Mumbai I stayed in a hotel. It wasn't until I returned home that I realized that since I was traveling solo I didn't meet anyone along the way to travel with or at least talk to about where to go and tell them what I had done and it was a totally different experience. This time I picked a hostel so I could interact with more people and it has paid off.



So on Mondays a taxi comes to the hostel at 7AM to take you to the temple. It is about an hour and a half ride each way and cost 1000IR (Indian Rupees). Raj recommends getting 4 people to go so it only costs 250IR each (about $4 @ 61 IR
Hmm, this appears to be some sort of all natural herb.
to the dollar). We actually had 5 people squeeze into the cab and away we went.



Once we arrive we meet up with Raj. He takes us to a hut where someone greets us, blesses us and puts an orange dot on the center of your forehead. Or at least that's what he did to everyone else. To me he painted my whole forehead with the orange paint. Everyone in my group was like what the... I suggested that being the only American among the group I had to atone for the bad perceived by others that America was responsible for. Only later did I find out from Raj it was to actually signify that I was a holy man. Me of all people, go figure. We then had tea and set off for the hike up the mountain to the temple.



Hiking up the trail it was rocky and muddy since it was monsoon season. Trying not to slip and fall was a job unto its self. Then you cross a stream with mid shin high water. More hiking in the mud and rocks till you get to a stream that is knee

high. Then we get in a couple of auto rickshaws to ride the rest of the way up. Auto rickshaws aren't really made for 4 wheeling, probably because they only have 3 wheels. It seems very unstable and I am just hoping we don't flip over. We do make it to the top in one piece.



Once at the temple we observe the service which last about 20 minutes. Raj then gives us a tour of the temple, then further up the mountain to another temple, then over to yet another temple. At the side of this temple they offer us a place to sit and then give us all a glass of buttermilk and some kind of fried dough along with fried chilies. Everyone takes a sip of the buttermilk and doesn't like it. What can I say buttermilk is buttermilk. I know of no one who drinks it nowadays but I do remember my mother's aunts and my grandmother drinking it when we used to visit them. I tell the group that while buttermilk isn't that great as a drink, it is great for cooking and try to explain to them buttermilk biscuits with county

gravy, or buttermilk pancakes with warm maple syrup, etc, but they never had it so they didn't seem to believe me. I fear that when any of them visit the U.S. and they are offered buttermilk biscuits or buttermilk pancakes they will unfortunately turn it down.



The fried dough was OK, however if you take a bite of the chili and then the fried dough it was good. Apart from me, this group consisting of 2 Aussies and 2 Europeans, don't eat spicy food. I also manage to drink my full glass of buttermilk. I don't want to waste anything and being a cook, want to try as many new things as possible.



I also want to venture a guess that with this mention of buttermilk, I set the record on mytb.org of posts with the most mentions of buttermilk, ever. I could be wrong, but let's assume I am right about this being the most anyone has blogged about buttermilk not on a cooking blog. See I did it again, another reference to buttermilk. This record of ""buttermilk"" references will stand for years! Now back to the story.



Raj then

leads us to another hut where he shows us the remains of the last Baba are kept. He explains that The Baba is like the Pope, and the last one died 2 years ago at the ago of 108. We then walk to another hut behind this one to meet the current Baba.



The Baba has dreadlocks. All (or most?) Babas have dreadlocks. So now it becomes more clear why I have my forehead painted instead of just a dot. There is The Baba, or the head one, then there are other Babas which are like Cardinals. So we take seats to the left of The Baba as his guests. Raj knows him personally. Other people of his faith sit in front of him. The Baba has one of his assistants make tea and offers us tea. Now when The Baba offers you tea and you are a guest in him home, you take the tea, even if just out of respect for him. Then The Baba offers us a sandwich which is basically bread, butter, and sugar. When The Baba offers you a sandwich, you take the sandwich. See where I am heading??


A Ceremony.
It appears as if some religious ceremony is taking place.

Then The Baba pulls out some Ganja. He hands it to us to inspect it. I'm no expert, far from it, so I'm like OK and had it to the next person to take a look. Then the assistant to The Baba lights the pipe for him and The Baba smokes. The Baba then offers us the pipe. Now who am I to refuse The Baba? That would be rude of me right?? I drank his tea, ate his food, and now I am to refuse his hospitality? We could have an international crisis on our hands with worldwide ramifications if I were to offend The Baba. So with that in mind I took the pipe. It had been explained before that since this was The Baba, and it is part of his religion this was totally legal.



It was also explained to us how to smoke from the pipe. There is a paper filter on the end of the pipe, but your lips are never to touch the pipe. You hold it between your thumb and forefinger and your lips touch only your hand. So out of the 5 of us in the group, 4 of
Pass the peace pipe
us did it. On the second time around only 2 or 3 of us did it. The 3rd time around it turns out I was the only one who did it. So now that the riffraff is no longer participating The Baba brings out the good stuff. I could feel a little buzz going from the previous hits I had, but when I took a hit from this new stuff, WOW! A couple more hits and I'm feeling good.



After we left The Baba we went to go see another Baba,who is like some kind of Cardinal. He also gave us tea. And I think partly because of my dreads, and partly because I was American I get the seat of honor right next to this Baba. So when he brings out the peace pipe even though I am already baked, I have to take a hit, just to be sure I don't offend him, you understand, right? No one else takes a hit and I also refuse any further hits.



Now a word (or 2) about drug use. Those that know me know I don't smoke, drink, or do drugs. However I am
Someone participating in a religious ceremony
in favor of legalizing marijuana outright, and not just for medical use. I do see where it will bring on its own problems and as a society we will have to learn to deal with it. But I do see using a little herb as not as dangerous as drinking alcohol. You don't smoke herb and want to fight or become belligerent like some people do with alcohol. Some people may become paranoid, but most of the time it makes you mellow. Hey I say let's get the Palestinians and Israelis in a room with some edibles and some good ganja and then let them hash out a peace agreement.



Before June of this year I had only been high once, in May of 2006 at a coffee shop in Amsterdam. It was a good experience but not one I repeated even a year later when I was once again in Amsterdam (I returned to photograph the tulips outside of Amsterdam). Everyone thinks that because of the dreads I must be big into smoking weed. I can now count on one hand the number of times I have been high. I am a mellow person by nature
The alter of The Baba
so I don't really need something to mellow me out. The main reason I never smoked was because of my job. As a cook I could always cut or burn myself at work badly enough to have to go to the clinic and then I could be subject to a drug test. THC can stay in your system for 30 days so I always felt that it would be my luck that I would cut myself 2 or 3 weeks after smoking something and even though I wan't under the influence of it I would be fired just for it showing up in my system. So to me it just wasn't worth the risk. After I quit my job I decided to give it a try. Smoking not that good for me, but the edibles that may be my thing. Of course the joke to the friend that I did it with was why do you need to give me something that will make you hungry and sleepy?? I have no problems with that already.



So while I am not actively seeking to get high, if the stars aligned just right and it was the right time
Inside the temple of The Baba.
Only The Baba and his personnel guest smoked.
and place and person, I may do it again, I won't rule it out. But it isn't really my thing.



Anyways back to the story at hand, I am now worried about how the hell I'm going to get off this mountain. I've got to negotiate my way down while I'm high through 2 streams and down rocks and mud and I don't have my waterproof case for my iPhone. I could just see disaster coming. But I successfully made my way down the mountain. At the end of the now almost 2 hour drive back due to traffic I was no longer feeling the effects. BTW the 1000 IR we were supposed to pay? We had to pay an extra 200 IR since we had an extra person.



P.S. Turns out there are almost a thousand different Hindu sects. Kinda like Christians are made up of Catholics, Baptists, Lutherans, Episcopalians, Methodist, etc. So The Baba we met was head of just one sect.



P.P.S. With all due respect to The Baba, and all other Babas, while they had dreadlocks theirs were in no way as luxurious and long as mine.

For the record.



3) Star in a Bollywood Movie

Since Raj owns a hostel in Mumbai full of tourist Bollywood comes a knocking sometimes looking for extras for their films. Hollywood makes about 200 commercial releases a year while Bollywood is said to make 900-1200. FYI



A really cool Aussie (but aren't all Aussies cool and great to be around? I haven't met a bad one yet. If you are ever around backpackers and a group is having a lot of fun their probably Aussies), named Jaden got a chance to be an extra. Raj said he told them he had an American with dreadlocks but they took a pass.



Jaden's shoot was supposed to be from 8AM to 8PM but he ended back by 5PM. He said the food was good, otherwise it was kinda boring which I expected, but he did get to be in a scene with the star of the movie which takes place on a cruise ship. He is walking down a hall talking to 2 other guys when the star walks past. The star of the movie is Anil Kapoor, known for being the
Another Baba. He is the equivalent of a Cardinal to the Pope
host of the game show in ""Slumdog Millionaire."" I forget the name of the movie but it is to come out in July 2015.



Anyways Trinh, the Dutch girl got approached by a guy to be an extra in a Bollywood film. The shoot is supposed to be from 7PM to 5AM. She shows the card to Raj who has never heard of the production company. He wants to know if they are allowing any guys along or do they just want girls, a sure sign it is not on the up and up. Raj calls up the guy and gets info from him and verifies with other contacts he has in the business that this is a real production and OKs it.



Trinh is texting with the guy and tells him she has a few people who would be interested, a couple of Aussies, an English lad, and me. Basically the same group that went to the temple. The others are OK-ed but Trinh told the guy I was mixed, black and white and the guy says he can't use me if I look too ""Indian.""



Now being black in

I think the assistant is either a fan of James Brown...
America I have experienced minor and subtle forms of racism, very minor compared to what others have been subject to in the past. But here I am literally halfway around the world and I still have to put up with it, I mean, really??



India, like most countries has a race problem. Darker skinned people are discriminated against. It happens everywhere. In Colombia, Mexico, etc, you see the blonde haired, blue eyed people on TV and in the movies and hardly any dark skinned people. Even in my beloved Brazil it happens. Brazil, like America has every color of the spectrum. From the most fair skinned blondes to the darkest people of African ancestry. But Brazil has the best mix of people in between. And in Brazil it isn't considered a race problem, it is defined as a class problem. But make no mistake about it, the fairer skins make up most of the upper class, while the darker skinned people represent the majority of the lower class.



India has a caste (class) system and race problem. A lot of women use skin creams with bleaching agents in them to make their skin lighter.

or the Reverend Al Sharpton.
Last year the woman who won Miss America, Nina Davuluri, was of Indian descent, her parents immigrated from India and she was born in the U.S. but she was the second to win of Asian descent. The reaction in India was not ""Hey look at her, she won Miss America,"" but ""How could she have won? She isn't pretty, she is too dark."" I mean she just won the title of Miss America, a beauty pageant. Of course there was a backlash in America over her winning as well.



See how I can go off on a tangent? Focus Dave, focus.



Anyways, to make a long story short (too late huh), Trinh sends the guy a photo of me and I make the cut.



They are sending a bus to pick us up at 5 but we end up getting picked up about 7. The filming takes place at an old closed county club. When we arrive I see 3 mobile homes which I take to be the stars trailers. I am right as one of them is labeled ""Director.""



Now I have never actually worked on a
Pass the peace pipe.
Hollywood set, but I have been around a few living in Vegas. You come across film crews and TV crews all the time shooting in Vegas. I know people who work on production crews. As a matter of fact I had a brush with a movie being filmed when I got out of the military and returned to Vegas. The movie ""Showgirls"" was in pre-production. It was supposed to be a big movie since it was written by Joe Eszterhas who wrote ""Basic Instinct"" and directed by Paul Verhoeven who directed ""Robocop"" and ""Basic Instinct."" It was about a girl who comes to Vegas and ends up a star in a Vegas show. The Vegas show in the movie, titled ""Goddess"" was supposed to become an actual Broadway show. My interest in ""Showgirls"" besides it being about Las Vegas and parts of it being filmed in the showroom at the casino where I worked was Esterhouse and Verhooven wanted Prince to do the entire soundtrack. But Prince was in a fight with his record label at the time, Warner Brothers, and they wouldn't let him do it so he ended up only having 2 songs in the film, ""319"" and
Finally back down the mountain
""Ripopgodazippa."" Maybe it worked out for the best for Prince since it tanked at the box office and his name wasn't attached to it. ""Showgirls"" is now considered a cult classic and one of the ""best"" worst movies. They even have midnight showings sometimes. Robert Davi has some of the best lines in the film, but the lines are NSFW.



And now back to our story. The ballroom of the country club is set up as a casino so I'm feeling at home. Men and women are separated and we are ushered to wardrobe. Some guys are told you are a dealer, some are asked if they know how to deal cards. I'm from Vegas so I know how to deal cards. I'm no expert but I know I'm better than some of these guys who have never set foot in a casino. As the numbers dwindle I sense a pattern. On our bus was were 5 Koreans, and 8 Nigerians 2 of which are girls, along with a number of Europeans. none of the Nigerians have been assigned anything and only 2 Koreans have. Most of the Europeans have been chosen for roles. Finally one Nigerian

is selected as a dealer. Everyone else left is told to go get something to eat and return later.



I go eat and it is nothing remarkable. I had a couple of boiled eggs and a samosa. The food was supposed to be one of the highlights of being an extra, but oh well. We return to wardrobe and are told to pick out suits to wear. I can't find a shirt that fits me, I run into this problem sometimes because I have broad shoulders. Same problem I have whenever I get fitted for a tuxedo or suit, whenever I get a jacket that fits I have to have the sleeves shortened. I am told to just wear the shirt I have since it is a button up with a collar. Now to find a sports coat that fits. Surprisingly I do find one and shoes, so it is off to the set.



Now those that know me know that I hate to have my photo taken. The only thing worse than having my photo taken is having a video taken, so maybe I didn't think this thing all the way through. Still
Inside an auto rickshaw
I just wanted to see how the sausage is made, so to speak. My job now is to really stay in the background, out of sight.



I manage to get a seat at a dinner table on the casino floor. It's a deuce, which in restaurant terms means it is a 2 top, or 2 seater. I chose that for two reasons, 1) it was a chair, and 2) it was situated near an A/C tubing vent. This country club is no longer open so there is no electricity or running water. In the bathrooms there are two 55 gallon drums of water to wash your hands with, an improvement over most restrooms I have been to in India. For us guys at least we have 2 banks of urinals to use in addition to a few stalls. Remember there is no running water so I can only imagine the situation over in the ladies room, not being able to flush.



No electricity means that outside of the county club there are a few generators and A/C units running to supply power and cool air so there is a ton of wiring and 2
A selfie with Trinh
feet circumference tubing all around and you have to take care not to trip over it. Actually it isn't 2 feet in circumference because they use the metric system so whatever the equivalent of that is. And you can't trip over it because here there are no shyster lawyers to call to get you a bucket of money, you'll just get laughed at.



So I have a seat at a table which is a good thing since It. Takes. Forever. To. Shoot. These. Scenes.



The group that I came with are active in the background, walking through, etc. Alex, an English guy who I think I finally convinced that soccer really does suck (I'm on a mission), was in the background of every scene. However Andrew, an Aussie, was chosen to be a dealer. Not just any dealer but the roulette dealer. The stars of the movie come into the casino and then the leading man plays a few hands of roulette dealt by Andrew. This is supposed to be a key scene in the movie so Andrew will for sure make the cut in the movie. Not sure how much, it may just

I had to show them how to deal cards.
be his hands, but he will be in it. Spoiler Alert! The leading man makes a bet of $50,000 and wins, then a bet of $100,000 and wins, then a bet of $250,000 and loses. At one point the leading lady shrieks, I'm not sure if it is when he wins the money or loses the money.



Now I'm sitting at a table and there are maybe 6-7 tables with anywhere from 2-8 seats per tale. Also at the table is a glass of wine and a glass of, oh I don't know vodka, maybe a gin & tonic?? We are told not to drink it and at first I think to let us know that it isn't real. But as it turns out they later pick up the glasses to use at the blackjack tables and at the bar before bringing them back to the dinner tables.



There is a group of Eastern European girls who are ""dancers"" in Mumbai. Now I have photographed professional dancers like ballet dancers, Radio City Rockettes, Las Vegas Showgirls and they have a certain grace about them that these girls didn't have. I have also photographed strippers
On the Bollywood set of Bang Bang!
Where I sat for 4 hours .
and I don't think there are strip clubs in India, so maybe there girls fall somewhere in between?



Anyways these Eastern Euro girls keep to themselves talking in their language then they start rearranging the chairs so they can all sit together. Finally someone from the crew tells them to put the chairs back at the table and to sit at the tables. One of the girls is told to sit at my table and for the next 3 1/2- 4 hours not 2 words are said between us. Mind you she was talking to her friends, just not to me. But that is how the Eastern Euros roll, they keep to themselves.



They have couples starting at certain points walking every 2-5 seconds in the background of the scenes. Trinh and Alex pair up to walk through some of the scenes. They have a game where they say outlandish stuff to each other while walking through the scenes. But they can't react to it because they are on camera. I think I could come up with some good stuff, but hearing some of the stuff that was said I may have had a
On the Bollywood set of Bang Bang!
hard time maintaining my composure.



We break for lunch, or whatever you call a meal @ 2AM. Actually after working the graveyard shift for 15 years we do call it lunch. In the military it was called mid-rats, or midnight rations. The food is nothing to write home about (but if you have a blog maybe it is worth mentioning??), the one thing I remember is some pasta with Alfredo sauce,but not very good sauce. There are actually 2 lines to get food, one for the extras and one for the crew. The crew had Indian food and some of the Eastern Euro girls try to get in that line but are shooed away.



We return to the set and I am sitting at my table when at one point they run out of guys to walk through so someone from the crew tell me to walk with this girl. Now I'm sitting there just chillin' and I have my shoes off. I'm scrambling trying to get my shoes on but don't make it in time.



I finally get corralled into walking through a scene, and we do about 5-6 takes.
On the Bollywood set of Bang Bang!
After I finish I find some other place to hang out to avoid doing anything again. Someone comes up to the group and says we are needed to walk though over there. I get up with the rest of the group but then I make a break for it and move to another corner with a different group. About 10 minutes later, apparently the same person comes up to this group I am now with and tells us we are needed somewhere and to move over there. Then they look at me and say, ""Hey didn't I just tell you to move over with that other group?"" Oh really? I didn't understand.



Now at this time we are only supposed to have less than 2 hours left to shoot. And I'm thinking at this point if you haven't used me, why should I start now? But somehow, someone decided that they have to use the guy with the dreadlocks, I'm in demand. So I do a few takes walking through a scene. Then I'm sitting on the grand staircase waiting when the leading lady walks down the stairs to the set. She is very pretty, but hey
On the Bollywood set of Bang Bang!
Trinh, leading the glamorous life, in costume on the set of Bang Bang!
I guess that is part of why you get to be a leading lady. I am asked to take a seat on a chaise lounge at the bar, with 3 other girls. Then the leading man and lady walk up and they each have their own mirror being held by someone and they are checking their hair and make up, and the next thing you know I am in a scene with the leading actors. I am only about 4 feet away but I can't really hear what they are saying. I guess that is what the boom mics are for. But I do make out that they are speaking Hindi, or just definitely not English. We do only 2-3 takes and we are asked to step back while they shoot from different angles.



I end up sitting right next to the director and his monitor. The director has headphones on so he can hear what is being said, but I still can't hear and I am only 6 feet away. I can see in the monitor that this is a close up shot of the leads. I then look at the actors and Hrithik Roshan, who

After 6 1/2 hours of shooting.
is the leading man had either a room key card or credit card in his hand and I notice something about him. Trinh is sitting 2 seats over and I am trying to get her attention to look without drawing attention to what I am talking about. She doesn't notice it but Hrithik Roshan has two thumbs on his right hand. I imagine it would be akin to being on the set of Top Gun and saying out loud ""Hey look at Tom Cruise, he is only 5 feet tall."" It would probably get you immediately escorted off the set so I have to wait to tell her. Now I had seen people take or try to take photos on the set. Especially if you were caught taking photos of the leading actors your camera was taken, you were kicked off the set, or both. I had managed to take a few photos on set. The few times I had a line of sight of the leading actor is was always from behind and far away so there was no chance to take an inconspicuous photos without raising my camera up. Now I am sitting in the best place to

take an on set photograph, and it would have made for a great photos. Seeing the director looking at his monitor wearing his headphones with the leads in the background, and then a photograph of the leads with the director and his monitor in the foreground. Unfortunately there was just no way to pull it off. I especially wanted to get a shot of Hrithik Roshan's hand. I have been in India not even 2 weeks and this was the 4th person that I noticed with 2 thumbs on one hand. India has almost 4 times the population of the U.S. but I have never seen it in the States. Is this a numbers thing??



Well we were supposed to be done shooting at 5AM but that came and went and we were still shooting. They started telling people to go change into their street clothes, and when I was headed to wardrobe I was told to wait I was to be in another scene. Andrew who was the roulette dealer, was told he could change but after he changed into his own clothes someone said they wanted close up shots of him so to get back

into costume. I guess he was tired because he was not too happy. After he got back into his dealer uniform he sat around waiting to shoot some more but it was all for nothing, they didn't shoot any more with him. We finally finished up at about 7:30AM.



So the name of the film we shot was ""BANG BANG!"" Starring Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif. It is a remake of ""Knight and Day"" starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. I guess we shot some of the last scenes because it is scheduled to be released on October 2nd. And the trailer is already out.















The first teaser of the film was released on July 23rd 2014 and became the most watched teaser/trailer (in the first 24 hours) of Bollywood. The trailer got 2.33 million views in 24 hours - a new record.



So for almost 12 hours of time starring in a Bollywood Blockbuster = Priceless.



Actual pay for being an extra on a Bollywood Film =

Andrew and Melissa. Andrew will probably be in the film, or at least his hands will. He was the roulette dealer and he even had lines to read.
500 Indian Rupees (or $8.19 at the time of the exchange rate). Incidentally Andrew, who was the roulette dealer got paid the same as the rest of the group. And he even had lines. I'm not even sure if they got his name to give him a credit in the film.



Well that was some of the highlights of 2 weeks in Mumbai. A city of heat, humidity, and almost 24 million people. And the rain in the first 8-10 days. Now I'm off to the state of Rajasthan, more on that later.

I have a contact in Pune. Well, my mother has a contact in Pune. Well my mother has a friend who has a sister in Pune. Her name is Pushpa. And this Sunday Pushpa had arrange for me to have lunch with her and her family at the Phoenix Mall, one of the biggest flashest malls in Pune, so big and flash you could forget you were in Pune, and perhaps that was its attraction, as no one seemed to do any buying there, just lots of walking around imbibing the alternate reality of malldom.



Kiran was Pushpa’s daughter and she and her friend Shinie had come to pick me up to meet her parents at the mall. We made pleasant chit chat in the car but once out of her brick red Ford Ecosport I became the property and obligation of her mother.

Pushpa had imagined I could be Kiran’s new BFF but Kiran knew that any friend introduced by her mother was like a poisoned chalice and to drink would mean to take that one sip too many; making the potion of motherly love into poison. As we rode the escalator to the food court

Pushpa happily chatted about how Kiran and I must synchronise our spare moments. She described in detail the wonderful times we’d have shopping whilst laughing, and laughing whilst exploring the wonders of Pune. Like any kind of blind date or arranged marriage – it doesn’t matter how charming the parties of the two parties are – the mystery of chemistry cannot be tricked nor cajoled into flashing that smile that can only be ignited by love’s flinty glint.

So alas, Kiran only eyed me with pity and contempt as she gazed over her Samsung S5 – and I, like some unlucky angler kept casting my gaze her way to draw her to conversation that that was flowing much more freely between me and her friend Shinie, who turned to ask;

“And what will you have Pi Wei?”

“Hmmm the vegetarian thali looks good.”

Silence. Not just silence but a stillness descended on the table; the table tableaued. Nothing could be heard except for the slicing ffft of psychic arrows of pity and contempt shooting across the stillness just missing me and hitting a couple of waiters in the distance.

“She’s vegetarian……. Yoga.”

Shinie piped

in with her movie star smile.

“I’m not a very good vegetarian. I still eat my mother’s cooking.”

“I’m vegetarian too…….Diabetic.”

Said Pushpa in solidarity.

“We are a hundred percent non-vegetarian”

Said Mr Pushpa for the rest of the table.

THE place
Baby, look at me and tell me what do you see? You ain't seen the best of me yet Give me time, I'll make you forget the rest I've got more in me, and you can set it free I can catch the moon in my hand Don't you know who I am? Remember my name
I’m here to “do yoga” – to study at the RIMYI for 4 weeks. I’ve been training to be an Iyengar yoga teacher since 2012 and with any luck will be certified this October when I sit for the certifying assessment in Sydney. The first time Studying at the Institute is a bit of a rite of passage for any Iyengar yoga teacher – the moment when a young teacher gets blooded – becomes initiated into the bolsterhood – is inoculated with the Indian culture – drinks form the ancient rubber chalice of asana and gets a good telling off from the grand wazoo.

I went with Lynn, whose apartment I’m staying in, to visit the institute even though I don’t have any classes until Saturday. I’ve actually been to the institute before in 2008 for the 90th birthday celebrations of Iyengar but never as a student. So here I am - at the Juilliard School of yoga. I remember getting this same feeling when I first entered in the Victorian College of the Arts as a young director or at L’Ecole Lecoq as an actor….in fact Lecoq had a presence much like Iyengar. People were kind of in awe
a statue on arrive of Ramamani Iyengar
and a nice tomato plant growing there too
and afraid of him at the same time. So here I am ….. again.

As I stood in the courtyard, I could hear Brahman priests chanting mantras for him to get well soon. Well I’m guessing that....or maybe they were singing

(Fame) I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly (High)
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry
(Fame) I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
(Fame) I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my name
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)



It’s monsoon season and apparently the wettest in 10 years and yet it doesn't seem as wet as Robertson where I come from. The rain comes in big fat drops here then stops then starts then stops. Not like in Robertson where is just “is”. A rainy day in Robertson is a rainy day ALL day; and a rainy week is ALL week as if it stopped for even a short while it may not be able to legitimately claim to reign. I always imagined monsoon as being more ALL encompassing
Work life balance
The Iyengars live the building on the left and work in the building on the right. Just roll out of bed and into the studio...not saying that's what they do but it's what I'd do.
than this but perhaps I’m speaking too soon - monsoon? Either way it’s warm tropical rain which is fine by me.

You know, an interesting thing happens when you try to be a better person? – ie better than the schmuck you are right now reading this blog and me writing it. Number one; you fail. Well you were already failing before but you just didn't know it. And now you know you are a schmuck that has failed to be anything other than a schmuck.

I used to think I was awesome at yoga before I started this yoga teacher training thing – now I know I kinda suck and that’s an improvement on the way I was practicing before. So here I am the Schmuck that sucks; the meat eating vegetarian; the hot headed yogi, the sweet as pie relationship killer, the greeenie that owns a Purple Prada dress, the idiot savant on a good day anyway and irreverent seeker.

Breakfast at the Golden Swan
As I sit in the bus from Mumbai to Pune - I feel like I’ve been in a comedy of errors up until now.

After not hearing squat from the Unicontinental, I booked with the Golden Swan from booking.com (great site BTW). They were going to pick me up from the airport so when I saw a nice man holding a piece of paper with my name on it at the airport I naturally thought it was the Golden Swan. On arrival at the hotel I realised that the Unicontinental had somehow been listening even though they had not been responding to my emails…….

This is the moment where Pi Wei loses her shit after 20 hours of travel and what now seemingly amounts to abduction, as they hold me captive in their lobby insisting that I pay for their airport transfer and overnight stay whether I stay or not – so I might as well stay right? BOOM!

That night as I stood in my room at the Golden Swan I turned to see Kim Jong Il looking back at me – or was that his son – or Margaret Cho in drag? I was tired yet
The sweet truth
enervated from my lobby performance at the Unicontinental. Like a vaudeville player I wiped away the characters of the nights’ performance and needed the gin and an after show party to help me forget them.



I lay down in the grubby sheets of my $40 hotel and slept.

London Heathrow Airport, Plane Landing @ Sunset #1
London Heathrow Airport, Plane Landing @ Sunset #1
So here I am sitting in Mumbai. This trip takes me to Asia, starting off in India. How long will it last? Where am I going? I have no precise date to return. I couldn't get the time off I wanted for this trip so I had to think about it for a second and I quit my job. I had saved up for this trip and planned it for almost 2 years (well don't let me lie to you, there was no planning), so when I didn't get the time off I needed I resigned. I have nothing tying me down so I figured I might as well go for it because who knows what could happen if I wait. Now with no date I have to be back I will try to travel for 2 years. Really I am only limited by my funds, so in addition to volunteering I will see if I can pick up an odd job here and there.



I was in India and Nepal 5 years ago. They say that India is a place that you love or hate. I was kinda indifferent to it. So I know I had to
London Heathrow Airport, Plane Landing @ Sunset #2
London Heathrow Airport, Plane Landing @ Sunset #2
give it another shot, whereas I loved Nepal.



One thing about India is you will get sick. When I travel I always eat the local cuisine, especially the street food. I have an iron stomach and never had problems until I came to India. I work in a kitchen and know Health Department standards and sometimes cringe whenever I see food being prepared. Basic stuff like hand washing, or lack thereof, no hot water used to wash dishes, food being left out in the open, no proper refrigeration. But I realize that locals eat with no problems, so when in Rome...



In 2009 I had a month’s vacation I spent in India & Nepal. I got a case of ""Delhi Belly"" twice within 10 days of arriving in India. After that I guess my stomach adjusted and everything was OK. Of course I think it helped that I spent the last 2 1/2 weeks eating vegetarian. In all my travels since I have had no problems. Now back in India and I get sick 3 times in a week and a half. The first 4 days no problems, then it hits. I eventually rode
London Heathrow Airport, Plane Landing @ Sunset #3
London Heathrow Airport, Plane Landing @ Sunset #3
it out but at one point I only drank water for almost 2 days and couldn't figure out how I had anything left inside of me to churn out.



I did say to myself that once I got sick I would switch to a veg diet. When you go to a restaurant in India they ask if you want a veg or non veg menu. However I can tell you I didn't go completely veg in one word: tandoori chicken. OK that's two words but you get my point. I won't go completely vegetarian, but I will cut back on meat.



Hmm, looking back at that last paragraph I probably need to clarify something. For those who don't know there is no beef or pork in India. The cow is sacred in the Hindu religion, which makes up the biggest percentage of the Indian population. The Muslims make up the 2nd biggest religion, and they don't eat pork. I believe that most, if not all Hindus are vegetarian so they just don't eat meat and Muslims don't eat beef out of respect for the Hindus. I could be wrong about that but the bottom
Mutton with butter Roti
line is there is no bacon or steaks in India! Of course in Mumbai, Goa, or other major tourist destinations you may find the odd high end restaurant that serves it, but really you can't get it. So by giving up meat in India I would just be giving up chicken and mutton. Someone also told me that mutton in India could be lamb or could be goat, you're never really sure.



One frustrating thing is seeing signs for ""burgers"" outside a restaurant. By ""burger"" they mean veggie burger or chicken burger, not really burgers at all. But the worst part is they have a picture of a hamburger out front with a 1/2 pound beef patty. In South America they trick you with the same hamburger pics, but at least you get a sliver of beef in your burger. Why have pictures of a hamburger if you don't sell hamburgers?? They do the same thing with hot dogs. A picture of a hot dog when all they sell is a bun with veggies. Oh the humanity!



India is one of the emerging nations in BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). They are
Auto Rickshaw Mumbai #1
aiming to be the new G7 or whatever it is these days. But sorry India you can't crack that top tier nation status until you start selling bacon cheeseburgers. I'm just sayin’.



This trip marks 3 big changes for me. The first was the fact that I quit my job of 21 years. I can hope that the economy improves when I return so finding a job won't be that difficult. But the reality is my resume will show 4 years in the military and 21 years working for Caesars' Entertainment and I left because I wanted to travel. That should somewhat set me apart from the rest. I could possibly walk back into my old job since I left on good terms and the chefs and people I worked with we sorry to see me go. Well that's what they told me to my face at least.



The 2nd change for me was I broke down and joined that horrible social network known as the Book of Faces. I thought I never would and regrettably did join just before I left. I realized after my last trip that is the way most people
Auto Rickshaw Mumbai #2
communicate. I would meet people in Colombia and Brazil where I spent most of my time, and people would ask me for my Facebook. I would tell them just give me your email address and I will email you. I emailed a few people I had met to let them know I would be in their city but I never heard back from them. It wasn't until near the end of my trip that I realized that most people don't have access to an internet connection so they may just visit an internet cafe a few times a week so they only check their Facebook, no one checks email. Talking with a group of fellow backpackers a couple of days ago and I heard someone say they weren't on Facebook and I shed a single tear. I remember when I used t be a member of that exclusive club.



So while I am on the Book of Faces, I don't really post anything on there just a link back to my blog. I may update where I am but don't really plan on posting photos, etc. For some reason a search of my email address doesn't seem
Yannick and Street Girl
Yannick, an Aussie, and a street girl. She didn't just ask for money though, she did temporary henna tattoos.
to work. Do you know how many David Oliver’s there are? If you put David Oliver Las Vegas I'm the 2nd one that shows up. Who is this fool David Oliver who outranks me in my own hometown?? The nerve of some people.



The 3rd big change for me is the fact that I am no longer traveling with any cameras. That's a good thing since I am down one extra backpack. Those that know me know that I am a photographer who only shoots FILM. And I was shooting mostly medium format film. So the question was how much film do I take? You never want to run out, it is always better to have too much film. And getting film overseas is impossible and in the rare cases you can find it is 2-3 times more expensive than back home. Hell the reality is I can't even get film in Vegas, I have to order it from LA.



Another thing about professional film is it is like cheese, it needs to be refrigerated, and then brought to room temp before being used. So for my South America trip I carried 4 cameras,
My Henna Tattoos
Told me it was 10 IR (Indian Rupees) for a tattoo. then she added a few more designs. Then I found out it was 10 for each stamp and she had me for 60 IR, or a dollar.
a tripod, and film. Now I was schlepping the film around in 95' weather and up to 100% humidity. Through desert, mountains, and the Amazon Rain-forest. Those are not the best conditions to keep film. When I returned home I sent out my film to be processed. That was the first time ever that I didn't process my own black and white film. Some of the film had stuck together because of the humidity and it was very low contrast. As it was the quality of the negatives weren't good so I didn't even attempt to print any photographs.



I made a book of my trip using only photos taken with my iPhone. I will upload it soon.





I now am using just my iPhone for photos and videos. I do miss shooting film but it just isn't really practical for a long trip like this. And hey, an iPhone isn't really a digital camera is it? Really it is like the new generation of Swiss Army Knife, a multipurpose tool.



Anyways this trip takes me to Asia. I have no set plans or timelines. I am now in
Veg Dinner with a Mango Lassi
India and plan on visiting a lot of Asia or Southeast Asia. Some of the countries I plan on visiting are Nepal, China, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, & Laos. Since I have more time than money I plan on traveling overland, by bus or train and maybe the odd boat or ferry. I do have at least one flight I will need to take to get to China because it is very difficult to cross from Nepal to China via Tibet. A few other countries I may visit are Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan and South Korea. Basically any country that will have me.





This is 4 the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow

Not knowing where I'm going is galaxies better

Than not having a place 2 go

Now I know (Now I know)

2014-07-28 09.42.48
About to leave to study at the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute (RIMYI) in Pune for a month.

It's a bit of an Iyengar yoga teacher's pilgrimage and rite of passage. This will be my first time to study in the institute but not my first visit there. I went there in 2008 for the 90th birthday celebrations of BKS Iyengar which was a joyous affair but I think studying at the institute will not be quite along the same lines.

Tying up my life has been pretty tricky and quite stressful. Leaving for 4 weeks means you need to make sure things (at work) don't fall apart while you are gone. No I'm not indispensable but I am responsible for making certain decisions in my business that no one else can do. In this day and age it's no problem to contact me while in in another country but who'd want that?! Not me!

OK just 48 hours before I take off and I'm kicking this off with a suitcase shot. I can't believe it's been so long since I've travel blogged.

Cafe Good Luck
You know a restaurant is successful when it is used as a landmark by anyone and everyone throughout the city. Good Luck chowk on F.C.Road is just that. It’s a prime busy crossing, deriving its name from the Irani establishment that lords over the corner.



Since 1935 is what their hoarding proudly proclaims and 75 years in the business is no mean feat. Even donkey’s years feels short of an adjective to describe the legacy of this place. From octogenarians to the now college going crowd, everyone fondly remembers at some time having had a cup of Irani tea with bun maska in its hallowed confines.



Cafe Good Luck is primarily a non-vegetarian place with the mutton biryani, mutton cutlet curry and mutton kheema being the mainstays of its eclectic menu. However, many a vegetarians like me are found enjoying the thali during lunch hour and breakfast time is when I believe the place truly offers a unique experience with the most varied egg options. From omelets, fried eggs to the most soft and fluffy scrambled eggs on toast, you’ll get them here. French toast is served either sweet, salty or both to your taste while the baked beans allow the most fitting accompaniment to the spread. Keep an eye out for that waiter though, he’s not going to make way to your table in a hurry nor is he going to greet you with a 32 teeth smile unless you are a regular and are known to tip generously.



Nostalgia pervades the surrounding with glass mirrors decorating the main hall. Antique decoration adds the quintessential touch. For that Good Luck has retained its original character. It still is at face value a true blue Irani joint. Food is cheap with no frills service.



Food pilgrimage if there is such a thing ends with the shrine of its premises where to find a solitary gentleman reading his morning paper with the customary cup of tea gives you a deep sense of satisfaction. At that moment you know, that everything is alright with the world and there’s nothing that a lazy hour spent in the gastronomic temple cannot fix.



There comes a time when you don’t just visit a restaurant for the food it offers but as part of a ritual. An arcane rite of passage that isn’t complete till you confess to having succumbed to its marble top charms. For you haven’t really experienced the culture and the soul of the city if you haven’t tried to absorb it looking out of the window, seated on its chairs wondering about the person who might have sat on the same seat as yours 50 years ago staring out of the same window as the world nonchalantly went by.



So if you are in Pune with a little time to spare, visit this place and you’ll find one piece of the puzzle that makes the city complete.

Akong
Mon compagnon d'un jour, Akong, pris en photo lors de son court passage à Bombay!
Deuxième jour en Inde :

Namasté! Il est 7h à Bombay,

Après une nuit de sommeil écourtée par la chaleur montante de l'orée matinale; je suis au petit déjeuner. Je prends des forces car aujourd'hui je vais beaucoup marcher.

J'ai rendez-vous dans 15 minutes avec Akong, un moine bouddhiste qui a fait exceptionnellement le déplacement à la ville pour m'escorter durant le voyage.

D'après ce que je sais, nous nous rendons dans un temple reculé dans lequel les habitants ont tous fait vœux de silence, pour le temps qu'ils y séjournent. Cette journée va me permettre de bien comprendre pourquoi le nudisme est autant un tabou en Inde. Akong m'avait fait transmettre une liste de règles à suivre lorsque j'entrerai dans le temple et surtout, les sujets que je ne dois surtout pas aborder. (je suis la seule femme invitée cette année, ils accueillent uniquement 10 visiteurs par an).

Je pars au point de rendez-vous, je vous écris lorsque ma journée sera terminée (évidemment qu'ils n'ont pas de connexion là-bas).



Me voilà de retour de mon périple. Je suis encore plongée dans cette ambiance de plénitude qui règne dans ce
Le Temple du OHM
Vu de l'extérieur (les photos sont interdites à l'intérieur)... dommage pour vous, moi j'ai des souvenirs pleins la tête!
genre de lieu sacré. Tout n'est que calme et volupté comme dirai Baudelaire. Outre le savoir que m'a enseigné Akong, j'ai été émerveillée par la beauté du temple et sa préservation. Les moines s'appliquent à l'entretenir de manière quotidienne et n'autorisent que très peu de visiteurs, notamment pour garder les lieux intactes. Après une visite de la ""propriété"", Akong m'a invité à nous asseoir à l'écart pour discuter de ma venue et de mon objectif. J'ai été très flattée qu'il ai auparavant, pris le temps de lire ma thèse pour mieux pouvoir me répondre. En amont de notre entretien, Akong a décidé de me donner sa définition de l'ethnographie et surtout ce qu'il entendait par naturisme (notion très peu connue ici).

Le projet que je mène avec Burdi ville l'intéresse beaucoup et il est davantage enthousiaste car il rappelle que les bouddhistes sont des pacifistes et sont donc favorables aux rassemblement de ce type, qui favorisent le lien social. Il a insisté sur cette dynamique de communauté qui entretien la vie au sein de leur temple et sur laquelle nous devrions prendre exemple plus souvent. Il m'a confié que bien des choses lui paraissaient futiles à ses yeux concernant notre mode de vie occidental et les polémiques qui n'ont pas lieu d'être. Puis il s'est ensuite plu à m'expliquer pourquoi la nudité était aussi tabou dans leur pays.

En fait, les Indiens et tout particulièrement les peuples hindous; associent la nudité au mouvement des hippies. Selon eux; les hippies se ""réduisent"" à des personnes droguées fuyant toutes types de responsabilités et de restrictions. De plus, ils seraient en totale contradiction avec les lignes de vies des bouddhistes qui défendent la consommation de drogues et autres produits détériorant le corps et l'esprit. D'autre part, les indiens identifient une personne nue comme une source de désir; or dans cette communauté la consommation du plaisir ne se fait qu'en privé et n'est donc pas approprié à l'espace public. En conséquence, le fait de se dévoiler en public s'apparenterai à une forme de provocation pour les esprits imaginatifs. La seule personnalité nue qui à l'autorisation de s'afficher dans les lieux publics, c'est la déesse Circa qu'ils vénèrent plus que tout et qui est représentée ainsi depuis la nuit des temps. Donc, à moins que vous ne soyez immortels; je vous conseille de garder vos vêtements lorsque vous venez en visite en Inde!

Akong est cependant quelqu'un de plus conciliant, qui ne se voit pas heurté si il entrevoit une personne à demi couvert (il a rigolé en me confiant cela!) mais il pense que c'est une pratique à prendre très sérieusement et à ne pas enseigner aux enfants, tout particulièrement. J'ai beau avoir insisté en lui disant que l'événement ne tendrai pas vers cette pente là mais il reste sur sa faim.

De retour en ville, j'ai retranscris tout ce que j'ai appris au cours de cette journée et ai bien sur remplit mon carnet de bord (particulièrement pour le montrer au retour à mon mari et mon fils!).

A présent je vais partir à la découverte de Bombay plus en détails avant de revenir à l'hôtel, préparer mes bagages et partir à nouveau pour l'aéroport...

Prochaine destination: Madagascar!

A plus tard.

La gare de Bombay
Petit détour à la gare de Bombay qui me rappelle tant la scène finale du film Slumdog Millionaire!
Deuxième étape: Bombay (Mumbaï en Indhi)

J'ai enfin atterri à Bombay! Sans surprise, les 11h30 passées dans l'avion ont été longues mais je n'ai pas eu d'escale donc j'ai pu dormir un peu.

L'ambiance indienne est oppressante; sans compter la chaleur qu'il fait. Il y'a 10°c de plus qu'à Barcelone donc autant vous dire que le retour en bus pour atteindre Bombay a été rude.

Ici, j'ai choisi de ne pas faire appel à un guide. J'ai travaillé durant ma thèse avec un ethnologue indien qui m'avait déjà bien renseigné sur le rapport que les indiens ont avec la nudité. Il m'avait alors fait part de cette grande pudeur que les Indiens ont en public comme dans la vie privée. Les populations indiennes non sont en effet pas autorisées à ""exhiber"" leurs corps dans les lieux publics. Les seuls endroits (d'ailleurs menacés de fermeture par les autorités) où la nudité est présente, ce sont les bars dit de bons plaisirs. La nudité, uniquement des femmes, y est acceptée mais avec des règles très strictes. Je ne suis donc pas surprise, lorsque je demande aux passants de m'indiquer un endroit où je puisse voir des corps dévoilés; que ces
Le Jardin des amours
Vous connaissez tous l'histoire du Taj Mahal, créé par un prince en offrande à sa femme? L'arche du Jardin des amour serait une réponse de la femme à son prince. Postée au porte de Bombay; elle serai tournée en direction du monument célèbre si l'on vérifie ses coordonnées géographiques!
derniers me répondent que c'est une pratique qui ne se fait pas ici.


La question qui vous vient alors à l'esprit est de vous demander, pourquoi j'ai décidé d'y faire escale? Ma réponse est curieuse mais je voulais être sure des ont dit... L'Inde est un pays qui ne tolère vraiment pas la nudité et dont le naturisme parait inconnu dans les esprits. Je voulais donc vérifier par moi-même s’il n'y avait pas un coin retranché qui défie les mœurs ou une personne qui pourrait faire ""exception à la règle"". Aucun enseignant de l'université de Bombay n'a traité cette question de la nudité et lorsque j'ai tenté de parler du projet de ""Burdi mis à nu""; un homme employait un ton menaçant en me disant que nous risquions d'avoir des scènes de violence au cours de la manifestation (de par les tenues, je cite - affriolantes- que nous voulons tous faire adopter).

Choquée par ces propos mais ne souhaitant pas faire d'histoire; j'ai décidé de quitter la fac pour une petite visite culturelle de la ville. J'ai pu aller voir la Gare, célèbre pour son apparition dans le film Slumdog Millionaire et dans laquelle, ça grouille
Avenue mohamed ali
Cliché de l'avenue mondialement connue avant de me rendre à l'hôtel qui se trouve à deux pas d'ici!
comme dans une fourmilière. Je me suis ensuite enfoncée dans la rue Mohamed Ali avant de me poser pour ""pic niquer"" dans un parc le soir. Je n'ai pas fait long feu car le Jet-lag se fait sentir. J'ai donc décidé de vite trouver mon hôtel pour m'y étaler après cette journée de chaleur accablante.

Demain, je me lève tôt, visite d'un temple bouddhiste et rencontre avec un moine qui a accepté de me parler de naturisme. J'ai hâte!

Bonne nuit!

March 19th 2014
Published: March 19th 2014


IMG_6133
Idea of visiting Raigad was being tossed up few times in last few months but nothing concrete was getting worked out.Come December which is low business and high on holidays, i pre planned a weekend off in office and visit a nearby gateaway.Few resorts were shirt listed but none of them could materialise b'use of few uncertainities.Finally as if it was destined, suddenly just 2 days ahead of actual travel, all logistics got worked out.Saturday to Monday, stay at Motel Visava, extended family..and we were on our way!!

Travel is more fun when you have more people.We checked with Mahesh and he willingly joined us.We left Home by 11 am. Plan was to pick up Mahesh on Mumbai Goa HW near Wadkhal naka.This time we took a different route thru JVLR but due to some confustion ended up in Thane and then taking Thane Belapur to reach Vashi.Stopped at Kamat's for a quick lunch by 2.30 pm.Wadkhal is hardly 30-40 mins drive from there.We reached there first.Mahesh didnt took long and after picking him up we resumed our journey towards Mahad which is another 80 km approx from there.Me & Mahesh took the wheel turn by turn and reached our
IMG_6137
hotel in Mahad - Motel Visava by 5.30 pm.

Motel Visava is a welcome new place for stay in Raigad district of Maharashtra.It has been renovated just 18 months back but in its new look it offers all the possible amenities of a 3 Star hotel.Clean rooms, good choice of restaurants. Most importantly its location is ideal.25 kms from Raigad fort,60 kms from Mahabaleshwar. All these place are good 1 day picnics if you make this hotel your base.In fact urban and folks with family who wants reasonable level of comforts dont think have a better choice in this area.We were all were tired from a 6 hr travel so after checking in, we ordered some hot bhajias and tea.After unwinding a bit, all except Nam's mom stepped out.We needed few things for Sai hence we decided to step in city area of Mahad.Looked like it was a special day for some south indian communities.They had some sort of religious procession going on in main street.Syncronised music,colourful participants they made us stop and enjoy their rituals of song and dance for some time.It was fun to watch it!Then we picked up our stuff and came back to Hotel.That night
IMG_6142
we ate in their Veg restaurant ""Aswad"".

Plan for next day was to visit Raigad fort, also known as ""Shivtirtha"" among many Maratha devotees.We left around 9 am post breakfast at the hotel.Locals have suggested that owing to weekend there will be rush and one of the ways to avoid that is leave early n morning.Base of the fort is around 25 kms from the hotel but the road is bumpy at places so it takes you around 70-90 mins to reach there.At the base is a village named ""Pachad"".Its here that Mother of Shivaji - Jijamata rests in piece.In her last days, b'use of health issues she made this place at the base of the fort her home and its here where she brethe her last.For those who enjoy walking up, there is a gate from where one can enter and start the trekking.Local help is recommended as its a good 90-120 mins trail.For others Govt of State of Maharashtra has set up a nice Rope way which takes you around 20 mins to reach on top.Ticket cost are reasonable and facilities are decent.The place where we alight is actually the back end of the fort.Like any other
IMG_6174
fort there are guides available who can offer their recitation of the fort's glory along with key places on the Maratha Capital in hr or two.The fort is witness to some of the most glorious moments of Maratha empire's history so for those who dont know much of this, this service is useful.They charge approx 200-300 bucks for an hour.First up after climbing a few steps we end up at ""Rani Mahal""- Residences of Royal Ladies.A narrow path from there connects you to the public celebration areas on the left and govt offices on the right along with KIng's palace.Few min walk from there is King's court where Shivaji Maharaj used to conduct his daily darbar.Almost for everything what remains now is just a pale shadow of its past glory.Its believed that most of the buildings on the forts and gates were designed and built by the then best architect named ""Hiroji Indulkar"".One of the specialities of his construction can be witnessed in the King's court.There the distance between King's throne and the main gate is 50-75 meters but even now if anyone whispers anything at the gate can be clearly heard at the throne.We were lucky that while we
IMG_6179
were there, one of the enthusiast actually demonstrated that to those present there!!Amazing piece of work.Just tells us how much developed our architecture was in 16th century!!All these structures are part of one big complex.Outside this one can walk to the market place where some remains can be seen.And a 10 -12 mins walk from there we reach the ""Jagdishwar Temple"" - Lord Shiva temple on the fort where Shivaji Maharaj used to offer his prayers each day.He was known to be a avid Shiva disciple.Just outside the temple, there is his Final resting place ""Shiv Samadhi"".Shivaji Maharaj is the most admired and worshipped personality of Maratha community.His rise and creation of Maratha Empire is a story of inspiration, courage and conviction to not only Marathas or Indian but also to communities worldwide.Vietnamese Prime Minister for example when visited India some years back publicly acknowledged Shivaji Maharaj's tactics to be his country's inspiration to beat the mighty US in US Vietnam war in 70's.We all felt immensely blessed and satisfed seeing,feeling the glory at the Maratha Capital.

It was late afternoon by now and we were tired of walking all over the fort.So after being back at the starting

point we had some light snacks and alighted to the base from the cable car again.The visit to Ragad cannot be complete w/o visiting Inspiration of Shivaji Maharaj himself - His mother.Resting place of Jijamata lies few kms from the base at a village called ""Pachad"".We visited that on the way, offered our respects and thanked her for blessing us with greatest son of the soil in the form of Shivaji Maharaj.After being back at the hotel, we spent time relaxing our tired legs and overwhelmed minds.

Next day was checkout and return journey.We had breakfast at the hotel...typical Maharashtrian one.It was around 1030 am. On the way we decided to stop at the Hot water sprngs at a village called ""Sav"".its On highway few kms from Mahad, 15 mins drve may be. One has to cross Savitri River in a boat to reach that village.There is only 1 boat owned by one of the locals who charges 20 bucks per person for return trip.Sadly no one was around when we reached there. We inquired around and finally were able to locate the guy.2 school going kids, small boat, 10 mins trip it was fun! On the other side,

we reached the springs after walking thru a local colony.People have contructed some cement borders etc around it and many use that hot water for bath and washing clothes. Some of it may look sad but thats how it was!We stepped in for a quick 10 mins in the water to feel it.Water was moderately warm.It is believed to contain some good medicinal properties.After spending some time we resumed our trip back.Road in patches was rough.Sai was comfortable Mahesh driving but since she was asleep, Mahesh took the.Good he did b'use he saved at least 30-45 mins from there till our first milestone which was Wadkhal naka where he dropped off.We had quich bites at a nearby hotel and then carried on.Gladly all the way upto home we didnt get too much traffic.We were home by 6 pm which was decent.After a long while it was a nice mini picnic we had as a family.High point was clearly visiting the fort and feeling that spirit...Spirit of fight against evil, for respect and for people.

Now I feel like I'm in India! I didn't feel it in the outskirts of Delhi; everything I saw looked like rural Cambodia: the markets, the traffic, the litter and rubbish everywhere, the poverty, the begging. Indian children are also beautiful, but their dark eyes seem liquid, watery. On Saturday my young roommate, Meaghan, and I explored a few malls near Delhi; we had some free time, and Singjy, our guide, suggested we might want to do that, and take the metro back to near our hotel. In the States I hate malls; I never go shopping except at very alternative stores. (Thank you, Bill, for handling all our shopping needs at home!) I truly hate malls, their sterility, their stale air, their horrible lighting, the things for sale that nobody really needs, and the constant music piped throughout can drive me crazy within ten minutes. (Ask Bill.) These Delhi malls were a bit better, but neither of us wanted to spend our afternoon there, so we stopped for lunch, and then I finally talked her into walking back to the hotel. Singjy said it was about six kilometers, so maybe 3 1/2 miles. Nothing much.

It felt good to walk as lunch had been heavy with oil and the weather was distinctly chilly, so, since we had no map and just a vague idea of where we should go, we decided to follow the overhead metro track as Singjy had said to take it to the end. Lots of traffic, horns honking, broken sidewalks, large puddles and muddy areas, people everywhere, plus there were many loose dogs, goats, cows, pigs, and one camel. We stopped and asked for directions several times, but either Meghan remembered seeing some landmark we passed, or I did, so between the two of us we eventually found our way back. Singjy was impressed; no one else on his tours had ever done that, successfully, at least. For dinner we had a feast of spicy vegan Indian foods, so many delicious offerings I couldn't eat them all. That was my first day in India, but I still did not have a distinct feel of the country. But Singjy told me to be patient; that it would come.

Yesterday we drove and drove and drove, through massive traffic (similar to Bangkok's traffic, but the roads here are much worse) for most of the day, heading to Roopangarh. We stopped for another feast at lunch; if we keep eating like this we will gain a lot of weight in a very short time! Finally we drove through streets so narrow no car was ever meant to travel there. Houses and storefronts were ancient. The market was crowded; we almost couldn't pass, as motos and cows and goats and people and other cars all were trying to pass by too, so we waited, then started, then quickly braked and waited again, but finally we squeezed by the tiny, narrow street that led up to Roopangarh Fort, where we were to spend the night.

Built in 1648, Roopangarh Fort is forbiddingly impressive. ""There is your room, up there,"" Singjy pointed very high up. We climbed up slippery cobblestones reinforced with patches of cement, and then climbed even higher up steep stairways to the top floor of the fort, and there was our room. Huge, enormous; it was big enough to be a hall where many people could have had a banquet or held a dance! It was gorgeous, in a medieval sort of way, and also very cold. We quickly put on long pants and extra sweaters, and then followed our guide down to the village beside the market.

Groups of children soon surrounded us, asking ""One for two! One for two!"" We didn't know what they meant, but it was obvious they wanted us to take their pictures with our cameras. Unlike in many other countries where I have travelled, they did not want money afterwards for having their photos taken; they were delighted just to see the photos of themselves. (Singjy told us later that ""one for two"" meant ""one photo.""😉 I took many, many photos of beautiful children on that walk. Kids would run out from houses and corners calling ""One more!"" and stand there smiling. Some even dragged out babies so we might be more inclined to photograph them holding a baby. I took photo after photo until it became dark. ""No more!"" I told the children. We had a thoroughly delightful walk through the village, and when we returned to Fort Roopangarh the lights had been turned on; the high buildings looked like a fairyland out of the Middle Ages. This, now, is India! I truly felt welcomed to another era, a planet distinct from all the other countries I know. Now I feel one of the unique flavors of this country and cannot wait to have many others revealed to me. This is India!

Leopard in Satpura
The ghost of the forest
When we go to the Reni Pani jungle lodge Amith – the naturalist who was to look after us – asked us what we wanted to see. We knew tiger and leopard sightings were very rare, so we said we wanted to see a sloth bear.

We set off at 5.45am in unexpectedly and unwelcome cold. 8 centigrade is fine in London when you’re dressed for it but less good when all you have is a shirt and a fleece sweater. The park is beautiful, and we were happy to drive round seeing the more common animals such as gaur and deer. We had just stopped for our picnic breakfast when there was a noise that produced much excitement amongst the guide, naturalist and driver. Alarm calls from the langurs scared by a predator. Did we dare to hope to see something? We drove off at high speed and had a brief glimpse of a leopard. The other jeep stayed put, hoping it would reappear, but our team decided we should move to where the leopard seemed to be heading. Their instincts were right. We found it again, or more accurately, Tracker Thomas first spotted it moving on the hillside,
Sloth bear
Balu the sloth bear snuffling forwards slowly
and were privileged to enjoy 50 minutes of watching a large male leopard prowling around, up and down the hill in full view, and eventually crossing the road.

In the afternoon, Amith declared we would concentrate on finding a sloth bear. And he did! They are small by grizzly bear standards, and look like a black furry lump moving around until you see their face, with a long white snout. They use this to excavate termite hills, digging a hole and then making a loud snuffling noise as they suck in all the termites. They live up to their name by moving very ponderously, scuffling through the leaves as they go.

What a day! And the next day, we had a brief glimpse of a female leopard stalking, and found not one but two more sloth bears including a female carrying her cubs on her back (though to be honest, it was quite dark and she was a bit indistinct).

The stay at Reni Pani was marred only by David succumbing to the inevitable bout of Delhi belly on the last night, necessitating an extra day’s stay for him to recover. After 2 days of 11 hours/day
Leopard in Satpura
Now you see him......
in the jeep gong round the park, Sara was quite glad to have a rest day, and David certainly was!

P2 off in search of more prey
It was a gruelling 9 hour drive from Satpura to the next game park Tadoba, with just three 5 minute comfort breaks and a brief stop for the driver to have a cup of tea. You have to be tough to travel with the Thomases! The journey was made longer by the fact that there were virtually no signs to show the way to the lodge, so our poor driver was constantly phoning them to ask for instructions, and checking with people en route.

Svasara Lodge is owned by a big fat man who always scowls at everyone, but it is managed by a very nice Indian couple who speak posh English and are always very jovial. 530am alarm call, 600am coffee and biscuits, 610am departure to the nearby park gate. Bureaucratic procedures followed, extortion of 500 rupees for having a nice camera (no receipt, of course but they do it to everyone including the Indian visitors) and off we go. Tadoba lacks the interesting terrain of Satpura but does have lots of tigers, though only 10% of the park is open, but that is the Forest Department in India.......we do see a tiger though in fairly short order, sitting
The chase
on a little island where it has taken a recently killed spotted deer. She emerges from the grass, then retires to rest and eat. We thought this was a good sighting but that was before what we were to see tomorrow......

Plenty of deer, gaur, sambhar, birds, crocs......you get about 2.5 hours off between morning and afternoon drives, meaning by dinnertime you are pretty shattered. Early nights all round.



22 Feb

The day dawned grey, overcast and raining (what is going on, this is India in February?!). We set off into the park and it starts to rain again, thunder and lightning. “Please we go back to the gate yes” says the driver, back we go, and sit glumly in a bamboo hut with cloying mud on our feet and mosquitoes buzzing around. Ten minutes later we are off again, rain has stopped as we drive off through the warm mist. Can't see very far and the animals have stayed in bed. A lousy morning beckons.

We photograph a few deer, some birds and a mother owl who hoots out of a tree at us while her two babies peer anxiously out from behind
After the kill
her and the father looks sternly down from another branch. We set off back towards the gate when on a wide metalled forest road our progress is halted as there are three Gypsies in front with people photographing some wild dogs in the brush to the side of the road ahead of us. We are pleased to see our very first wild dog.

Then for some reason our tracker chooses that moment to turn around and look back down the road and all hell breaks loose. “Tiger! 50 yards back on road!” he yells. We careen backwards at about 40 mph, one hand on the rollbar and one shooting pictures. We stop about 20 feet from the tiger that is just sitting there looking into the bushes. This is P2 who we had glimpsed yesterday. Suddenly she looks back down the road and sees a wild dog advancing towards us, then two more appear. They trot down the road oblivious to the danger. The tIger rises, tenses, moves forwards, still no reaction. She crouches, then flattens herself and starts to crawl forward. All this about 30 feet from us. When the three dogs are about 30 feet from her she springs, the dogs yelp and scatter, weaving, trying throw her off, but she swerves left and right with such awesome power and grace. After about five seconds the little dog veers right but is doomed. The tiger goes after it into the brush to the side of the road. We realise that the driver has been shooting backwards all this time in pursuit. We stop and two long blood-curdling screams from the dog rend the forest air. We are all shaking, including the driver and guide. The tiger emerges from the brush with the corpse in its mouth and settles down behind a clump of bamboo, its head and shoulders visible, and surveys its kill. There is utter awed silence in the forest apart from the continuous click of shutters from the four Gypsies. The tiger drops its prey, stands and walks slowly parallel to our vehicles no more than 8 feet away. It knows there are more dogs ahead and it has more business to attend to........



So now we are the celebrities in the Lodge for the day. After lunch we had a pleasant drive, saw the tiger again in the area of its kill, wandering off into the brush again. The excitement of the morning had obviously overcome Sara by now who succumbed to a touch of heat stroke but fortunately was fine by the next morning.

The David Sasoon Library
And then before you know it it’s the last train journey the last city you will visit in India and the last days and hours. The train journey was lovely the country side was very hilly we seemed to be going up into the mountains passing through great valleys. It was only a 3 hour trip and it went very quickly. What I love about Indian trains is that you are constantly plied with drinks and food as well as that you can order breakfast, lunch or dinner. I had omelet toast which usually means there is chilli in the egg and it comes as a sandwich mildly warm and hardly toasted but amazing how the orders are taken on long slips of paper and that you always getthe right order. The Mumbai train station- the Victoria Terminus - has got to be one of the most beautiful train station the world and looks more like a Gothic palace than a train station. The British sure knew how to build. Our hotel was near the beach front a big sweeping bay (that at night is known as the Queens necklace because of the twinkling lights) that you would love to take
The Taj Hotel
a swim in but unfortunately the water is toxic to us foreigners, lined with mildly decaying art deco buildings. If painted they would be grand as some of them are.

We cleaned up and went out to explore the city. Terry has been here 4 times before but this was my very first time. There is a huge park called the Oval Maidan (sounds like where the cricket term maiden oval came from) where hundreds of people are out playing cricket on Sundays. In fact there are about 3 of these large open areas in close proximity. On weekends it’s who knows who playing and during the week we saw a lot of school groups practicing there. Of course this is India and everywhere we have been, on any dusty patch even, you will find a game of cricket going on. Colaba is vibrant area of old Mumbai where all the old beautiful buildings are. The streets are wide and lined with people selling everything you can think of. More fashion jewelry, pashmina’s, clothes, trinkets, toys the list can go on and on. It’s all so confusing for a girl and one really needs a girlfriend to come spend
The shoe shine wallah
time here shopping. As it was Sunday it was busier than ever and here we saw on the pavement what I had seen in Kolkata a young girl doing her tight rope walk act. It was almost identical in every way – the child so young how many hours a day does she do this? I am sure she keeps the family alive with her performance as everyone who takes a picture has to put money in the box and why not it’s only fair. We wandered through the markets past Leopolds Café made famous in the book Shantaram - people queuing to get in delicious looking cakes and pastries tempt you in the open to the street cake stand, then down to the harbor and the two iconic buildings the Taj Hotel and the Gateway to India. Both imposing and majestic. I had my sandals cleaned and fixed by a shoe shine guy. They were so ingrained with dust and I was feeling embarrassed about them but after he had finished they looked new and ready for another long journey. Thanks Naot (Israeli shoes)you make the best sandals in the world!!!!! 0n our meanderings we went past the David
Leopolds Cafe
made very famous by the book Shantaram and yes i have read it and had to come here for at least a drink
Sassoon Library which had a wonderful exhibition about his life and the contribution the Sassoon Family had made in India and Asia as far as Shanghai. They had built quite a few synagogues in the city as well as schools, libraries and hospitals.



Breakfast on the roof with a view of the city and the local newspaper is a great way to start the day. Of course it was off to the main markets for another mind blowing experience. Alleyways full of crumbling buildings that you can see were once beautiful, and of course once again crammed to the hilt – I wish I could transport you all for the sounds and smells (ok so some of the smells not that great) often of burning incense which can only mean two things food stalls or temples. You usually come across the sellers of offerings before you see the temple and they can be in the weirdest places too. Offerings are made at shrines verywhere outside shops, stalls, in trees. There are about 18 million people who live in Mumbai and every single motor vehicle toots their horn all the time so there is always a lot of
Gateway of India
noise. There is a lot of movement in the market of long trolleys moving goods around and you had better get out the way as they don’t stop for you. Pseople, bikes and cars- if they can squeeze through they will try and then you trying to make your way too. It can all become too much after a few hours. We started off at the main temple the Mumbadevi Temple. We have not seen wandering cows like in other cities. Here rather they are tethered and well fed. Usually old ladies sitting with bundles of grass and people pay her to feed them. So that whiled away a good few hours in fact time seems to really fly past when observing life.

The next day we hired a taxi for the day and drove into the very up market Juhu area. We popped in to see a delightful Jain temple brightly painted with lots of friendly people. Then the hanging gardens on the top of the hill – the Jains do not bury their dead they leave them out in the open like Buddhists’ and they are eaten by the eagles and I am sure the crows. There
Good morning to the sun
are many birds in India that is one of the most pleasant things. Well not the crows really as they have a croaking cry but are funny to watch and cheeky as all hell. Next on the itinary was Ghandi’s house – a lovely old house set in a leafy tree lined road. The floors were tiled with beautiful Victorian tiles and whole house was set up with pictures, sayings and rooms showing movies of his life. The room in which he stayed was as it would have been. Our lunch stop was a great local where I had a delicious butter chicken and Terry had mutton biriyani his staple. A quick stop at the dhobi ghats to see thousands of mostly men, doing the washing of the city. Hotels make use of this service and it’s quite amazing. You get harassed like hell by the poor - young girls with babies on their arms begging you to buy things you really don’t want. Our last stop was the synagogue well one of them there are a couple in town. Mumbai boasts about 3500 Jews and they do get a minyan for Shabbat but unfortunately I will not be here
Beautiful flower offering
so it was just a visit and of course I had to purchase something to help with the upkeep of the shul. Outside there was a heavy military presence which made me think back to the terrorist attack in 2008 – there is always a possibility of an attack so one must be prepared.

I have loved my time here and hope to tell you all in person all the wonderful things about this journey that I have forgotten in this blog– the little snippets and cameos that hopefully I would have captured in my pictures – and of course Terry’s. No good internet here at the moment so I might have to send this from home tomorrow. Even though I have loved every moment here and seen so many changes - well it has been a quarter of a century since I was last here! Some things stay the same which makes the flavor of India – I am looking forward to coming home tonight.

Daulatabad fort
The caves at Ellora truly take your breath away. There are 35 of them (mercifully you don’t get to visit them all!) hewn out of a basalt cliff. There are Jain, Hindu and Buddhist temples and monasteries, each with different art forms, carved between 600 A.D and 1100 A.D.

The most impressive of all is the Kailasha temple. It’s a series of temple buildings created to form the shape of a giant chariot. The whole thing is carved from stone out of the cliff – so they had to cut down four stories or more from the top of the cliff, leaving a big lump in the middle, then gradually carve out the various buildings, ending up with the ornate carvings on the walls. It covers an area twice the size of the Parthenon! And despite Ellora getting half a million visitors a year (only 20,000 of whom are foreigners) it did not feel over-crowded.



After a short break for lunch, we went to Daulatabad, where a huge fort sits atop a massive rocky outcrop. The place was built with defence in mind, and was impregnable to attack though not, sadly, to attackers bribing someone on the
Kailasha temple, Ellora
inside. There are S shaped entrances, a myriad doors leading into dead ends where attackers could be pelted with rocks and other unpleasant projectiles, a massive moat and – worst of all for visitors – a long pitch black tunnel. Near claustrophobia set in, made infinitely worse by the stench of bat shit from the thousands of bats who have taken up home there. Sara developed a migraine at this point, and stumbled down the long slope back to the entrance to the relative cool of the car and some suitable medication. Who says taking every medicine under the sun on holiday isn’t a sensible thing to do?

Bibi ka-makbara
The poor man's Taj Mahal - not even any water in the pool!
After an overnight flight from London, we spent a long boring afternoon in Mumbai airport waiting to catch our one hour hop to Aurangabad. Arriving at the Taj hotel the car was checked for bombs with the mirror on the stick and our bags were X rayed before we were let through the ram proof barrier. Always slightly disconcerting but this is the 21stcentury in a country that has known its share of terrorism.

The “modern” Aurangabad was founded in 1610 by Malik Amber, an Ethiopian slave who rose to become the prime minister of the local Nizam. Aurangzeb, the sixth and last of the Great Mughal Emperors, made the city his capital in 1653 as he pursued his relentless campaigns in the Deccan till his death here in 1707.

Today was relatively undemanding, a city tour starting with the Aurangabad caves (not in fact caves but temples and monasteries carved out of a cliff face around the 5th century AD). Totally deserted as it is not on the tourist trail. Next was the Bibi-ka-Maqbara, built in 1679 by Aurangzeb's son as a mausoleum for his mother and Aurangzeb's wife. It’s a poor man's imitation of the Taj Mahal.
Sara with her military escort




The highpoint here was Sara being mobbed - no other word for it – by a large group of female (and male) Army cadets all keen to be photographed with the pale blonde haired foreigner. A few wanted David in the photo but he clearly did not have celebrity status.

Eating dosa
AnnaLaxmi and Prenka having lunch in Chaudi
The best thing about the Palolem beach is that they are not allowed to cut down any trees especially coconut trees. You might even have a tree trunk going right through your bedroom. This also means there is a dense forest of trees right down to the water. I have to say the tidal line is also incredibly clean and one I find remarkable as the rest of the beach, town and country is completely different where no one thinks twice about dropping their rubbish where they are. It might all change when the monsoon comes and all the rubbish from the fishing boats comes floating in and all the rubbish on the land gets washed into the sea. As I went to the shop with Annalaxmi she peeled open an ice-cream for her daughter and dropped the paper as each segment broke off. I was cringing but bided my time till an opportunity arose later where I could tell her that I loved India but hated the fact that people dropped their litter everywhere she said she agreed and that she did not litter – so she had no idea in my mind that is as to what I was
Annalaxmis impecably clean house
One room everything had it's place and was spotlessly clean
on about.

I had bought Terry a new SD card for his camera when in Chaudi and then as luck would have it mine started giving me problems. I put it in my computer and it would not read it. So I took it out and put it in again and the same thing then I saw it was coming apart. So with advice from one of the boys working here was to quickly download my pictures via my camera so if anything else happened at least I had them on my computer. It was good advice and I followed it. So it meant I had to go back to Chaudi and get myself a new sd card. Even though there are lots of shops at the beach we could not find anyone selling sd cards until we had bought one in Chaudi typical!!!

There seem to be quite a few older British tourists who come here for a long while during the cold English winter months. I can really see why. It’s a very pleasant temperature at this time and if you eat at local restaurants not the tourist type you can really live very cheaply. I
Dogs playing on beach

must say I do like the local cuisine but can tire of curries all the time. Its good to be able to get a break now and then. I did try and do a cooking class but as it is the end of the season they could not guarantee anything and even though I left my number I did not hear from them. Oh cousin Warren where are you my friend and cooking companion when I need you!!!!!! We also met a very interesting chap called Jerry who was born in Calcutta and when I mentioned I was Jewish he immediately said so was he. This intrigued me no end and I loved hearing the story of his life. He now lives in London and has done for the majority of his life but still speaks Hindi fluently. He took us to a lovely restaurant called Kates Place which was made out of wood and reminded me of a Thai teak house. We went further along the road than we had ever been and it was in a part of the village I had not been to and never knew existed. I had a fish xacuti and rice which is
Russian tourists
a local curry that was mild and delicious. For me everything is a type of curry. After dinner we walked back along the beach and ended up chatting for hours on his verandah. We could not resist a midnight drink so stopped in at the all night Star Café which was not as lively as we imagined. Its open 24 hours and we had gone there for breakfast a couple of times and seen some partygoers that that kept us amused they were so drunk could hardly stand but lots of fun to watch and we didn’t have to deal with the hangover.

It doesn’t matter how long you have at the beach it all goes pretty fast. I had walked every morning the length of the beach bar one. Swam at every opportunity as the water was warm and mostly flat and before I knew it we were back on the train making our way to Pune. This time we shared our cabin with a retired automotive manufacturer and his wife. They loved travelling and he showed me the best way to make my bed it was only a pity it was our last sleeper train. Oh well
Early morning find
a gruesome shot but one about nature - a dead turtle washed up on the beach overnight is breakfast for the crows
it’s a lesson I will not forget. We had to get off at 4 am in the morning and it was the busiest train station we have been to. I could have hung around a little and was dying to take some pictures of the mayhem. People sleeping everywhere, restaurants crowded, trains coming and going. It was freezing on the rickshaw and I had to put a jumper on for the first time since travelling. We were slowing getting higher. We woke up the reception person who let us in and to our surprise we got a small apartment with nothing much in it. There was room marked pantry but no kettle or anything. He said hot water in 10 minutes but it was hot before that. I have been showering Indian style most of the time which is filling a large bucket and pouring it over you. I really like that idea as I don’t feel I am wasting any water a big bucket is ample. This city is famous for the Osho Centre and our hotel Suryia Villa and adjoining restaurant called the Yogi Tree was full of Osho devotees. The food was great there lots of healthy
Boys in home made boat

cakes and brown rice, veggies and tempeh and tofu. We decided to walk to the Aga Khans Palace where Ghandi spent some years under house arrest which of course went via a market. How we love them. There is always something to see in every nook and cranny and I cannot believe the shops that are actually run out of crannies!!!! I think India must be the record for needing the smallest amount of space to run a business. When in Bhubaneshwar we talked about Walmart coming into this country and I hope they never allow it. Free enterprise – not sure how much these folks eek out in a day with what some of them sell but they are working for themselves.

The Ghandi Exhibition is in this palace which of course is set in a lovely garden with wrap around verandahs. His old room is set up as it was. His wife and secretary died here and there ashes are interned in the garden along with Ghandi’s. We must have walked miles and so took a rickshaw home thank goodness. Once I sat down it felt like I could not get up afterwards.

We found a
Mahatma Ghandi's room
while he was interned
nice outside bar for dinner – the place was fairly busy but as time went by it got chockers – there must have been 100 people in there and I was the only woman. We had our favourite masala papads and then some mixed chicken kebabs with garlic nan. The chicken comes with a little salad and I made myself a what they call here a roll – you wrap a bit of meat and salad in the bread its very yummy.
The next day we went to the Rajah Dinkar Kalkar Museum which the Lonely Planet describes as one of Pune’s delights and it truly was. It started out as the private collection of Dr Dinkar Kalkar - I have never seen such an amazing collection of everything. Carved wooden doors, musical instruments jewelry and textiles along with many, many other things in a wonderful old house. If you ever get the chance to go to Pune you should not miss this. The streets around the museum were like being Khatmandu a bit with very old houses looking like some of them should be condemned but you know many people are living inside. As it was Saturday the
Wrap around verandah
streets were heaving with people and stuff. Once again so much stuff you can’t even imagine. Our time flew by and once again it was time to pack our bags ready for the morning sitter train to Mumbai and coming to he end of our journey.

Ghandi's sandles
look at the bottom of the blog for more pics of the Ghandi memorial
My mom and I went out one morning to see Ghandi's memorial thing they have here.
""the Aga Khan Palace was built by Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III in Pune, India. Built in 1892, it is one of the biggest landmarks in Indian history. The palace was an act of charity by the Sultan who wanted to help the poor in the neighbouring areas of Pune, who were drastically hit by famine"" If you care, the link is (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aga_Khan_Palace)

It was really amazing to see the story and pictures of Ghandi. He is always looking down. I don't think I saw a single picture of him looking at the camera or looking up. There were amazing stories, and if you have not read up on Ghandi, you really should. It was an amazing place to be while in India.



Took a weekend trip out of Pune to drive 4 hours to Mumbai. We were picking up April at the Mumbai airport and Jeff and I decided to go early and go see some sights in Mumbai. The only thing I really knew about the trip was that we were going to see the
Jeff Gateway to India
Gates of India. What happened was an extraordinary trip that I hope to recreate next weekend before I need to fly back to the states.

Our driver picked us up at the hotel and we drove 4 hours, he asked us if it was okay for him to play music and we said yes. To my surprise his play list contained and lots of Ludacris. Best trip music ever, or at least the best I could expect under the circumstances.

We arrived to the Gates of India and immediately, Jeff gets ""Taken"" by one of the hustlers outside the monument. What they do is hand you some rice or candy then quickly tie a piece of yarn around your hands and ask for money. I had warned him of this trick a couple of days before at a dinner with some executives we had to attend. I just laughed and walked away and he kind of just went along with it. If it's never happened to you it is kind of fun to play along, but I had watched the hustlers do this in Italy
Gates of India
every morning when I would walk to Dumo. (see Europe travel blog- Milan).

We walked around the Gates of India, because you can't actually go THROUGH them. So why is it called a gate? I don't really know. Jeff and I walk around to where the boats were and they were taking people to Elephanta, an island off the coast of Mumbai that has some really cool temples and stuff to look at. We were trying to buy tickets and then the Photos happened.



In order to explain photos, I think I should elaborate a little more. Apparently it's a big deal to get photos with (white foreigners). I had some people come up to me to ask for a photo, and I said yes. Then it turns into a circus and cluster mess of switching who is standing near me, who's all in the picture, who wants a hug in the picture. This is all fine and dandy, but once one group of people start to do it, more people catch on and then ask for THEIR pictures with you. Effectively this went on long enough to miss the boat we were trying to get
Indian train
on, and we had to wait for the next one.

Jeff and I went on an hour long boat ride out to the island and passed the Mumbai Navy ships and enjoyed the boat ride. We got off the boat by docking next to other boats and then walking across a few boats to get to the actual dock. At the dock you walk a ways then there is a train- it was only something like 10 rupees to ride but I figured it was lazy to ride when you could easily walk. What I didn't know is that if there is offered transportation, you should probably take it. We arrived walking the shore line to a small market area with steps leading up. There were these guys that had chairs attached to two long poles where you could sit in the chair and they would carry you up the stairs. Again, if there is a form of transportation offered , you should probably take it. I still felt like that was a bit lazy, and I did not feel comfortable making someone carry me up a bunch of stairs. By the time I had arrived at the top
Keep your Elephanta clean
of the stairs, I don't think I could have taken another breath. I was drenched in sweat, and tired as all get out. There are little market stalls lining the stairwell so if you stop to take a breath, they try to sell you stuff, so you just look down and keep on moving.

When we got to the Elephanta temples, we saw quite a few. The temples were amazing and carved out of the mountain. It wasn't built from the bottom up like others, it was carved out of the side of the mountain, and there were like 8 or 9 of them and they were HUGE. If you care, (http://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/mtdc/HTML/MaharashtraTourism/TouristDelight/Caves/Caves.aspx?strpage=ElephantaCaves.html.)



At one point, Jeff had to use the facilities, and I waited outside near a fence-line, where another photo opportunity arised when some guys saw me sitting. This one only lasted about ten minutes, but sometimes its hard to smile when you feel so gross and sweaty and nasty and people just really want a photo with you, again, with every combination.

On the other side of Elephanta is a large hill to climb, with more steps. We climbed to the top and
Jeff Photo Ops
the view was amazing. I thought I was going to die, I'm not going to go into details, but I was extremely hung over from the night before. *I'm in my twenties, totally allowed to do this* Got to the top, thought I was going to die, sat down, drank some water, and then I asked Jeff to give his bottle of water to one of the monkeys because that's always fun. I'll upload the video when I have more time one day.

Tim Luck Luck
After hearing good about this place from many friends mouth, it was in my wish list for quite a long! The wish came to the action one Friday night.

What a delightful experience!! The place welcomes you with a typical dhaba atmosphere which is a refreshing change from the usual restaurants. Tables, chairs and charpais are laid out to get an even closer feel of the dhaba. Small elements like a cycle rickshaw, boards in Punjabi language, dhinchak color combinations etc. also add to the ‘flavor’ of the place. The place is spacious; ‘covered’ open air premises with a separate smoking section on an elevated level. Even the bar is designed in a Punjabi styled Tapri.

Coming to food, we had both vegeterian and non-vegeterian items. Every item was superb. To sum it up, we were really enjoying our food. All items were really very well prepared. Every item was served hot. The serving time was perfect, neither too fast, nor too slow. Our server was very polite and friendly.

Overall, we had a superb experience at this place. We are definitely going to go back more than once.

Kudos to Tim Luck Luck…!!!!

from my Krishna
Arrived in Pune after a going away party in Chennai. I missed them so much. I think it has taken me quite a while to warm up to Pune because I was so sad about leaving Chennai. I had friends there, a family if you will. All the staff, and all the US members... we had a happy banter. Arrived in Pune and everything was gone. No more friends, no huge family dinners every night like before. The staff at this new hotel in Pune is so large that ""making friends"" like I did with Pavan and Sunil is next to impossible. It took me a while to feel comfortable walking around alone, usually James or Chelsea would walk with me in Chennai. Today I tried my best to break the biases I have against Pune. I'm sure it's a great city with plenty to do, I just walked in with the wrong attitude.

Today my mother and I had breakfast as usual and took a walk around the smaller areas around the hotel to drop off some dry cleaning and ended up in a very residential area. this would normally be fine, I just never want to seem like
Zara and Mama
I am intruding on people. The way people stare at me I can't tell if I am making them mad or if they are curious or think of me as funny looking. I could never be famous.

Hopefully the next few weeks things will get easier. It is always hard moving to another city, and especially when you don't speak the language and know the customs. I swear sometimes I feel as if I am a small child learning simple things that everyone already knows. It is not fair to compare Chennai to Pune just yet, I need to give a good chance. Some things no matter what remind you that you are in India. Driving is crazy, but not nearly as bad as Chennai. The laundry guy at My Dhobi seems nice, and the driver Guru seems just as nice, but no English.

I am leaving this weekend for Agra to go see the Taj Mahal. Maybe after a good weekend away from a stuffy hotel will do me some good. I am an adventure at heart, not a hotel junkie.

I love you all, and I miss home, but I am living my dreams. Tata
Cookout!
for now!

Me and my husband went to Jain temple, Katraj recently. Though we are not Jains, however, we happen to know facts about Jainism from a friend once.

I must say an awesome place. Cleanliness in the temple is highly appreciated…

While having a walk inside the temple you will get a feel of watching an ancient architecture… we could see Shlokas and Mantras on all the walls. Just get inside the main temple and sit there for some time; the atmosphere will make you feel relaxed and refreshed.

Nice location , Beautiful weather, Pleasant winds, especially during the evening and more over an amazing view of Pune City…

A Must visit place in Pune..!!!

Ajanta CAVES
The World Heritage, Ajanta and Ellora Caves are real treasurers of India back to 200 BC. Ajanta reflects the Buddist believes and Ellora Budist, Hindu and Jainism. Ellora carved between 350-700 AC.

For us the Kailasa Temple is the best. Carved in a monoblock rock. It almost took a century to be finished.

We traveled these two sites in two days staying at Government Guest House at Aurangabad. For Ajanta Caves we took a tour from our guest house which lasted whole day. For Ellora we hired a taxi and with the same taxi we reached to Manmad for the train to N. Delhi .

Both sides were extremely crowded by the students and local visitors.

Kailasa Temple at Ellora may deserve to be in the seven wonders of the World.

See you soon for Golden Temple, Amritsar.

We wish a very happy, healthy and wealthy new year to all.

Mumbai
Made my first trip to India in September. I was admittedly a little bit nervous, having heard all of the catch phrases related to travel in India; sensory overload, in your face, overwhelming, depressing, etc. I visited Mumbai, Dehradun, New Delhi, and Bagalore. I don't know that I have the time to go through each city in detail but overall, I absolutely loved it. And because most of my travel is a mix of business and pleasure I don't always have time to see all of the touristy spots. It may sound strange but India reminded me Brazil in many ways. I don't know how many times I have been to Brazil but I think having so much experience there unknowingly prepared me for India.

MUMBAI: I compare this city to Rio de Janiero (minus Copacabana and other famous beaches). It is hot, sticky, on the water, intimidating in some ways, but beautiful. The culture in India is incredible. So many colors, smells (good and bad), and tastes. Like many places, it is a city of extremes. Extreme wealth, and extreme poverty. I stayed at the Trident Bandra Kurla, in the ""new"" financial district, one block away from the US
Mussoorie
Embassy. Security at all hotels in India is a step above any other place I have been in Latin America. Security gates, metal detectors, etc. I have never felt safer in a hotel. Went to a restaurant called Khyber (www.khyberrestaurant.com), superb. I didn't have any problems with food in India but then again I didn't touch the street food. And I was very strict with my water consumption, which is not usually the case. I only used bottled water, even to brush my teeth. If you want to get sick in India, it is very easy, just eat on the street.

DEHRADUN (Mussoorie): Never been to a place like this in Brazil. One of my favorite spots in India that I visited. Sits at the foot of the Himalayas and is breathtaking. We drove from the airport in small cars to a small mountainside village called Mussoorie. It is my understanding that it was once a very elite weekend destination for the British. Stayed at the Jaypee Residency. Wasn't amazing but it was very cool. The location of this property is hard to beat and the views were incredible. Only ate at the hotel because there weren't many options
Jaypee Residency
Mussoorie
with our limited time.

NEW DELHI: I compare this city to Brasilia. It was basically built in the middle of nowhere to be a capital city. Stayed at the Westin Gurgaon (financial district). Very nice property, excellent food, great gym, pool, etc. And I need to say the the service level in all of the hotels was excellent. Hotel staff tend to be very young in my opionion but they are very hard workers and do their best to make sure you have a great stay. Had a weekend here and made the 8-hour roundtrip drive to Agra to see The Taj Mahal. In a word, phenomenal. I have been to some pretty cool places but the visual you get when you walk through the entry gate at this place takes your breath away. And I will also say it was one of the hottest places I have ever been. There was no wind that day and man, it was sticky. The people watching factor at The Taj is reason enough to go but the structure itself it amazing. Not much else to say here. If you get a chance, go. Delhi also has a beautiful airport.

BANGALORE:
Sunset at The Jaypee
Very quick stop here on my way back home but this was my comparison to Sao Paulo. A city that has crazy amounts of people. Traffic, while crazy in general in this country, stepped it up a notch in Bangalore. Non-stop traffic. Stayed at the Hyatt Bangalore. Rooms were very small but the breakfast was great and the service was also very good.

I flew domestically on Jet Airways. No complaints. They served food on every flight, almost always vegetarian, and very tasty. One of my flights was on a brand new 737, probably the newest plane I have every flown on.

Traffic in India is an experience unlike any other. You have to add an extra 45-60 minutes onto every drive because of the traffic factor.

Food was excellent. Again, I stuck to nice restaurants and hotels so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

Next year I will be adding Kolkata, Madurai, Mahabalipuram, and possibly a pre-India trip to Myanmar. I will let you know how it goes.

November 8th 2013

It's been a couple of weeks since my last update, and a lot has happened! We left Kumily and after a stressful few connections through Kottayam and Ernakulam - we nearly missed the train as our bus and taxi were being held up by traffic! We got an overnight train back up to Goa, which by now we knew pretty well. We stayed in the north in Anjuna and travelled out regularly to Baga and Vagator which are our favourite places as the beaches are gorgeous and the nightlife and hostel life is busy. We also went parasailing! We had so much fun in Goa and met lots of travellers from all over the world as well as making friends with some of the local people working there. I really do love that place, and I'm missing it now whilst I'm writing this from a busy Starbucks in Colaba, Mumbai! It's extremely different here, we arrived off a bus - AC which unfortunately set my asthma off, and found it to be a city of extremes. On one side families line the pavements and children beg for scraps of food and rupee coins and on the other the magnificent Taj Mahal palace hotel stands with other families being waited on hand and foot...it took a while for me to come to terms with this disparity... I really didn't realise how much viewing extreme inequality affects me.... the desperation of the people living here is also a shock to the system, with the sheer number of inhabitants only aggravating the issue. However, given the context, it feels as though the community is strong and celebrations for Diwali have been in full swing and amazing to see. Lights, fireworks, firecrackers, flowers and lots of families together on holiday have been wonderful to see and on Sunday evening we went to the beach and saw all of this such as lanterns being set off, lots of food stalls and families running in and out of the water with wreaths of flowers being left in the sea. The atmosphere was so happy and positive, something I needed after feeling so disheartened about the initial experience in the city. We have also branched out slightly and travelled to Aurangabad, in order for us to able to see both the Ellora and Ajanta caves, which are magnificent ancient Buddhist, Hindu and Jain temples which were carved out of rock faces thousands of years ago, with ancient paintings in some of the caves in Ajanta. Although we enjoyed going to Aurangabad to see these caves, we had a hellish train ride back yesterday - 7 hours in an unbelievably packed carriage - people were sitting on each other and we nearly got crushed as we boarded... local transport is mental here......!!!!!! We also went to see the Elephanta caves which are on an island just outside Mumbai, we got a little boat out to see them. They are also Hindu temples which have been carved out of the rocks, with most of the sculptures being dedicated to Shiva, one of the main Hindu Gods. For the majority of our stay in Mumbai we have been staying in the Salvation Army hostel which is right next to the Taj Mahal palace - talk about differences!!! It is extremely cheap at 250 rupees each, equivalent £2.50 for a room and breakfast! We also had our first taste of couch surfing with a lovely guy called davind who took care of us and another girl from Boston very well for two nights. We are travelling on to Udaipur tonight on another sleeper bus so will arrive tomorrow. Will update again soon!!

Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus
Last night myself and four friends set off on the Mumbai by night tour, an insight into life after dark in this fascinating city. The tour itself only lasted two and a half hours but in that time I saw so many sights, some wonderful and some shocking.

After catching the train to Colaba, we were greeted by our friendly tour guide who explained to us where we would be going that evening.

Our first stop was Chowpatty beach, one of Mumbai's most famous beaches. It is located on Marine drive, a beautiful lit up boulevard which stretches all along the bay. Despite the fact that it was dark at this point, the beach was completely packed with families playing games, eating and building sandcastles. The place was so full of life and excitement, much like you would expect a beach to be during the day, but our guide explained that the families tend to only come here after dark. Noticing that there were a lot of babies and very young children around, who in England would be going to sleep at this time, we asked our guide what time children usually go to bed here. Of course it
Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus
varies, but we were told on average they go to bed at 1 - 2am and get up for school at 6:30am - not very much sleep at all! Unfortunately, despite being such a popular place for fun and recreation, Chowpatty beach also seems to be a popular place for waste disposal and the shallows were thick with rubbish and sewage.

Our next stop was the Banganga tank, an ancient, holy tank of water believed to have healing powers. It is a huge rectangular tank, with concrete steps climbing up at each side. We were told that Hindus come to this sacred place to bathe and wash themselves. It is believed that the water comes from the Holy Ganges river and was brought there by the God Rama, whilst on his journey to rescue his wife Sita. We were lucky enough to visit this special place during Diwali and there were people gathered on the steps with sparklers and setting off fireworks.

We then visited a Jain Temple. I don't know very much about Jainism, but our guide explained that Jain's do not worship a God, but instead look to those who have achieved certain stages of spiritual
Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus
enlightenment. The temple itself was a huge white marble structure, beautifully decorated with colourful lights, intricately painted ceilings and brightly coloured idols, statues and paintings. It was the most beautiful temple I have ever seen and I would have liked to have stayed there longer, however, keen to reach our next destination before it shut, we were only able to have a brief look around the temple.

After leaving the temple we drove to Kamala Nehru park, referred to by our guide as the hanging gardens, situated on Malabar Hill. The view from this park was breath-taking, you can see the spectacular view of chowpatty beach, marine drive, the lights of the city and the Arabian sea. Our guide said that this used to be the location of a tower if silence. I learnt that the tower of silence is the means of disposal of the dead for people of the Parsi faith. We were told that Parsis believe that earth, water and fire are sacred, therefore they do not bury or cremate the dead. Instead they hang the bodies in a tower of silence and allow the vultures and eagles to dispose of them. Our guide explained that
Me and the girlies at the hanging gardens, overlooking Marine Drive and Chowpatty Beach
this no longer happens in the hanging gardens but instead at a location further along Malabar Hill. On our way to the next stop the guide pointed out the tower of silence. In the darkness we could just about make out the tower, surrounded by trees and lit by a single light. I have to confess that this eerie sight sent a shiver down my spine.

We then travelled to Mumbai's red light district, Kamathipura. Our guide explained that this place is something that people know about but don't talk about. He told us that the girls do not work here through their own free will, instead they are brought here by trafficking, told they will be given a good job and somewhere safe to live. Unfortunately,the reality is quite the opposite. Once they start work they are not allowed to leave until they have made enough money for their brothel keeper. However, by that point, the psychological damage is so great that they cannot do anything else and end up trapped. He told us that rehabilitation is very difficult and many of the girls' families will not take them back in. HIV/AIDS is also a huge problem here.
Marine Drive lit up
Even before we reached Kamathipura, I was appalled just hearing about it. The streets themselves were crowded, run down and had a grimey, dangerous feel about them. Seeing some of the girls stood out on the street and knowing of their harsh reality, I felt shocked and saddened.

Our final stop was Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, India's busiest railway station. It is a huge beautiful building, victorian gothic in style and a UNESCO world heritage site.

DSC_0015
So I went to India. Again. I didn’t mean to. It just kind of, happened. Quite spontaneously a friend of mine mentioned that he was going home to Pune, for Diwali festivities and asked whether I would like to join (I assumed it was a rhetorical question and my flight was booked a few days later).

Whilst this may have been my first trip to the ‘motherland’ in many ways it was my first. It was the first time that I loved it instantly and ongoingly and let myself be taken by its breathtaking beauty, it’s the first time I stayed with an Indian family and travelled with a local, it’s the first time I allowed myself to indulge in guilt free feasting all fortnight, it’s the first time I engaged my linguistic capabilities to learn the national language and really it’s the first time I let go. For that is what there is to do in India; is to “leave life alone”, as a wise friend had put it. I didn’t interfere with the quiet chaos of the roads, or the deafening silence of the trees, or the sweet stinging of mosquito bites, or the intoxicating air of the
DSC_0030
mountains or the eye watering burn of spices, or the smell of the vast contrast between rich and poor, or the tangible romance embedded in the Indian air. I let it all be, and the result was astounding. My entire being was saturated with the Indian experience of myself. Having an Indian heritage and experiencing the full weight of that heritage are two very different things, I discovered on this trip. Perhaps during my previous visits I was not mature enough to see that or experience it, or perhaps I became ready to see what life had to show me. Either way, I am infinitely grateful.

It’s difficult to pinpoint experiences and I wish I could describe them in chronological journal style as I have done before but it’s difficult to encompass the entirety of the experience with a day to day breakdown since each day was drenched in substances like fresh sugar cane juice, or hot Indian wind sweeping through my hair whilst riding on a bike, or the taste of poetic Hindi dropping like honey into my ears, or love, curiosity and carefreeness in the eyes of strangers.

That said, there are some special occasions that
DSC_0055
are worthy of mention:

My 31st birthday: which did not go amiss, with a cake, some candles and a small party of people to share the wishes that I blew into the candles.

Diwali: the Hindu festival of light. It has been a longstanding dream to experience the full technicolour vivacity of that celebration in India and this year I got my chance; the divas lit outside and around the home made the place truly magical. The evening ended with standing on the rooftop terrace being showered with fireworks, all of them cascading light in a cadenza of colour and noise, it was an experience that mere words cannot do justice to.

Sinhagad: to say that the mountains at Sinhagad were majestic is an understatement of mammoth proportions. I recall one moment of solitude when I stood atop the mountain, drinking in it’s majesty, it’s energy and thrill of beauty. To expand into such a wide open space whilst measuring one’s infinitesimal position against the backdrop is a glorious feeling. The road trip itself was fun too, singing to old Bollywood songs.

Alundi: There was nothing special about Alundi; which is why I loved it. A
DSC_0065
village, with the slow paced intricacies of village life. The gentle swaying of trees in the hot breeze or the dust swept up by a passing truck, or the soft laughter of children outside a home. These are the simplicities that made Alundi, and all other villages special. We sat, under the cool shade of an empty temple for some time, talking, lazing, sharing that special moment. For all the fast paced materialism of my London lifestyle – that moment was priceless.

Family: If I said that I stayed with one of the most loving and welcoming families in all India, I would say it with conviction. My friend’s parents stretched out their arms, their hearts and their home so far that I practically fell with a hard thud of love upside my stressed out head. It took me no more than a nanosecond to surrender to that love. Speaking of which, in true customary fashion, I was overfed. A lot. I was called a ‘sparrow’ for my Western dietary tendency of eating small amounts of food (nuts and grains as preference). Well that soon changed. My friend’s mother ensured a consistent supply of amazing food, not least sweet
DSC_0073
delicacies to satisfy my inner sugar monster. I am surprised that my teeth did not dissolve in sugar to be honest. My dentist would be horrified. My post vacation tummy is furious. Just this morning it was screaming ‘what? Where is my hot chapatti with fresh homemade butter and sugar? What do you mean we are having a banana today?’.

Food family and friends. That composition is enough to make a magical life anywhere but India really is something special. Experiences to highlight, remember and replicate: The food market at Pimpery, the mountains at Sinhagad, Things I would not recommend: walking around in the evening dusk without mosquito repellent, continuing to eat on an upset stomach, or losing a visa; I would most definitely not recommend that.

October 25th 2013

Pretty buildings in Colaba
On Tuesday we went to visit Elephanta Island. It is an island in Mumbai harbour, roughly 9km off the coast, known famously for it's rock - cut cave temples. The carvings and sculptures in the caves were very impressive, although many have begun to crack and bits have fallen off. There wasn't very much information on the island with regards to the history behind these caves, but I have since read that it's thought they were made between 450 and 750 AD. Sadly there are no elephants on Elephanta Island (that I'm aware of!), it was given it's name by the Portugese, who discovered a large elephant sculpture at the entrance, which has since collapsed.

The island itself is beautiful, covered in trees and is very peaceful. We saw lots of monkeys with babies which were cute from a distance, but the mothers got very angry if anyone got too close, needless to say I kept as far away as possible!

The journey to Elephanta Island was quite a trek, but very much worth it. We had to get a rickshaw to Andheri station, train to Colaba, taxi to the gateway of India, ferry to the Island and then
Gateway of India
Me and my roommate Melissa
walk up a huge stone staircase to the caves (phew!). This was my first experience of a train journey in India. There are carriages which are for women only, which is good as I have heard that trains can be very dangerous here. It was crowded, hot and dirty, but I still really enjoyed the journey to Colaba as I got to see more of the city.

Colaba is a part of Mumbai, very popular with tourists, home to markets, the Gateway of India and the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. On this particular day we came here specifically to catch the ferry to Elephanta Island, although I will definitely be coming back here for the markets and to explore. Hungry from the first part of our journey we decided to stop for food at Leopolds cafe, known for being the site of a terrorist attack in 2008 as well as featuring heavily in Shantaram (one of my favourite books). Before boarding the ferry we managed to get some good group pictures in front of the Gateway of India.

My work here so far has included dancing on a popular television show, Big Boss, which is similar to Big Brother. It is a fantastic opportunity, as we get to appear on national television and dance alongside the host, Bollywood star Salman Khan. The choreography is really fun and we always wear bright, colourful costumes. So far I have appeared in five episodes of Big Boss and thoroughly enjoyed it.

The set itself is located in a town called Lonavala, which is in the mountains and roughly a three hour drive from Andheri. It's such a beautiful place, and even though the journey there is so long, it never bothers me because the views along the way are spectacular. Just driving through Mumbai itself is fascinating, it's a vast expanse of shanty towns and modern skyscrapers that seems never-ending. As we drove away from the city the landscape became increasingly green and rural, and I could see the dark green mountains in the distance. Driving further up, along the twisting, winding mountain road the views became increasingly impressive: mist and clouds hanging low over the lush green peaks, monkeys sat at the edges of the road. As we neared Lonavala, I looked out of the car window to see the spectacular view of Mumbai far below. We normally drive to the set early in morning and then return after dark, both views are amazing, but at night seeing those millions of twinkling lights is breathtaking. I tried to take pictures (not so easy from a very fast moving car!) but no picture will do that view justice - it's one of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen.

Juhu beach
I have now been in Mumbai two weeks and feel it is time to start writing my blog. The main reason I have not written here earlier is because I have felt too overwhelmed by this incredible city to even begin to describe it, however I will now try as best I can. My first few days in Mumbai were overwhelming to say the least and now seem a bit of a blur. This place is so different to anywhere I have been before.

As I stepped out of the airport the two main things that hit me were the heat (obviously!) and the noise of hundreds of car engines and horns- at first I thought that this raucous must have meant that there was some sort of accident or demonstration happening, I now realise that this is the norm here pretty much anytime and anywhere in the city. On the drive from the airport to my apartment I began to realise why it's so noisy here. The traffic is absolutely crazy! Cars, lorries, rickshaws and bikes all swerving around each other at scary speeds, with very little attention being paid to lanes or traffic lights. The drivers use their
Juhu beach
horns all the time and while initially I found this intimidating and aggressive, I quickly realised that beeping is a necessity here and a way of warning other drivers that they are there. Another thing that struck me on that first car journey was seeing the poverty. I have always been aware that it's a huge problem here, you see pictures in the news and I've heard heart breaking stories from friends who have been here before but none of this prepared me for actually seeing it first hand. Children walking around in traffic jams begging for money, rows of families sleeping at the edges of main roads with nothing to use for shelter. It's shocking and upsetting to see.

My apartment is in a part of Mumbai called Andheri, which is very close to the sea, it has lots of high rise apartment blocks, shops and restaurants, but also has lots of trees and greenery. The apartment itself is bright, air conditioned with WiFi - everything you need really - and I am living here with other girls who are doing the same contract as me. Being the 'new girl', I am following their lead and quickly learning
Driving around Andheri
the way things work here.

For anything to do with work we travel in a big air conditioned car. Being chauffeured to and from rehearsals and shoots by our wonderful driver, Ali, I have spent most of these journeys gazing out of the window in complete awe of my surroundings. Endless rows of stalls selling all kinds of fruits and vegetables and strings of beautiful flowers; huge, gleaming hotels and shopping malls towering above thousands of tarpaulin shacks; massive billboards advertising the latest Bollywood films and a sea of yellow and black rickshaws, cars and buses. It's a chaotic place, full of character and constant hustle and bustle everywhere you look. Pictures to follow!

Promiscuos Bin!
Once we had finished our tour of the caves in the Aurangabad area, it was time to head back to Mumbai. We don’t normally like to head back to somewhere we have already been, however the trains heading into and out of Mumbai were more frequent and therefore it just made more logistical sense to do it this way.

Our train into Mumbai would take us back to good old CST where we first entered Mumbai on the previous journey, so at least we knew our way round and where to get ourselves in a Pre-paid Taxi. Last time we did this we got charged well over the odds to drive us round the corner, so we were prepared for a hefty fare as this time we were heading north close to Mumbai Central train station where our train would depart from the following evening heading North to Jaipur.


We agreed what seemed a fair price and were suddenly thrust back into the streets of Mumbai heading towards our slightly over budget digs for the night. Being a Sunday, Mumbai was again fairly quiet in regards to traffic, so we were zipping through narrow streets, unfinished highways and
One of the more random things we have found in our hotel wardrobe
poorly paved roads with a real sense of speed as we left the area of Fort in the South of Mumbai.


It was around an hour later when we started to wonder why this journey was taking so long. We knew Mumbai was a large place, however on the map, it seemed Central was only 10km or so from CST, and even on these roads, an hour without any real traffic seemed excessive? So, that was when I started to look for landmarks out of the window. The first thing that caught my eye was a train station named Kurla….. Knowing I had seen this station on the map before, I riffled through the Lonely Planet to see where this was on the map…….Oh dear.


It was at least 10km – 15km North of Central, where we needed to be. This was not good.


My first thought I’m ashamed to say was that the taxi driver knew exactly what he was doing and was purposely taking us way out of our way so that once we arrived at our unwanted destination, he would ask us for more money to take us to the correct
Seemed like a nice place until we read the last 'benefit'
destination…..this is something we have experienced before so it wasn’t completely out of the question. The second possibility was that the map on the internet site we booked the hotel with was wrong, and therefore the address we was heading to was correct, but nowhere near where we needed to be. There was a final possibility where the driver was going to take us to some caged den and torture us for giggles, however this seemed the most unlikely of the three to be honest.


After around an hour and 15 mins, the driver started to ask around the locals as to where the hotel was as he was having difficulty finding it….. to me, this was all a ruse and part of the act before he asked for more money, however the locals all seemed to be pointing further North like they knew the place. This could be seen as a good sign, however experience has proven that the people of India would rather tell you a direction, any direction, even if they don’t know where something is. It seems saying, ‘I really don’t know I’m afraid’ isn’t in their vocabulary, and therefore for all we knew,
Apparently it's OK to write over peoples clothes when youve put them in the wash...
they had less of an idea to the whereabouts of this hotel than us!


Then, all of a sudden, there it was, our hotel. The taxi driver had finally found it, and my first feeling was of guilt that I had doubted him in the first place.


After further examination, when we checked into our room, it was indeed the internet’s map that was bogus, and rather than show us the correct location, we were thrown an hour in the wrong direction with nothing around us but residential homes and a few closed shops. Brilliant!

It turned out that the hotel itself was actually very nice and the staff were fantastic. When we tried to do something simple like order a take-away Domino’s pizza (not very authentic Indian I know) it was like something out of a comedy sketch! It never ceases to amaze me how something so simple can be such a challenge here!

So, after a nice stay albeit in the completely wrong area, the next day we hailed a cab to take us all the way back to Mumbai Central station…on a Monday, in traffic. Another hour and 20 mins later,
Upgrade on the train!
we arrived in time for our train, and put the whole episode down to another random experience in India.

Boarding out train to Jaipur, we sat down and both sighed in relief. We were on our way now, and back in the game. When the ticket inspector asked for our tickets however, he had a look of confusion on his face….this is never good. Flicking between one page and another it seemed he couldn’t find us on his list…just what we needed. It was then he spoke for the first time and said ‘these are not your seats’ confused and worried, we double checked that we were in the right seats, and everything seemed to be fine? He then spoke for a second time and said ‘you have been upgraded, you need to go to carriage A1……’

Finally, in all the years of travel, a free upgrade, and we didn’t even have to ask. The hotel fiasco was quickly behind us, as we took to our comfy upgraded beds and fell into a deep uninterrupted sleep…..

August 24th 2013

Remind you of anything...
After such a long but amazing day in Ellora, we decided to take a day off from the cave sights and so instead had a lay in, chilled out and decided on going to see Bibi-qa-Maqbara 20 minutes down the road from where we were staying in Aurangabad. Bibi-qa-Maqbara is actually more commonly known as ‘The Mini Taj Mahal’, or the ‘Poor Mans Taj’ The reason for these nicknames is fairly simple in that this mausoleum built just after the original is a smaller less grand version of the Taj Mahal but bears a striking resemblance to it never the less.



Having yet to go to Uttar Pradesh to see the actual Taj Mahal, we thought this would be a great way to spend an hour or so looking around this smaller scaled copy to eventually be able to see how it compared to the original. Once in the gates, we were amazed at how much this did look like the Taj Mahal. Of course we were basing this on pictures we have seen of the Taj, however there is no doubt this was intended to look exactly like it. As you start to get closer you can
Steps leading to Mausoleum
clearly see some wear and tear in the building and it’s obvious that not too much love and attention is paid to this slowly dilapidating site. The water fountains and water pool that reflects the Taj so perfectly is a sad non-functioning pit with a few puddles, and the symmetrical trees that draw your eye towards the Taj here are a couple of badly trimmed scrubs that are on the verge of dying. The plaster is also starting to peel and fall off of some of the pillars that surround the main domed building therefore giving it a tired and weathered look.



Despite all this though, and considering it is well over 400 years old, it’s actually a fantastic site to come and visit. Of course there will be comparisons with the original, and of course this much smaller and less revered version will always, always be second best, but in spite of this it is still a fantastic sight, and considering this is a mausoleum for just one woman, it’s pretty impressive to say the least.

The following day, we were ready to see some more caves, and so headed out 100km towards Ajanta. We
Looking at the caves of Ajanta
read that these caves were older than the ones we had seen in Ellora, and if they had to pick one Ellora would win hands down. Undeterred by this, and despite the torrential downpour along the appallingly maintained main highway to Ajanta we were ready to make our own minds up to which we preferred.

Arriving in Ajanta, we climbed the steps up to the top of the hill and were greeted with quite a sight once at the summit. The caves of Ajanta are carved into a U shaped gorge with a river running underneath, and it really is quite spectacular. Even with the rain pouring down, we couldn’t help but stand and admire the view of this incredible place.

With only 30 caves here (some of which are closed), there was less than Ellora, but there was still plenty of exploring to be done. We decided to head for cave number 30 at the end of the trail, bypassing the other caves so we could enter each of them on the way back.

Again, without bogging you down with facts and figures, or trying to somehow describe the intricate details of the caves, all I
Beautiful cave
can say is wow! Some of these caves were just truly beyond belief in the way they had survived over the centuries leaving behind some real masterpieces in both carvings of Buddha’s, Bodhisattva’s and amorous couples as well as some incredible paintings. The paintings are particularly interesting in some of the caves, due to both their detail and the fact that they are still around today. For the second time in three days, Donna and I were again, truly blown away by these caves.



Being that it was a Saturday, we were a little worried that this place would be bombarded with hundreds of other tourists taking away the calm and serenity in each of the caves. Fortunately though, we always seemed just one step ahead of the hordes of people and just as we were leaving an empty cave (bar the two of us), a bunch of 30 tourists would clamber over each other to get in, shout for a while whilst occasionally glancing a look at masterpieces before moving onto the next cave. At one point a guy stopped us to tell us he was Indian several times (we had kind of gathered this already)
Amazing painting
and then ranting about something in Hindi. As we walked off, a guard told us that he was a ‘bad man’, ‘a drinking man’….. seems India has their share of drunk twats too.

So, after another great day of some spectacular sights, were again bound for Aurangabad. The 100km journey would take us around 2 and a half hours due to the pothole dodging, car/truck weaving ride in the rain, and every time we get in a car here, we are shocked at some of the things you see on these roads. Thankfully this journey would only provide a few heart pumping moments for us, but we did notice a burnt-out petrol tanker that wasn’t there on the way in that morning, and was glad we wasn’t around for that disaster. Our driver put it quite poetically in his broken English when after passing this truck he turned back to us, laughed and said ‘finished’. Yes, I guess that’s one way of putting it….

August 22nd 2013

Tiger Print window seat...Grrr
Arriving to our hotel in Aurangabad, Donna and I were surprised. Actually, we were surprised by a number of things. Firstly, the hotel room was as nice as the website pictures….surprise number 1. We were also surprised by the faux tiger print window seating that we had which would have been a great perk had the views not been of the shabby hotel next door and various other roofs of our neighbours. But the biggest surprise of the lot was the gecko that scurried out of my day bag over my shoulder and onto our bed. I confess that letting out a small and girly scream was my first reaction to this, but put this down to surprise rather than actual terror…..

If you have ever tried to catch a gecko, you will know that this is no easy task. They are quick, have unbelievable reactions and don’t really want to be caught. Our little friend however was slightly different. I think due to the long trip this little creature endured in my dark bag may have slowed him down a little however and this led to it only taking 40 minutes and a couple more yelps from us both
Admiring the view
in order to lure him into our trap of a jug covered with another jug. As I released him to the wild outside, I have to admit to being a little sweaty and more than a tad relieved that Donna would be the only one sharing my bed this evening.

So, Aurangabad. We were here as it is a great jumping off point for the famous Ellora and Ajanta caves that are 30km and 100km respectively from this city in Maharashtra. The day atfter we arrived, we had decided to go see the caves of Ellora and so ordered a taxi from the hotel to take us there and wait in order to bring us back once we were done.



The journey to Ellora from Aurangabad is quite a scenic one once you get out from the city, and as we have noticed a fair bit throughout our time in India, the landscape here is often stunning. Once there, we bypassed all the guides and touts and began exploring the first of the 34 caves that were in Ellora. Rather than bore you with a heap of facts and figures, all I will say is that
My Brekkie, a little bigger thn Donna's!
of these 34 caves, 12 of them are Buddhist, 17 Hindu and 5 are Jain, all of which were built from around 600AD to 1000AD. Amazingly, these caves were hand chiselled by thousands of labourers from top to bottom, carving the intricacies of the caves pillars and sculptures as they went. It really was quite remarkable. At times both Donna and I were literally blown away by some of the works detail, and how it could have survived this length of time.

Mid-way through our tour of Ellora, we decided to sit down for a rest before tacking the second half of the site. Having sat down on a bench not far from the entrance, we soon had company when a middle aged man sat to our left, lighting up a cigarette. On the other side, not much after, a lady of similar age to the gentleman sat to our right. Shortly after sitting down, the guy asked us if it was OK to talk to us, and did we mind being disturbed. He seemed like a nice guy and not after anything from us, so we happily chatted to this fella about India and their history. We also
Boob Grope!
discussed where he was from and where we were travelling to as well as listening to him talk fondly of his two daughters. He really was a delight to chat to and after recommending a few books to us, he stubbed out his cigarette and was off again to explore the caves. Then there was the woman to our right…. Not long after she sat down, legs a kimbo, she let out a truly horrendous squeaker of a fart, which prompted Donna and I to look at each other to confirm that this was indeed what we thought it was. With confirmation of a head nod from us both, we started to giggle like school kids on a field trip hoping the ‘lady’ didn’t twig what we were laughing at. It seemed this was fruitless however as not long after the guff came not one but two huge post food burps that sent Donna and I over the edge in fits of laughter. Sneaking a look at the woman after having produced this trio of gas leaks I assumed there could be nothing but horror and embarrassment on her face, maybe even shame. O my shock however, neither of these
Above Kailasa Temple
seemed to show on her face, as she nonchalantly carried on picking at her teeth as if nothing had happened. Sometimes, it’s hard to describe India and how in one instance you love the place but a second later you are cursing it. I think it these two people sum India up perfectly!

Our second stint looking round the caves of Ellora providing more gob-smacking wow moments from us, and no more so than the ‘piers de la resistance’ being cave number 16. This was the largest of the structures here at Ellora and is described in the Lonely planet and as ‘in-between a rock and a temple’ which I think sums it up quite well. In keeping with the other caves, this was made very much the same way from carving out 200,000 tonnes of rock, carefully leaving behind the sections that would be used for carving and sculpting. I’m not sure if my anaelogy crossed LP’s helps you picture what this is like, but all I can say is that it really is quite some feat, and the result is simply breath-taking.



For anyone who is in India and is debating whether this is
Inside Chaiya
worth going out the way for, then I can only strongly recommend that you make time for this wonderful site. It really is something else.

Upon leaving Ellora for the day, Donna and I found out whats its like to be famous. Firstly a family with a small child wanted their picture taken with us as we made our way to the exit. Nothing new here, being in random pictures is pretty standard here and something you kind of get used to. This however got a little bit silly, and after the first one was posed for, there was another, and then another until it really did start to seem like we were getting ‘papped’. I even found myself saying ‘Sorry guys, no more please’ like I was some sort of Rock N Roll god and instantly tfelt like a complete dick for saying these words, however they were actually required!! We headed to the saftey of the bar for a cool beer to seal the day off and get away from the photo hunters and toasted a good days sighseeing. Upon leaving the bar a good half an hour later, the same guy I had just ‘turned down’
Posing for snaps
for a photo was in the same spot waiting for us and pleaded for just one photo. I put my arm around him, smiled and said ‘OK, just one though’ now fully committed to the life style of a famous icon.



New found fame aside, we both really enjoyed Ellora and were truly amazed at some of the sites it had to offer. If Ajanta, our second set of caves, was anything like what we had seen here, we were in for a treat…..

<strong data-blogger-escaped-style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">SHIMLA - KANDAGHAT - MANALI - DHARAMSHALA

One week before leaving, and I’m super excited, really looking forward to a beautiful trip.

We are flying to Chandigarh and from there we have hired a car for the full journey, so we have the options of doing & taking things our way i.e., taking pictures on the way, being comfortable and drinking in the views.

We are going to stay in Club Mahindra all throughout the trip so we don’t have to spend on stay.

Hey! Himachal Pradesh here I come.

<strong data-blogger-escaped-style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">CHANDIGARH<strong data-blogger-escaped-style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">:

We land in Chandigarh and since it’s on the way we go to the Pinjore Gardens.

The Pinjore garden has beautiful fountains. On the day we go it also has colorful umbrellas for decoration.



<strong data-blogger-escaped-style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">HIMACHAL PRADESH:-

As we enter the hills we see cottony clouds hanging on mountains. The temperatures start dropping, & it becomes cool & pleasant.

Since we are travelling in the monsoons there’s water and greenery everywhere. It’s not too hot or too cold, just pleasant!



<strong data-blogger-escaped-style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">SHIMLA:

We are welcomed at Club Mahindra, Mashobra in the evening.

Next day we start with a horse ride at Naldhehra. It’s my first time on a horse.

Here the guide shows us places where shootings have happened. Then we see the golf course and finally a point from where we can see the nearby village, its foggy otherwise apparently the china border can also be seen from that point.

Kufri-(did not like the horse ride though a sea of mud). We only see the nag temple. The nag temple is at a height.

Jakhoo Temple- the Jakhoo temple is on mall road. We walk it up, taking in the scenery. It is a long steep walk but totally worth it. There is a huge Hanuman Statue on the top. The hanuman temple itself is great. It has a garden with flowers, it’s clean and it has the most amazing view. You can see entire Shimla from there. You just feel in touch with god & nature. It is surrounded by tall trees on all side & Lots of mischievous monkeys playing around.

<strong data-blogger-escaped-style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">KANDAGHAT:

Kandaghat Mahindra resorts The Destination. It’s amongst the mountains.

We spend the evening in a garden where we hear the sounds of only the bird’s chirping.An apple Tree and complete Silence except for the birds. The day ends with a red sunset, & the fountain entertaining us.

The clear sky gives us a view of the innumerable stars. Since the resort is situated far away from anything like a city, once it become dark , its pitch dark- the night is lit with only the light of the stars and the resort lamps.

The resort has kept the nature intact.

<strong data-blogger-escaped-style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">MANALI:

On the way to Manali we travel along with the river Beas .We also see the prayag of parvati & beas.

In manali we see plenty of apple orchards with little green apples hanging on trees .Club Mahindra is surrounded by them.



We start early for the Rotang Pass. Every day it breaks down due to landslides and is remade again. Infact when we are travelling I do see work going on, on the road.

Rotang pass leads to leh ladakh.

The drive to Rotang pass is scary but once you go up you find a beautiful mountainous world. Rotang pass is about snow peaked mountains, Plenty of glaciers and wild flowers. We spotted cows; sheep’s & horses grazing (Also one yak) and a lone vulture flying in the sky. There are a few breathtaking waterfalls on the way .The waterfalls in terms of length are big. The waterfalls are actually streams or tributaries falling over cliffs or heights.

We spot the beas nala (it’s a waterfall) where apparently they sat and wrote the Mahabharat. I wonder how a story of so much loss and destruction is written in such serene a place.

The stones on rotang pass glitter and shine in the sun. I can almost imagine picking them up & making jewelry out of it.

In rotang pass we choose a glacier to play with the snow. You can also do skiing on the snow.

We also hear about a rani who came to attack the kulu raja but died when the glacier broke and her army died along with her.

After Rotang pass we go for a gondola ride in solang valley. The area also offers other adventure sports like zorbing, ATV, Paragliding etc.



We see the ancient Vashist temple, which is made out of wood & stone (definitely looks ancient!). It has kunds adjoining the temple. kunds are made of warm water springs. We also see a fish spa for the feet in a nearby area (though I don’t try it).



Next we see the hidimba temple which is surrounded by tall deodars. Hidimba is a rakshasha & wife of Bhim .They had a son - ghatotkatcha .

The way towards the temple has blue flowers.

The wooden hidimba temple is decorated with animal skulls. The deity is located in a cave sorts within the temple.

Near to the hidimba temple is a prayer place for ghatotkacha. It’s a tree with the deity under it (open air temple).

Once we come out of the temple there are women following us with lambs, yaks and rabbits. You can click a picture with them for money. Not to mention the people persuading us for photos in Kashmiri clothes. Ultimately I fall for the white lamb and a cute white rabbit. The rabbit I chose was cuter than a soft toy (really!!!).

We proceed to mall road:

1) Tibetan temple - Like all other Tibetan temples it is colorful and clean. A monk was chanting prayers inside. We circle the temple turning the prayer wheels. Outside the temple I have yummy veg momos.

2) We shop on mall road for salwar suits and fruit barfi.

The next day we head to manikaran. Before that we go to nagar castle. This happens to be an old castle with a brief history. Many movies including jab we met have been shot here. It has a small temple inside. But the best part of this place is the restaurant. The view makes the delicious food more delicious. Since the castle / place is situated at a height the view is unbeatable. Since a few tables are put up in the balcony, these give an open air feel though there is a roof.



Enroute to manikaran the driver talks about magic, herbs, trees, babas etc.

He tells us about a plant which bears bluish color flowers which he says can never be plucked. A person who manages to pluck it will become immensely wealthy. He says he tried once when he spotted the flower, but when he climbed the tree it had vanished.

Manikaran-

We go into the hot cave first. As I remove my sandal to get into it, I wear it again immediately. The floor even outside the cave is hot.

As I go in, I start perspiring because it’s hot. There are three caves and the outermost cave has rocks. I see people leaning on them.im told since they are hot they cure joint pains / bone pains. We pray at the gurudwara. The bath is closed so we head for shiv temple.

The history of this temple goes that the goddess parvati lost her earring i.e., chintamani. The mother earth could not hold this jewel and it landed in patal lok with sheshnaag. Since it could not be found, lord shiva opened his third eye. sheshnaag sent back the jewel with a hiss along with many other jewels. It is believed the water made jewels appear till the earthquake of 1905.

The shiv temple has two hot springs, shallow well sorts, with hot water bubbling out. Just a touch of a second and your hand burns. There is a vendor selling rice n chana which you can put into it and make Prasad yourself. I buy a can and fill up the hot spring water which smells like sulphur.

We pray in the temple. The river parvati, full of rapids, is flowing in the backside of the shiv temple.

Next we go to the ram temple. The kund there is open. I wash my arms, feet and face with the warm water. I feel fresh immediately. Lastly we pray there.

We buy various types of fruits. The fruit seller has apples, plums & many fruits in the family of plum (one of them he calls rasmalai), almonds, pears, small peaches, cherries, mangoes.

We stay at mandi .The only non-club Mahindra night to cut down on travelling.



<strong data-blogger-escaped-style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">DHARAMSHALA:

We go to Dharamshala.

On the way we see Baijnath temple. It’s an old stone temple of shiv with carvings all over. This temple is one of the jyotirlingas in the country.

Next day we go to Bhagsunath temple. The temple has a waterfall about 2 km away from it. The waterfall has clear water. The walk to the waterfall is like a mini trek.

We see himachal’s own small dal lake.

Then Mcleodganj, the place where DalaiLama resides (we are not lucky enough to see him). It has a monastery. It is an area of Tibetan’s (thousands of Tibetan’s moved out of Tibet with the DalaiLama), so around the temple you will find a market with Tibetan cuisine and Tibetan jewelry sellers. I pick up a Tibetan book from the Tibetan bookstore at the monastery which is about their local folk tales.

Dharamshala Cricket stadium - We were allowed inside to have a look & though I’m not a cricket fan I find the stadium superb and impressive. Wow!! Cricket in a place like this? (hmmm. I have to watch a match played at dharamshala).

Chamundadevi temple: I mainly go there because it is a shaktipeeth. A shaktipeeth is where the organs of the goddess sati fell. They are scattered all over asia. Lord shiv’s consort sati went to the yajna organized by her father against the willingness of lord shiv. Then her father insulted lord shiv which she was unable to bear and jumped into the yajna. Lord shiv ran through the three worlds carrying her on his shoulders, and wherever her organ fell a shaktipeeth arose. Parvati is the incarnation of sati/shakti. The goddess kali is worshipped here. There is a small lake / kund where boating is possible.

Dharamshala club Mahindra is probably smaller but offers a unique experience. We go to the restaurant, meet the chef personally, who even makes us a dish which is not on the menu, on request.

It is located in the middle, in terms of sightseeing places.

On our last night there we even experience an earthquake of the magnitude 5.1.

Our last sightseeing is the Jwalamukhi temple .It is another shaktipeeth.it is here that goddess sati’s burning tongue fell. But the wonder of this place is the natural blue flames coming out at various places inside the temple (thus the temple is jwalamukhi).

On the way to the airport we see the nangal dam of the bhakra nangaldams .Its canals carry turquoise colored waters of the river Sutlej.

My trip ends with a wish for the next one to be just as good.

Near Ozar
Finally, this was the one outing that makes me come back to the the blog after almost 4 years! I saw people comparing this place with some other places and calling it mini-swiss, but ask me, it's just our own India and I am proud of it - the serene beauty of Maharashtra, the ranges of Sanhyadri, favorite among the trekkers, known for the fog covered mountains, having several valleys and forts!

So, how did I landed there? I wanted to take my family out, especially had not taken my daughter anywhere in this monsoon, wanted to take her close to waterfalls, dams - now that she has started understanding what they mean! I was on search for something which is little different than regulars like Lonavala, Tamhini, Matheran and even the forts and I finally found ""Bhandardara"". The dam looked really beautiful in pics posted on internet, but only dam...no...i was looking for more. Little more time on search took me to ""Amruteshwar"" temple at ""Ratanwadi"". Yeah, those who have done that famous ""Ratangad"" trek, will now understand what I am going to say, the beauty that is beyond explanation and I am sure, they will also remember their
Around the farms
own visits to this place! There can be yet others who would know this place and they will be the people who have visited ""Sandhan valley"" at Samrad.

So what all to see? those who like, untouched villages, unending greenery, thick jungles, complete peace and fresh air with 100% Oxygen, the drive through those tiny roads that takes you to this place offer all once you start approaching Ozar (Ashtavinayak Ganapati), yeah I took the not-recommended road, and the road didn't disappoint me even for a moment. Here is the route Narayangon->Ozar->Otur->Bramhanwada-> Kotul->Bhandardara->Ratanwadi.

Ozar has a beautiful Ganesh temple, which you get to see immediately after you cross the bridge. The water on the either sides of bridge and tall buildings standing at one side of the river, will not let you go without clicking some snaps at this place. Reaching temple, one can also opt for boating after reaching temple.

Ozar-Otur, took us through the green farms on either sides of the road, all that our sight was able to capture was either sugarcane or banana farms spread wide until they were stopped by the ranges of Sanhyandri to enhance the beauty further, luckily the clear
Water - water - everywhere
sky was making the whole scene more beautiful.

Otur-Bhandardara -the drive through the ghats, thick jungles in some patches on either sides, and the other patches with lonely homes in those green belts, made us wonder how those families be staying-all alone. Yeah, we didn't find crowd at any of these places and that continuously kept me pleased!

Before we reached Bhandardara, we saw yet another dam, the sun-rays made the water flowing out of dam look silvery and more beautiful, we skipped a close visit to this one! Then came ""Randha waterfalls"" and this was the first place on our journey where we saw a lots of people, some tents offering eatables, garam Chai Bhajji and Maggie! As we were admiring several waterfalls at this place the rain started and then never stopped for us till we started our journey back from Ratanwadi.

Bhandardara-has a huge dam and those lots of people had come to see this dam. The dam's doors were open, as if inviting water to show it's power and you know the water, if anyone even dares to come close to it! We decided to move on from here quickly as my goal
@Randha falls
was to enter inside the forest - ""Abhayaranya"".

After paying the entry fee for Abhayaranaya, we kept driving till Amruteshwar temple. The rain wasn't stopping for a moment after we entered the Abhayarana. The views here are just breathtaking, the views kept me distracting all the time. On the right hand side, we were seeing the backwaters of Bhandardara dam, the clean blue water, spread till our eye sight can see, interrupted by mountains at several places, and on the left side, the small and big waterfalls, as many as we could see from our car's windows. As per locals and authorities at the entry, this drive is a 60 kms drive and ends at a village called Shendi. On route there is ""Amruteshwar temple - 1000 year old Shiva temple"" at Ratanwadi, also the base camp for Ratangad trek, Ghatghar and Samrad - the entry point for Sandhan Valley trek.

We drove till Amruteshwar and decided to return back from there. Though the road is in a very bad shape, we enjoyed the drive, and this 20 kms patch till the temple is worth exploration. As we were driving , we were climbing up the hill, we
Amruteshwar Temple @ Ratanwadi
were taken away from the backwaters only to be treated with more picturesque views, the full blown waterfalls originating from the left side and descending on to the right side through those lonely villages, wide spread farms! Rare sighting of humans and the cars and the drive so amazing that we just passed enjoying it forgetting about taking any efforts for taking pictures.

We finally reached Amruteshwar, just stood amazed after we got down the car after we looked at all four sides around us. I think, it can only be experienced and is beyond description, so let me just leave it with that note. We entered inside the temple, the Shivlinga was almost gone under the water, the pandits there told us that they water level will reduce in October, however some part of the Shivlinga is always inside the water , we offered our prayers, spend some time around the temple and decided to start our return journey. During our return journey, we halted at Ozar for Ganapati darshan and then came home non stop!

What a day and what drive! 7.30 AM we started from Pune and we were back home at 10.00 PM.

And yeah, don't forget to check the snaps at the bottom of the page!

Some tips: Carry your own food and plan the trip so that you can reach to the nearest city if you need to stay overnight unless you book at Bhandardara in advance.

Yogi Donna
I am going to live my life with Peace and Joy, as I am going to control my emotions. Now my life will be full and Joy and Peace, Forever – Yoga Nidra Resolve.



So, after our pampering at Beyond Wine resort, it was back to reality for a couple of days where we were held up in a hotel room somewhere close to Nasik town centre. The weather was miserable for our time there, so we pretty much just stayed in and vegged out whilst catching up on emails drinking coffee and eating. The reason for this massive waste of time was because the next venture, attending a Yoga health centre, was due to start in 2 days’ time and truth be told, we had nothing else better to do.

We had booked this course a few weeks ago after seeing a couple of forum posts about it, and decided that as we was going to be in Nasik, and we wanted to do some Yoga, why not? The cost was suspiciously cheap for 10 days full board, own room and the yoga, but we decided to take the plunge anyway.

The place
Looking down at the Yoga hall
itself actually turned out to be more of a Yoga medical centre than an Ashram which is what we were hoping for, however since the cost of their ashram was around twice as much as this we decided to give this a whirl and see what it entailed.



The centre itself is fairly basic, as are the rooms, but pretty much what we expected from the details of the course that were provided to us before we came. We were warned that this was not a luxury resort and that if that was what we were after, we should look elsewhere! After a consultation with the doctors on arrival and describing any medical problems that we had, we received a quick check-over and was then recommended certain treatments for our ailments. It transpired that along with the Yoga, we would also be able to receive various Ayurveda (ancient Indian herbal medicine) treatments which would work hand in hand with the Yoga we were doing in order to help heal us physically and mentally, and help us feel a whole lot better than when we turned up. Sounded just the ticket to try and sort out my on-going
Our Yoga instructor - 'The Guru'
stomach issues and Donna’s undulating high blood pressure.

The days would all be structured in pretty much the same way each day with a 6am start and 10pm bedtime. In between those times there would be a hive of activity including Asanas (Yoga Poses), Pranayama (Breathing techniques), Yoga Nidra (Meditation) and chanting, along with steam baths, massages, and herbal medicine drinks thrown in to ensure our health was at its physical peak.

The first couple of days were actually pretty tough going for us both. Donna was suffering from a really bad cold and couldn’t do much but snot, sneeze and sleep where as I was suffering on a mental level. Basically l was feeling a bit claustrophobic and anxious at being in this place for the foreseeable future and not having done anything like this before, I just couldn’t quite get used to the idea. It’s not like I couldn’t just walk out at any moment, I mean this is hardly a prison, but I just didn’t feel comfortable.



What didn’t help was the food. It turns out I get a bit grouchy when I don’t eat, or when the food I have put
Daily herbal drink
in front of me is something I’m just not over the moon on eating. Don’t get me wrong, I generally will eat most things and actually dislike very little, however for those first couple of days, it was like they knew exactly what I didn’t like, and were therefore purposely feeding me all those very things. I know I now come across as a spoilt arse in those last sentences, and I should appreciate that I actually have something to eat especially after seeing some of the poverty here in India, but, I am just telling you how I was feeling at the time. To be honest, I think Donna shared my dislike for the food just as much, but she tends to moan about food a lot less than I. Despite not loving the choice of food, we always finished what was in front of us whether it was raw veg, watery soup, gruel, semolina, or dreaded Papaya fruit. Firstly because it’s polite, but truth be told more so because in the back of our minds supressed way down, we know it’s good for us.



Having sampled various treatments such as cabbage steams, powdered medicine and
Daily stomach Mudpack
even Turmeric set alight and inhaled harder than a frat guy on a bong at spring break, Donna had finally beaten her cold. After having pulled myself together, I too was also starting to perk up after Day 3.



The Asanas and Pranayama were getting progressively more advanced each day and we really started to find ourselves relaxing into the meditation sessions. The food was still questionable, however we got over ourselves, put on a brave face for the doctor that insists on watching us eat every meal and got it down our gullets!

Mid-way through the time here, we were both really starting to enjoy ourselves and were actually feeling pretty good with all this yoga, chanting and healthy food. This surprised me a little as it was now a good few days since we had drank a coffee, a whole week since we had a beer and it’s these things that tend to make me a happy bunny, so I guess it was working.

A spanner was thrown in the works by Day 6 when we were told about the 3 day programme we were about to embark on. It involved a full
Saluting the indian flag for Independance Day
day of only fruit and veg (no big deal really), followed by a whole day with nothing but hot water with lemon (ah, not so good), finishing with a day of nothing but juices and liquids (after a day of only lemon water, not what you need!). In addition to this, on day 3 of 3, there would be no reading, and no talking from 5am until 5pm….. tough considering we would be stuck in our room for much of the day.



Both of us were up for the challenge though and if it gave our digestive systems a rest, helped us shed a couple of excess pounds and made us feel a tonne better afterwards, then we were game.

Somehow we managed to pull through the three days and somehow neither of us really felt weak or like we were about to pass out at any moment. This programme was one that we were told we could do at home every 15 days if we felt the need…. Can’t see us doing it too often truth be told (although Donna insists she wants to do this once a month when we return home), however if
Reading...
ever in need of a detox, say after Christmas etc, then it could be worth considering!

We were rewarded with a day out to visit the Ashram in the countryside and a visit to some temples, alongside some local guys from another of the centres the following day, these chaps were really friendly and helped explain some of what was going on in the temples as well as acting as ‘bodyguards’ keeping unwanted questions, stares and hassles at bay. It was great to get out of the centre for a day and see some sights we wouldn’t have seen if we had been organising this ourselves. The day was brought to a close with plenty of Namaste’s and handshake from our new Indian buddies along with the obligatory photos.

With only one more day left this pretty much rounded up our time here, and Donna and I were both happy to get back to the routine of Yoga, Pranayama and Meditation with our in-house Guru.

Our time spent here was one that was initially approached with hesitancy of the unknown. We certainly had our ups and downs in there throughout the time, whether it be due to
Donna 'Omkar chanting'
the food, the sometimes unreliable time schedule or the amazing benefits gained from the Asanas and Yoga Nidra along with meeting all the helpful staff around the place. All in though, both of us really enjoyed the experience and agreed that this would set us up nicely for our two weeks of intensive Yoga in Rishikesh in September at Parmarth Niketan Ashram on the banks of the River Ganges.

Leaving recharged, spiritually minded, calm and even a few pounds lighter, we felt ready to face India once more and were almost looking forward to the challenge.

Jumping in a rickshaw bound for our hotel for the night in Nasik feeling chipper and calm with the world, we were ripped off by a full 50R (about 60p) straight away by the driver…….I was FURIOUS.

Looks like it will take a few more sessions for me to fully ‘control my emotions, and live in Peace and Joy Forever’ although it was a start!

Entrance to Beyond..
“The discovery of a wine is of greater moment than the discovery of a constellation. The universe is too full of stars.” Benjamin Franklin

I’ll start by defending our massive disregard for the rules of the road whilst backpacking and hence why we chose to head off to the fantastic ‘Beyond@ Sula Vineyard’ resort in Nasik.

The main reason for this seemingly outrageous overspend was that it was Donna’s birthday and so we decided to treat ourselves. The second reason was the unbelievable package that we managed to snare because we were in the right place at the right time. Being Monsoon, I guess business is a little slow at this fantastic hotel and spa and so we managed to get a 2 night, 2 meal, 2 breakfast package which included a bottle of wine a 2 hour spa treatment and tour and tasting in the vineyard for a very agreeable price. Reason 3….….drinking wine has become a bit of a passion of ours and getting the chance to sample Indian wine is an experience we have yet to try, so we thought what the heck!

Having seen the pictures online for some of the hotels in India
Sula Hotel
and comparing them to reality can conjure up quite a shocking contrast, so we were wary all the way up to the gate of Beyond, hoping this wasn’t one of the 'it's way better in the pictures' types of places. Fortunately, as we pulled up to the entrance, we knew we had made a good decision.

With the look and feel of a 4/5 star place, and sipping our welcome drinks, we were relieved to say the least. Heading up and into our room ‘Cabernet’ this relief continued as this was by far the best room we had been in in quite some considerable time.

Our first day was spent chilling in the room with our bottle of Brut, enjoying the views from our balcony of the infinity pool and grape vines below us with nothing but the birds singing and the sound of the hotels various water fountains breaking the silence. We decided that as we had a free spa treatment included in the package, we should save this for day 2 and pay for one now, since the prices were reasonable, so we headed off in search of some much needed stress relief and soothing music.
Brut for two
It was just what the doctor ordered. The complimentary evening meal added to the relaxation factor for both of us as we ate so much that evening that both of us found it hard not to pass out there and then at the table. This meal coupled with the Brut and now the Sula Malbec -Merlot we had just consumed, we were pretty much done for the day!



The morning of the second day brought much of the same with the standard overkill on a buffet breakfast (why have just cereal when there’s eggs, nan, curry and various other treats that you can try) before nearly passing out from a food coma as we returned to the room. Today though we had plans and things to do…… sure, those things included a wine tour and tasting and another massage, however they were things to do all the same and sleep was therefore not an option.

The tour itself was actually fairly brief in comparison to others we have been to, however when it came to tasting the wine, we were pleasantly surprised with what India had to offer in the world of wine. Of the 6
Sunset
that we tried, there weren’t any that we disliked, and actually had we been able to ship over a case or two to the UK, we definitely would have sent some home. Unfortunately, I think due to the current laws and the fact that Sula is still a fairly small outfit in the whole scheme of things in the wine world, this was not an option. Instead though, we took a couple of the bottles that we really like away with us and stuffed them in the backpacks with hope that they last the next 4 months or so without breaking.

Our spa treatment following a few glasses of wine was as could be expected and we were about as relaxed as we have been for some time now.

Overall, we had a blast overindulging in food wine and relaxation, and if that makes us the worst backpackers in the world, then so be it. It was worth it!

Happy Birthday Donna x

Just a pinch of the rubbish by the railway tracks...
After our nice relaxing time in Goa, we were bracing ourselves for the worst as our next stop was one of the most populated cities on the planet…Mumbai.

Before arriving in India, we made a vow not to travel to any major cities if it was possible, and so far we had done quite well on this front. Unfortunately though, Mumbai is a gateway to so many places in India that it was pretty much unavoidable, and so we boarded the train and headed north.

We decided to treat ourselves on this leg of the trip, and so decided to upgrade from second class sleeper to the 3AC class. This would mean that rather than having to have the windows open for air and letting the stench of the stations waft in, we would instead have AirCon which we assumed would definitely be worth the extra 10 quid or so….It was.

We arrived in Mumbai at around half 6 in the morning, having had a decent sleep and didn’t even stir when everyone else left the train after arriving. Getting off the train, we had to make sure that we was actually where we were supposed to be,
Old School Taxi
as having read the description of this famous CST building, this didn’t seem quite right? Where was the amazing architecture of the place, and where on earth could they have filmed the end dance seen in Slumdog millionaire…not here surely, it just looked like every other station we had been to and didn’t really seem that big? Having walked along the platform to the main concourse, we confirmed that this was the right place, as there were people everywhere and the station suddenly opened right up.

Batting off a few taxi touts on our way to the pre-paid taxi line outside the station, we were charged what seemed to be a reasonable 150R (About £1.75) to get to our hotel and so off we went with our driver. Driving out of the station threw up a healthy combination of day tripping families, businessmen and travellers mixed with waifs, beggars and people that called the station there home. Turning right out of the station and less than a minute into the journey, our driver pulled up towards the pavement and came to a stop. Nothing unusual there, perhaps he was going to buy his breakfast, chat to a friend or
Crazy Street of Mumbai
top up his phone or something (all of these have happened on our travels so far). This time though, it was different. He didn’t stop to do any of these things as he got out and opened Donna’s door. Confused, Donna and I looked at each other and said ‘Aye?’

The driver gestured over to a building behind him and said the words ‘Hotel Victoria’. Now, we knew straight away that this was either some scam or that he had the wrong place. Firstly, we knew the hotel was on this road, however we were pretty sure it wasn’t this close to the station…..you could still see the station in the wing mirrors! Also, there was no way this could be our hotel as we had seen it on the internet and this was not what it looked like. Sceptical, we assured the driver this was not our hotel and asked that he take us to the correct one….Hotel Victoria. He was insistent, and pointed to the sign above the dark, dingy door which did, to be fair state that this was Hotel Victoria, and that the address was what we had written down. After getting out and checking
Taj Hotel
the address for ourselves, his logic was faultless and so we had to investigate further by going in and proving him wrong as we wouldn’t have a booking here……. We did. It was there in black and white, our internet reservation to this shockingly dark hotel, a stone’s throw from the station. We had been knocked twice in the matter of seconds – once by the cab that could easily have told us the hotel was a 2 minute walk and by the amazing website that convinced us that this hotel was top notch when in fact, it was anything but. To be honest, if I could find the person that took the pictures of the hotel as well as the person who made that website, I would shake their hands and congratulate them on a job well done. We couldn’t even be annoyed to be honest, they were geniuses!

So, after settling into our hotel (the room itself was actually sort of OK) we tried to sort out what to do with our two days here. It mainly consisted of walking around the city, taking in Mumbai’s numerous amazing buildings, in-between eating and drinking.

Walking round Mumbai
Fort area, Mumbai
was a little surreal on the first day. We expected it to be crazy, busy, and complete chaos; however none of this was anywhere to be seen. Some parts were actually even a little too quiet, and we wondered if we had gone the wrong way or something. Then it dawned on us….it was Sunday. This had to be the reason.

Turns out, that was the reason! Monday morning brought a whole new meaning to the word busy. Stepping out of the hotel, we were met with cars, rickshaws, people, bikes, smoke, smells and heat all at once. This was more like it! We actually even enjoyed it too. We didn’t expect to, however the fact that everyone let you get on with what you were doing and left you alone just meant you could either walk in amongst it or just sit back and watch Mumbai do its thing…which is pretty amazing!

Whilst in Mumbai it would be Donna's official Birthday. We hadn't made any plans whilst here to do anything for the special day as we had booked something for a few days time, and so that would be faux Birthday that we would instead celebrate.
B'day beers in Cafe Universal
We did however manage to find a bar that wasn't too dark or full of men, and order ourselves a couple of cold ones to toast the occasion. At £2 for a large beer, we were paying well over the norm, however I unselfishly let that slide for the Birthday girl.....😉

One of the things we liked most about Mumbai was the great blend of old and new. There is everything there from old school market places and street vendors to uber cool cafes and bars. The architecture was also something we loved. This varied massively as you wandered around and it has everything from tenement blocks that are on the verge of collapse to beautiful neo-gothic buildings that are stunning. The buildings we loved most though as always were in the style of Art deco. Some of these old or new, were just amazing.

Apart from the buildings though, Mumbai threw up plenty more interesting things for us to ponder and witness. It seemed everywhere we looked there was something strange or unusual going on. Bicycle powered sharpening contraptions; barbers or the side of the street, and even a market stall selling vibrators are all just standard
Great little Cafe
things in the street here. It really was a feast for the eyes and ears. Sadly though, all too often you were pulled straight back to the reality of this place witnessing the extreme poverty that is so real here. I don’t think we will ever forget some of the sad things we have seen here from babies crawling through the rubbish to a guy with a severed foot covered in flies just sitting on the street seemingly waiting for the end. It really is a real rollercoaster ride coming to this place, and you certainly go through numerous emotions whilst here. We were glad we came in the end, and overall, we actually really enjoyed our time that we spent here.

Yet another surprise thrown up by this incredible place. What’s next India??!!

amby-valley, the lake and bridge
The year 2000 December I landed in Mumbai weighing all of 36 kilos, exhausted and stressed with Kolkata. I managed to find a paying guest accommodation in Bandra and then a job developing business for a medical import and export organization. The next year in February we drove down to Pune for some meetings with doctors. I remember being very impressed with the expressway and it was a lovely drive round the Ghat section of the Western Ghats. A couple of meetings, a quick lunch and a visit to Jehangir hospital and we drove back. A very exhausted me almost went off to sleep during the drive before being deposited near my paying guest accommodation. I believe the expressway is far more advanced now and Pune has developed into a hub. I do wish to go there once again since my sister-in-law lives there with her family and so does my uncle and aunt and various distant relatives.

Many years later we drove down to Aamby Valley, a luxury residential resort built and managed by the Sahara Group. This was a company outbound on behalf of the division I worked in and we stopped for a comfort break on the
Aamby Valley Cottages
way. There was a neat box of breakfast kept on our seats and we checked into our rooms and proceeded to the conference hall for a round of marketing chit chat and motivating round of exercises. One of them was walking on broken pieces of glass and I am so scared of broken glass and burning charcoal but i did it. It is a memory I cherish till date. After lunch we rested a bit and met up in the evening for drinks and a party. They have these beautiful man made lakes, auditoriums, Swiss style chalets and tent cottages. There are golf courses and we all signed up for a massage. I opted for the Swedish one at the exotic spa and salon and it was so relaxing. In the evening I remember being quite drunk and conking out on my bed. Some team members opted for golf lessons, some for swimming and there were lovely sit outs by the lake and walks one could take around the property. A hearty breakfast followed the next morning and we tried some water sports. The banana boat and speedboat is something I can remember now. Being dunked in the pond and
mall at koregaon park
then discovering that we won't drown was exhilarating. We also tried the wave pool and got buggies to take us from one part of the property to the other. One night coming home in the buggy in the hilly region in the month of January I felt the cold air chilling my bones. This was a really positive experience filled with games, parties, food and general bonding that can and does happen at a conference. The only sad memory was the personal life crisis I was being forced to face. But life is like that, it's yin and yang and the balance of negative and positive energies. People say rude things and then they say nice things, sometimes u rise in other people's eyes and sometimes you fall in your own. Life goes on and I shall move on to my next blog.

My second trip to Pune has been planned for February. Hubby is going to Delhi and I will not be accompanying him, so will be visiting common relatives in Pune,the same ones I mentioned in the beginning of the blog. I am flying Indigo on 7th and will return by the same airline on the 11th and hubby should be back on the 12th. I am excited about it as I am about all travel and look forward to all the changes that have come about in Pune since the beginning of 2001. Watch this space for more...I am slightly anxious about the thought of handling so many relatives but I take off bravely none the less. I leave home a bit early and after collecting my medical reports from Apollo I arrive at the airport by Olacabs and pay 767 as opposed to nine hundred and something which Meru would have charged me. I check in and proceed to collect a mango lassi, buy Mysore pak sweets from shoppers stop for my hosts and a Grisham for me. I land in Pune and collect my luggage and leave for my hosts home with my host. The next 4 nights and 5 days were spent mall hopping, catching sandwiches for lunch, browsing books at crossword and watching the morning show at Inox and Pvr. We saw two movies saving Mr. Banks and American hustle, realistic movies but not happy ones. So I cribbed about that. We ate at Bon south, food courts and baker street, we tried the sumptious food at German bakery and I used to help myself to lovely sandwiches and maska pav for breakfast from the Iranian bakery called diamond bakery. Also caught a couple of movies which were pre-recorded the queen, rear window and Rebecca. I enjoyed this experience much more. While browsing one of the self help books at crossword I came across 'you can if you think you can' by Norman Vincent Peale and it appealed to me so much I went back the next day and the day after my return buying some of his titles. I still have many more to buy. Now that's something to look forward to and keeps me motivated. Some relatives had to be tolerated unfortunately and some who's company I absolutely adored and over cups of tea we juggled memories and family photos. I am extremely impressed with the quality of malls and the real estate development. The roads are fine and places like German bakery are very cosmopolitan places to hang out in. Pune is green and clean and still developing, but how. I noticed devotees of Osho ashram in red robes in the vicinity of the ashram although I didn't get a chance to visit this time. A short flight and I was home to bland and nutritious home-cooked food. I wish I hadn't panicked so much at the very thought of relatives. One should make some compromises and then one can enjoy their company so much. Life's trials are so hard on us sometimes, we doubt so much and believe so little. I am now reading The Power of Positive Thinking which is helping me so much!

MUMBAI
GATEWAY OF INDIA
Water very murky as we sailed into port this morning - everyone warned not to swim in any of the beaches around Mumbai. Had a great day in Mumbai, we were very surprised, thought it would be a load more hectic that it was. Still loads of people and beeping horns of little black and yellow taxis everywhere - bit like Bali road rules are just guidelines - they basically do what they want to and go where they want to. Six of us hired a very comfortable, airconditioned people mover for $10 head for the day and that worked great! Took us to all the sites around Mumbai, including Dobi Ghat (the washing place), Ghandi House, Gateway of India, The Taj Mahal Hotel which looks very opulent directly opposite the Gateway of India, the beach areas - went to a couple of markets as well including the Thieves market and Crawford market. The aroma in the spice market was fabulous. It was hard to find anything we wanted to buy though - found a couple of tops and scarves. Of course our driver tried to take us to places where he would get a kick back but we soon put
MUMBAI
FRESH RAINWATER FOR SALE, YUKK!!
him straight - its our tour not your sightseeing tour!! Very humid and hot - rained a little in the afternoon as well - lucky with the weather - as its their monsoon season!!! We were warned of pick pockets but had no trouble at all. Our New South Wales buddies are a lot of fun and really nice people. Ship sailing 6.00p.m. on our way to Dubai.

We were only coming back to India as our return flight home was from Mumbai. We had just 4 days there and still we decided to make the most out of it. What was obvious to us was that we didn't want to stay in Mumbai for a single extra minute that was necessary. First we were thinking about going to Goa but that was a little bit of crazy idea considering that we had just 4 days including the journey and flight tickets were extremely expensive. So then we absolutely fell for the idea of going to Kashid (thanks Indu for the tip!) which is called the Goa for a poor man. Perfect for us! 😊 It was supposed to be only 3 hour drive from Mumbai. And not touristy at all. But of course planning anything in India is always more easy than following the plan afterwards. We landed in Mumbai at 10 pm and it turned out all the safe prepaid taxi operate only within Mumbai and nobody was willing to take us to Kashid (well they even didn't know where Kashid was anyway). We were starting to be quite desperate, it was getting late and the threat
DSC_0406
of staying in Mumbai was more and more real by every minute. Luckily I was able to get back to the airport terminal, not having to bribe the security guys who insisted I have to pay to get back and I found a travel agency which got us a car with a driver for our journey to Kashid for a reasonable price. What followed, was the most scary few hours of my life! The driver was driving really dangerously and we were close to an accident a good few times, the lights didn't work so we were driving in dark, and it took much longer than 3 hours and he was obviously getting tired and annoyed, driving to Kashid for the first time, he was expecting it to be shorter journey as well. At some point I thought we should just stop and wait for the morning but we eventually made it to Kashid in the middle of the night. At night, Kashid looked scary, a tiny village, completely burried in the dark with a few barking dogs running around. Davy took our weak flashlight and was trying to knock on guesthouses doors but no one woke up and no
DSC_0608
one let us in. It looked like an absolute disaster and the last thing I wanted was to have to get back to Mumbai with the crazy driver. He was actually a nice guy and he didn't abandon us there and he helped us to get a room for that night at the end. It was awful dirty small room for outrageous price as the owner could see how desperate we were.

But it wouldn't be India, if we didn't have such a lovely surprised the following day. We went for a walk to explore the village. And it was a tiny quiet place with no white tourists. It was quite popular for Indians though who were coming here for weekends and they gathered at only one spot of the beach which was otherwise deserted. The beach actually looked like the ones in Goa or more precisely how Goa probably used to look like years and years ago before it was discovered by foreign tourists. There were no guesthouses or restaurants on the beach, just a long strand of white golden sand, huge waves of lovely warm ocean and just a few stalls with food. And some dogs which
DSC_0410
looked like they had divided the beach into separate territories. One of the dogs was following Davy for the full 4 days and crossing the territories of other dogs just to be able to make Davy his faithful company. As there was nothing else to do than spend the days on the beach, that is exactly what we did for the last few days of our holidays, jumping into the waves and trying to catch them, and trying to cool down a little as it was the hottest part of the year and the temperature was easily reaching 50 degrees at day time and 30 degrees at night. We also found a lovely guesthouse to stay that actually was one of the nicest of the whole travels. We felt like being part of the family and they cooked for us delicious meals but having no menu and speaking not much english, we usually nodded on whatever they were having for breakfast or dinner themselves. And to make it proper Indian experience, they didn't have any cutlery so even Davy was forced to eat with his hand. We saw an Indian wedding in the village and were invited for a theatre
DSC_0411
play which would have been great experience and way to enjoy a little but of culture together with the rest of the Kashid villagers if we could actually understand what was going on on the stage. Then we discovered that there was actually a golf course in the village and it sounded like a great way how to spend our last day in India but it turned out that the golf course was part of a 5 star hotel and one had to be a guest to be able to play. And the cheapest room they had was for 150 euro per night! After seeing all the poor people all over Asia and owing lots of money at this stage of our travels, it was our time to feel like the poor neighbors and we humbly left the place.

Kashid, although not rich in sightseeing spots, was a perfect place to escape the annoying Mumbai and to enjoy a bit of Indian sun before coming back home. It was obvious that the Indian people coming here for holidays are not the poor ones, as the accommodation was quite expensive (probably more than in real Goa) and they were obviously
DSC_0413
used to be seeing foreigners as they didn't stare at us although we were the only white people in the whole village. Although limited in any forms of amusements and pretty much lacking restaurants and shops, it was definitely worth of visiting. We got to see beautiful unspoiled part of India before it gets into the attention of tourists. And we got our tan back before coming back home 😊

Days 231 – 234 (Fri 26th – Mon 29thApril) Mumbai



So Friday morning I had the pleasure of walking up knowing I only had a few hours before a mammoth 26 hour train journey to Mumbai to get. I headed out to get some money and plenty of snacks and drinks for the trip. I know that people constantly roam the aisles selling stuff but a lot of the time there English isn’t great and I’ve even had them ignore me so to not have to deal with me, and this is when I’ve only wanted a bottle of water or something so I made sure I went prepared for this today.

I headed to the station a good hour before the train as I know the things are huge, like 12-18 carriages long and can take a while to walk up the platform to the correct spot. I got onto the train and went to my ‘sleeper.’ It was only midday but I figured as I’d bought a bed I’d have a bed. Not quite how it turns out. There are 3 bunks to each side of the sleeper but the middle one isn’t in situ.
P1080279
It sort of hangs down as a back rest so the 3 people can sit upright instead, totally defeating the idea of a sleeper. If I’d wanted to sleep straight away that wasn’t happening. It was midday so wasn’t a problem. 3 people are supposed to be on each side so 6 in total, we had 8 and 4 people on the 2 the other side of the aisle. I hate it when things are overcrowded, I really don’t like crowds. I just sat by the window staring out for hours on end listening to my ipod. I had no intention of talking to anyone around me and they were all playing cards and eating every 30 minutes anyways, pretty much 100 percent of the time with their hands which is revolting.

One of my pet hates about this country is the hygiene. Indian people will not let a plastic bottle touch their mouths, making taking a drink a funny thing to watch, especially on moving transport as a jolt means it goes everywhere. They do this because it’s dirty, yet the same people throw all these bottles out of the window with every other bit of rubbish they
P1080283
have and eat from dirty plates with their hands. Surely that is way more unhygienic than drinking from a bottle. It really annoys me every time I see it. Plus most the time they are sat there picking their feet and then happy to tuck into food straight after. To me it just seems dirty and wrong, and the littering is plain lazy.

Anyways around 8pm I was getting sick of this, I sort of edged more and more into a horizontal position to point out I wanted to lie down. I got the middle bunk set up so I could take my bottom bunk. This was sort of pointless as one of the guys ended up sleeping on the floor next to me, about 6 inches away, he snored, he stunk and his arms and legs were constantly flailing onto my bed. I was not a happy bunny and on a few occasions accidentally woke him up by shoving his body parts away from me or shuffling around in my bag. At least that was safe as no way anyone could steal it with a fat lump lying in the middle of the bunks.

The morning cam
P1080290
and everyone was awake at 6am, marvellous. They wanted to put the bunk back as a back rest, I didn’t and held out until well gone 8. Then I spent the remaining 5 hours sat upright dozing and staring out the window wishing I’d get there. The trip took a mere 26 hours and I hated every single minute of it.

On arrival at Mumbai CST I got the usual every taxi driver in town offering me a lift. I just got in one and was scammed as always. I was told it was a long way and it was busy as it was Saturday and he had to take a different route etc. I know this was a lie as shortly after checking in I walked it and it was no distance at all. I probably paid 5 times the amount I should if not more. I got to the hotel anyways and met up with my Dad who’d flown in from home for a week’s holiday and some IPL cricket as well as to see me obviously.

We had to head straight out and fetch our tickets as we had a game that night. We found
P1080293
the office and it was a little small place with 3 girls on computers in a building that was either being done up or knocked down. It was a strange spot to have the only ticket counter in town and was incredibly hot. The humidity here is horrendous and first notice. We relaxed for the afternoon, got some pizza and then headed to the ground where to get in we were searched at least 5 times, got stuck in a huge queue, ended up in a crush on a bridge over the tracks to get in and finally got in 20 minutes into the game. It was an absolute joke and I decided I would email them and complain about it, this has not happened yet however. After the match we found a little restaurant where we could get a beer so ended the night relaxing with a Budweiser.

The following day we headed over to see the Gateway to India arch and the Taj Mahal hotel next to it. Both very impressive structures but the amount of touts and people offering stuff there makes the experience unpleasant to say the least. My dad got attacked by a bloke
P1080295
trying to put something in his ear as well as a pet monkey on a lead. Good start to his holiday. We wandered aimlessly around town for a bit to see what we could find and more importantly find a bar. This did not really happen but we did eat in a very local restaurant, my dad’s first experience of proper Indian food. It was really good and very cheap considering it was in the Causeway area of South Mumbai where things are normally more expensive.

We found a place to go back to in the evening to watch the football on the tv and get some food and finally somewhere serving Kingfisher at a reasonable price. In the afternoon on heading back to the hotel we took a wrong turn and ended up going north and not west. We ended walking past an incredibly poor area of town which wasn’t pleasant. The market looked like a bomb site. There are a lot of people here living rough, too many for the government to be able to do anything about it I imagine.

Monday was spent pretty much lounging around during the day and then at the cricket
P1080297
at night. It was around 90 percent humidity most the time so not pleasant to be out and about in. We did go out and wander along Marine Drive and then south Mumbai for a bit, checked out CST station so we knew where to go in the morning then wandered back again to spend the afternoon in the comfort of an air conditioned room.

This time we headed to the cricket earlier to make sure we didn’t miss it. Dad got turned away for bringing his camera and had to leg it back to the hotel to drop it off. He managed to make it back and only miss the first 5 minutes. This time we got searched 7 times before being let in, in total. It’s crazy how worried they are about their cricket grounds.

We then headed back to the place we found a couple nights ago and went inside the bar this time, and had a few scoops before heading to sleep with an early train in the morning.



Days 235 – 237 (Tues 30th April – Fri 3rd May) Pune



The morning saw and early start followed
P1080299
by a 4 hour train to Pune. The trip itself I quite enjoyed, about half way through you end up in a huge valley with large canyons either side. It’s very picturesque and I thought it was lovely. It was obviously uncomfortable and hot as Indian trains always are and we were in second class seating (cheap seats).

On arrival in Pune we had a google maps of where the hotel was. After 30 seconds I wanted to walk, dad wanted a auto-rickshaw. After a bit of a tiff on the side of the road we got in a rickshaw. This proceeded to take an hour and cost way more than it should have done. We also clocked 12.5km in the auto and on arrival at the hotel and checking google myself it showed the hotel was only 500 metres from the station. The driver had no clue where it was, we drove around for ages in 43 degree heat, it was stupid really. I then walked to get our tickets while Dad relaxed in our very nice executive business hotel room.

We realised the ground was 25km away which is a problem as there aren’t any public
P1080300
transport links to it. We decided to get tea anyways and have a couple beers, being Kingfisher strong at a healthy 8 percent strength. 2 off those and a curry and we headed to train station to find a cab. Managed to get one to take us there, wait and bring us back. It took around an hour to get there, traffic chaotic as always, then getting into the car park was a nightmare. We missed a good 30 mins of the match, it did give us an insight into how early we needed to leave next time.

Wednesday was a write off really. We had nothing to do, it was hot and it happened to be the state ‘Dry Day.’ Dad was especially not happy about this as he’d wanted to get on the beer as had I. There really isn’t a lot to do in Pune so we checked out a shopping mall, which was pretty poor by malls in Asia standard. We went to pizza hut for tea and had a big feast as there is a lack of places to eat in Pune also. There are plenty of road side stalls but with the dirt,
P1080303
flies and pollution in India not a chance I’d risk from eating at one of them. We watched the IPL on tv and the Champions League footy and that was that.

Thursday we looked for somewhere to get a drink for the afternoon. We found the Hard Rock Cafe which was surely the strangest one in their franchise. It’s impossible to find and in a very odd location in Pune. It was also quite large with loads of staff and about 2 tables of people in there. Spent the afternoon supping and then headed back to get a taxi to the cricket, which was slightly more straight forward than Tuesday night. We actually made the start of the game for once. Got back to the hotel around half 12 and I watched some Europa League footy on the tv this time. It’s been nice in India with the time difference being able to watch the European football for a change.

Friday all we did was get some food and hang around until our train back to Mumbai. Once again I enjoyed it as the views are impressive. I had the other side of the coach this time so
P1080306
get the best of both with the trips to and from Pune.

The evening was spent in a restaurant we frequented a couple of times when we were in Mumbai 4 days ago. We got a monster tower of Kingfisher, some food and settled in the for evening with the cricket on the tv and the lovely air con keeping us cool. The place was called ‘Mocha’ and probably the nicest little place in South Mumbai to get good food and have nice surroundings. Makes you think that there aren’t people sleeping on the pavement outside. You could be anywhere else in the world in there and not realise you’re in Mumbai or India.

P1080327
Days 238 – 242 (Sat 4th - Tues 7thMay) Mumbai



So the day had come for my Dad to head back home to the Isle of Man. He left around 10am to go catch his flight. I’d like to think he had a good time here, I know he enjoyed the cricket but I am pretty sure he hated India. He definitely won’t be here again but neither will I. Was tempted to go get on a flight myself but I still have 9 days in the country. I have a couple friends to meet in Delhi next week plus the Taj Mahal to see otherwise I’d have gone to the airport and gone back to South East Asia myself. I moved accommodations to a sort of hostel. I was in the dorm room at the top of the place and it was absolutely boiling in there, even with 3 fans. They have like mesh windows instead of glass so the humidity and heat just seeped in all day so the room never cooled once. I headed out to the cricket ground and enquired about tickets for the next 2 games. Both sold out which was a pain
P1080330
as I hate negotiating with people outside the ground. A few people approached me and offered tickets for 3 to 4 times face value. I decided it wasn’t worth it and headed back to my hostel.

I pretty much spent the rest of the next 3 days in the same routine. I got little sleep during the night due to humidity so was sleeping better from sunrise until about lunch time, then I’d head out, walk around South Mumbai for 2-3 hours. I was normally shattered after this so then spent a little bit of time in the hostel on the computer. In the evenings I went about 2 doors down the road to a place called Cafe Universal and sat there eating, drinking kingfisher and watching the cricket on the tv.

My dorm room was just me and a middle aged India bloke who on the first night told me his name 3 times and asked me mine twice. I tried to avoid him after this as he was clearly crackers.

It seems there is very little to actually do in South Mumbai and as I was so uncomfortable with the humidity I was not in
P1080331
the mood to get a taxi around town to go see things I had no interest in.

One of the days I wandered all the way up Marine Drive to Chowpatty beach. This is not a particularly nice beach. It’s advertised on the city tours etc as a place to go but it’s littered with homeless people and plastic bottles, the sand is not nice either and I would not swim in the sea here as it looks incredibly polluted. The same applied for the beach in Chennai. Normally if I had nothing to do and was by the sea I’d be happy, spend a couple hours swimming about each day and doing some good exercise but you really can’t do that here unless you don’t really fancy staying healthy.

I had booked a train months ago for Wednesday to Delhi. Having done the Chennai-Mumbai trip on sleeper class I tried to book a new train to Delhi in 2AC class which is far nicer however 4 times the price, if not more. I got put on the waitlist for a trip to Delhi on Tuesday but as it got nearer I came down in the waitlist but
P1080332
not enough to make the train so I knew I’d have to wait an extra day in Mumbai and go cattle class, fantastic. I also had to pay for the extra ticket beforehand even though not confirmed which is daft. I know have to claim it back which can take up to 90 days apparently. Not impressed with that either.



Days 243 – 245 (Wed 8th – Fri 10th May) Delhi



A day I have not been looking forward to since I travelled from Chennai. I knew after not enjoying my last sleeper overnight trip this wouldn’t be any better. I had until nearly 5pm to linger around waiting to leave, hence why I’d tried booking an earlier train in a nicer class. Unfortunately that didn’t happen so Plan B. I got to the station, got myself fed and then headed onto the train. This time I had a side upper sleeper which meant from the get go it was a bed which was good and I wasn’t waiting on other people to be able to lie down. The negative being it’s right next to the aisle where people constantly walk up and down
P1080334
and grab your bed for balance, The bed is that small that most the time the people are grabbing your arm, shoulder, knee, or any bit hanging off the side as it doesn’t fit an average male that’s for sure. I am also very conscious about security on these trains. I didn’t like my big bag being under the bottom bunk as I couldn’t see it, but I kept my small bag with all my electronics with me, put my towel over it and used it as a sort of pillow. The 21 hours went as slowly as I imagined they would, but I arrived in Delhi around 2pm and got to my hostel by 3pm. I used the chance of star fishing on my bed straight away and had a kip, drifting in and out until night time. My friends Amy and Louise (met in Chiang Mai Christmas Eve) were arriving the same night and were coming to the same hostel for the night. I just hung around until they got here. I got a phone call from reception and went to meet them. We spent a few hours having a catch up and just chatting about everything since
P1080335
we travelled together for 3 weeks in December and January. It was nice to see them both as they were both heading off to Europe, Louise tomorrow and Amy the day after, so I won’t see them for a long time.

On Friday, Louise left at around 5am so said farewell to her before going back to sleep for a few hours. After this myself and Amy hung out for the day. I haven’t liked India in general and Amy didn’t like Delhi so we just went to a coffee shop, grabbed some food then pretty much chilled out for the rest of the day. Early nights as we both had to be up early in the morning.



Short post but I’ve done very little. Tomorrow I will go to Agra for the Taj Mahal so finally some sightseeing and being a tourist.

May 9th 2013

IMG_7824
Yogapoints Nashik, India

Day One:

Today is our first day, although it doesn't officially start until four in the afternoon. We got to sleep in which was glorious after so many days of traveling. Still sleeping in for me is about 7am and hungry as I was I stuffed my face with a banana. In a few short hours my food becomes contraband.



Better than sleeping in, there was breakfast which was poho which is rice with boiled peanuts and lots and lots of fruit. This is going to be a fabulous breakfast if that is all it is. I have been missing copious amounts of fruit and bam here it is.



We register today, so down I went to the office to fill out my paper work and pay my registration fee. This was nice and easy and amazingly after doing that it was lunch time. I was afraid I would be starving I. Between meals but between back fast and lunch there is just two and a half hours so it isn't too bad.



It especially isn't too bad with this food gracing my plate. While registering we
IMG_7830
each got our own plate and now we had the chance to use it. There was naturally rice but on top of that there was a mung bean soup like thing, a fabulously refreshing tomato salad and chibati, nice and warm.



The meals are eaten in silence and I had a minor fear of this to begin with. I mean I love to talk. Breakfast is naturally easy because everyone is just waking up. Lunch I thought would be a bit more difficult but as it turns out being silent during a meal is actually kind of nice. There is no pressure to entertain and you can really focus on the food, enjoying every bite as you chew 32 times. Just kidding it is impossible to chew mush 32 times.



Before everything starts it seems that the ashram is quite dead. A lot of people have headed into the city to get stuff done but my roommates and I have chosen to relax in the shade with a book. Relaxation changed when a newbie t the ashram joined.



Okay look I know that here at the ashram the should be no
IMG_7840
gossip or judgement or whatever but sometimes one can't help but have thoughts of ""Is this girl fucking serious"" run through their head. It is totally acceptable if I don't say these thoughts and just write them down right? Okay I'm going to try not to even write them down actually. I'll be a good ashram girl.



I can only stay good for so long however. When Kat offered me a tasty snack, right after I stuffed my face with a filipino piaya I accepted. When she offered another just a few minutes before everything got real I had my one last sin before officially becoming a ashram girl.



Introduction to the ashram began around four. Our Guru came on in to speak to us. He wore his orange outfit and talked to us about the ashram. He seems like a lovely fellow but the accent is hard. Not just hard it is close to impossible to understand him. I focus and focus and then a thought jumps into my mind which is much more interesting that trying to understand his accent.



Plus I get more distracted by the backpacks being
IMG_7857
brought in. I love free stuff. I mean technically it isn't free but it seems free now that I paid a few hours ago. My eyes flit from Guru to the bags and back again. I can already see how this whole focus thing is going to be an issue.



Guru finally ends and we get a bit more into the particulars. Oh the rules of the ashram. They have been a myth to us until now where it becomes official. Conversing with the boys in their room, naughty. The run Rob and I went on the other day, illegal. The snacks Cat and I ate, reprimand able. Not to mention the dress code. Pants past our knees and no shoulders being shown. Do they realize how hot it is here? And I, nothing like the hippies around me, don't own nine Ali babba pants with free flowing shirts to match. No, I have two pairs of tights, hiking pants, and running shorts. Am I really going to have to invest in Ali babba pants? I don't have time to complain though because the backpacks are being handed out. Excitement brews as I open it up and
IMG_7859
see a few books, a much needed pen, a nettle pot and notebook. This backpack is a success although I am already wondering how exactly I'm going to get it home.



My first go at chanting followed and I knew it was going to be rough. I was hungry, tired and in no mood to recite the same passage over and over again but I didn't drop a couple thousand grand in rupees not to do everything so off me and the crew went. We sat in our proper cross legged pose and I stared up at the words that I was suppose to recite. Each round I'm sure I pronounced it differently and being cranky it never got any better. My stomach was growling despite the huge lunch and I just wanted to get through all of the rounds. It is fair to say I lost focus about half way through.



But then it ended, I placed some ash on my forehead and practically ran out of there. As luck would have it both Cherry and Cat seem to love food as much as I do and I foresee us being first in
IMG_7860
line many a times. In fact we were a smidge early which required us to put e food in its proper place, ie scope out the goods. There was yellow mushy stuff green mushy stuff vegetables and mini pancakes and naturally rice. Yum is all I can say.



The shop is opened this evening and everyone is excited this everyone and their mom is there this evening including myself. The only thing I need is some tissue but that is very important so off I went. Naturally I ended up picking up some snacks, dried guava and some tasty sweet. I took a gander at the Ali babba pants and cringed, can we say not my style at ALL!



From there I was exhausted and chose to go to sleep. Tomorrow is a very VERY early morning.



Day Two:



it is our first full day here in the ashram and I'm excited to see how the day goes trying not to set up any expectations and just go with whatever comes my way. I woke early and headed over to the dining hall to get some tea only
IMG_7871
to find no tea at all. There was soy milk, so i grabbed a glass and questioned whether this little glass was going to satisfy me until breakfast time which wouldnt happen for another 3 1/2 hours.



We all headed over to the main hall were we did a bit of chanting and then asana class began. We learned the twelve predatory moves which were terribly easy and the whole time I wondered, is this really what we are going to be doing. I'm in India and I'm not even breaking a sweat. Without running or P90X I am naturally a bit concerned about staying fit but I'm trying to push that from my mind.



After class we have karma yoga which is a lovely little concept where you do something around the ashram without expecting anything. We will be assigned random tasks through out our stay here but for today we just have to clean up our rooms.



Kat, Cherry and I do that but the moment the bell rings we drop everything and head to the kitchen. I think I am definitely in a room who is like minded
IMG_7872
and has their priorities straight, I.e. are always ready for meal time!



Lectures, lectures, lectures it is like being back in uni and it is great. It would be better if Guruji wasn't boring as anything but other lectures throughout the day are much more inspiring and really quite interesting. I love feeling like I'm back at school, it is so great and makes me consider going back for my masters.



In between the lectures I was introduced to the most magical form of yoga yes, yoga nidra. Basically you just lie back on your mat while someone leads you through ehat could be compared to hypnosis. It is amazing and I really can't even explain the sensations you feel. Homies back home, we can totally try this and you will love it!



Lunch and mint tea where also in between lectures and both were lovely. We had time to relax so I grabbed my book and enjoyed a cool breeze passing through until lecture time.



Asana class was short today but I did learn some new postures. I suppose we have to learn new postures before we
IMG_7882
can start holding the and really pushing ourselves.



Afterwards my roomies and I went to chanting. I was skeptical about this, reciting the same chant 108 times is t the most appealing thing in the world to me but I tried it out and it wasn't that bad. A run would have been better but hey what can you do.



Dinner followed and it was lovely. I really enjoy the Indian food he, in fact I probably enjoy it to much I gotta keep myself in check now at I'm not exercising 3 times a day.



The evenings lecture has been canceled so we all chilled outside until it was time to go to bed. I can get use to ashram life.





Day Three:



The bell officially ran this morning, it wasn't just in my dreams. I was already awake and this I got up and out of the room in a hot second. In the cafeteria I patiently waited for the tea much like everyone else who bothered to roll out of bed at such an early hour.



It came eventually and I can't claim that it was worth the wait but it was something in my belly and my belly appreciated that very much. I read a bit while I waited and sat in peace. I am actually digging this quiet time.



There is a bit of chanting before yoga starts and it is lovely. We sit in cross legged position and repeat after our Guru. I'm surprised by how much I enjoy the chanting despite the fact that I am still saying things wrong. Maybe it is because in the am the chanting is so short? Yes, that is probably why.



The yoga is lovely as always. We review our poses from yesterday and start with some new ones. I'm surprised with how fast the yoga goes and I'm sad when it comes to and end. My one complaint is that it is so slow moving. I mean I know it is Hatha yoga but seriously we get a move here and there than sit and watch. My heart rate never increases and my lack of exercising, serious exercising, makes me resent this slow moving yoga stuff. I mean seriously could we just do some P90X yoga??



I can't stay mad for long however because it is breakfast time. Fruit again, oh how I love my fruit, and mystery grain. At least I think it is a grain. Mixed in are some vegetables and its got a bit of a savory touch going on. Whatever it is it is delicious. Breakfast fills me and I am happy about that, frankly any time fruit is involved I am happy.



Lecture time. I have to say the first lecture is again tough for me. I just want to sleep through it despite the fact that I find the topic interesting. Thankfully after lecture number one there is Nidra yoga and oh how I love that. I had every intention of staying awake throughout it but once more I failed. If you can consider it a failure because afterwards I felt great.



Lunch came after Nidra Yoga and followed by that was an italian lesson and some tomato juice.



Lecture today was on injury prevention and I found this to be a great lecture for the simple fact that I always seem to be injured. The Doctor is a great lecturer so it was easy to stay awake.



Asana class almost got my heart pumping... But didn't so I did some cardio and then ran off to chant. I have mixed emotions about chanting but today was great. Guruji's wife lead it and she is so spunky and fabulous. We did the chants about 10xs faster than we normally do and that was amazing! If she always did it I would probably always go. She also lead the evening session which included singing and dancing. She got us all up and dancing in a circle while singing Indian chants. It was so ridiculously fun. I have no idea what it has to yoga but hey I'm not complaining.



Day Four:

The day started earlier than usual because I was chocking off my karma yoga at 4:40am. I was a tea maker and knew that the other students would be eagerly awaiting the tea as the bell tolled just as I had done the days before.



Of course as easy as the tea making sounds we failed to make it in a reasonable time. Laura was Rita and my teacher and she did a fabulous job minus the fact that she didn't know where anything was. We were making soy ginger tea, so the evening before we had soaked the ginger and then this morning we peeled, grated, and squeezed out the juices of the ginger. In the mean time we put soy flavored with spices in our boiling water which proceeded to boil over despite all of us being warned that that might happen.



Squeezing ginger is not the easiest of tasks as it turns out. Despite all the ginger we had peeled and grated there hardly seemed any juice at all and when we added it to our soy tea, well lack of flavor is an understatement. On top of that Rita is a raw vegan and doesn't believe in soy or something so she didn't try it leaving Laura and I to decide how it should taste. Forty minutes after starting we were finally placing the tea out for the masses to consume. There were no compliments to be had, as I myself loaded up on the cinnamon.



Tea karma should have allowed me time before lunch when everyone else would be doing their own karma yoga. It's time was going to be spent doing a cardio work out because despite being fed only three times a day and being feed what I'm told is an incredibly healthy diet I am feeling fat. That is just a fact. I think I'm more swollen than anything but the fact that my rings aren't sliding off as they use to is driving me up the wall. Of course the yoga gods probably knew how much I wanted this workout that they turned things topsy turvey on me and switched the schedule up so that we had a lecture during that time and the karma yoga after breakfast, I.e. one of the worst times to exercise.



The yoga this morning can be deemed relaxing if one wasn't so focused on the fact that nothing was being worked out. I just want a solid work out. Is that to much to ask for. I mean we don't even hold the poses in sun salutations, because this is Hathaway yoga and not weight loss yoga, but still. I want to run, or P90X or old school village elliptical. I may be going stir crazy?



The lecture was about positions and let me tell you, I have no idea what he talked about. Why? Because my stomach was rumbling and I wanted me some oatmeal and fruit. And then after thinking that I though, no I need to simmer down on the food because I'm fat. I then took a picture of my face and compared it to a photo of me two months ago. I poked my abs and grabbed my thighs. Yes I need to get some serious work out in let's just state that off the bat!



I'm having problem with the food here too. It is absolutely delicious. Everything they make is so good and although I know I need to portion control things I seem to pile it all onto my plate and eat it all with no grace at all. Every dish is mushy and green or yellow and totally tasty. Breakfast today is naturally the staple of fruit but today paired with a mung bean and tomato salad like dish. Can we say delicious, like everything else they serve.



Consumed and full now everyone else had karma yoga while I sat around lazy wishing I was naive to the fact that eating and then exercising is bad for you. While contemplating that I also thought to myself that I wish I had bought a language book to learn Spanish. I officially officially want to learn Spanish. But before I learn Spanish I want to get skinny again. Looks at picture from now and two months ago again and get frustrated.



Nidra yoga should make me feel better... That is until we learn that today there will be no nidra yoga which is devastating to all of us who walk in matin hand awaiting a pleasant refreshing nap. Because let's face it, most of us end up falling asleep and having the most fabulous nap making us wake up refreshed and new. No instead we had another lecture.



Guru gets up on stage and I know it is going to be a roug forty five minutes. He is a lovely fellow but it is terribly hard to understand him at times. Not to mention that his lecture is dreadfully boring. On top of those two facts he is virtually reading from the book. This I don't have to pay attention and instead choose to pick at my nails so that I can wear half black and half purple. I guess at least I'm not freaking out about my weight, oh wait yeah I am.



Lunch. You would thing with all my concerns about weight I would try and ignore the whole food thing. But no, despite eating just two hours ago I'm ready for anther go of food. And delicious food as always! Mushy yellow stuff and mushy green stuff all of it was so tasty. I tried to cut back in the carbs, no I did. Ere wasn't any chibata today so I just had a smidge of rice instead mostly to soak up all the tastiness from the mushy stuff.



Relaxation time is my favorite time. I read and journal and write these blogs that hopefully will be posted whenever I get wifi again. Today however I'm working a bit with the Italians. It must be hard to have just a minor understanding in English and then come here where everything is in English with a strong Indian accent. I don't mind helping though because Max is scrumptious.



What followed relaxation time was just as fabulous. Our Gurus wife came in to teach us about Om. The woman must be in her 80s and she is the most fabulous, spunky woman ever. She wears her sari and bindi, her tummy is slightly exposed and she just talks with the most amazing voice ever. If the only sound I hear for the rest if my life was her saying Om it would be fine.



I wish she could do all lectures but a las she cannot. Instead what follows is more yoga. We start getting our blood flowing and the bam it's back to the mats to earn something new. Then we preform and my muscles think to themselves, thank you Erin for working me out and then shazam that move is over and I'm back to just sitting and watching. I know that this is the way you earn, and that it is being done in the best way possible but girl needs her cardio.



When we had learned all we needed to learn for the day I popped over to my room, said no thank you to chanting and got my workout on. Oh how glorious. I love ecardio fit. The Aussie pair that I watch are just fabulous. I don't seem to be walking away as sweaty as I use to so I may need to change up the work out soon but for now it is my nirvana to do push-ups and sumo squats.



My workout ended just a hot second before dinner should begin so I ran into the shower bucket showered away and put on the same outfit I wear every evening. You see the limited amount of appropriate pants makes me wear my hiking pants every evening. Have I mentioned that I lost a lot of weight. I have? Okay well now imagine putting on pants that were a smidge lose on you 30 pounds ago. I'm like one of those annoying kids that always has his boxers hanging out and is constantly pulling up their pants. Only they do it by choice and I do it because I have no other option.



Holding onto my pants I sprint up the stairs because the bell has rung and apparently I fear that for this meal there will be a major shortage and I will be left with nothing. As it turns out we aren't even allowed in. We must wait For the more devoted students who went off to chant... And chant.. And chant. Seriously if they want to chant into dinner time they need to accept the consequences that I am going to eat while they are chanting.



Finally we breath a hungry sigh of relief as the bell is rung once more and we are allowed in. Oh the aromas are like heaven. Each and ever time I enter the kitchen for a meal I can't help but close my eyes and take a deep breath in. I don't believe in heaven but if I we to ever go to one mine would be filled with exercise equipment and food. I think the food would be on a rotation system. You know one day Thai food, one day Indian, one day American. What exactly is American food I can't say but it deserves a day I suppose.



Today's heaven came in the form of tomato curry, cucumber salad, a tinsy bit of rice, chibata, leftover green mushy stuff, baked potato, and soy milk. Let me tell you when the last time I had a baked potato was. Oh wait, I can't because I have to recollection it was that long ago. The little mine potato was just like I remembered only in the past I would have slathered it with butter and today I just dipped it in my curry.



I broke all personal rules today by going back for more, a lot more. But to be fair I had next to notice, all of it was veg, and I had a real work out prior to eating. I think all of this deserves and second helping of delicious green mush.



Not wanting to part ways with the wonderful aroma of the room, I eventually cleaned my plate that looked as if it had been licked clean and headed over to our main building were we were to do introductions. It seems a bit late to be doing such a ing, most of us having met each other already but I suppose we are going under the assumption of better late then never perhaps?



Sitting in a circle we began the usual. Name, origin and what brought you here. Laura, the woman I had done tea with this very morning began. Or at least she attempted too. She got through name and origin and then the lights went out. They came back on and went back off just as she was to tell us why. While the lights were off the other Erin got a bloody nose. This in itself took a chunk of time as everyone had their own remedies as to how to cure her. Apparently an onion on her face was the winning cure.



Eventually Laura was able to finish her synopsis and I was next. I kept it short and sweet. As did most people but there are always those few that feel the need to tell their life story. Nothing against you fellow but I don't care that you messed up your back and travelled the world and this that and the other just tell me your name and pass it on!



We only made it through half the circle due to nose bleeds, long winded answers, a dog, bee, and cockroach intrusion. The clock showed that it was nearly 9:30 and in ashram world this is late as anything. I should be in bed reading or slowly drifting off to sleep. Luckily our leader recognize this and dismissed us to continue on the following day.



What did I do? Hit my bed, read and drift off to sleep. Fabulous



Day Five:



Ding dong witch is dead, or the bell is sounding for us to wake up. Up already I through on my clothes, brushed my teeth and hit the kitchen to wait for the tea. I brought my book and a don't interrupt me face because I am so close to the end and The Alchemist is such a fabulous book I can't seem t out it down. That is except when my eyes can't seem to stay open or if food is in my presence or if I could be working out.



The tea this morning was better than my mornings version and I through a bit of cinnamon in it just to give it a bit more of a well flavor. I sipped and read and sipped and read and my face warded off all those who may have had the slightest inclination to be my friend.



My determination to read won and I finished off the book which was as splendid as I knew it would be. And I couldn't have finished at a better time. The bell was ringing once more and off we all paraded to the hall, yoga mat in hand.



I took my usual spot and we preformed our usual postures. I am wearing cotton trousers, a dreadfully hot pair, and my one hippy esq type shirt. I may blend in with this shirt but it restricts my movements just a smidge and well is still dirty from the last time I wore it... Back in the Philippines.



The first hour is great, we do our warm up and sun salutation and I nearly break a sweat and my muscles are happy for the activity. And then we learn. Only today we a learning some fun poses. First we go into upside down inversion. Good old Tony taut me this one so I rock it without any issues. However the counter pose, fish, is something I have only seen in my nightmares. Google it, it isn't very comfortable and apparently my back has no flexibility and I was in minor fear that I'd snap my neck off in some gruesome horror movie type way. Luckily my neck stayed attached and all was well. The last pose we learned was Archers Pose. Another one that caused me to question my flexibility as I watched our instructor hop into the pose as if he was just chillaxing. I then attempted and floundered quite a bit but in the end I was able to do it better than I assumed I could. To be fair I had pretty low expectations.



Karma yoga time was next and I wish I had been on tea so I could you know work out but a las I was not so instead I was assigned to clean the main hall. The hall is huge and the three of us have to sweep, mop and clean outside. The only blessing being that now I will concentrate on the pain in my back as I hunch over to sweep and mop and not the hunger in my belly that was interrupting the end of yoga.



I'm doing my best not to focus on food but seriously sometimes I can't help it. It is just so tasty and fabulous and the aroma lingers in my memory and the idea of fruit, lots and lots of fruit just fills me with joy.



As the cleaning crew finished up the room the bell rang and we made our way over. Rice with boiled peanuts and fruit. I took just a smidge of rice, I've decided that breakfast is the only time I will eat rice now, unless the is no other carb in that meal and if I must tae it I will take just a bit. This stems from the fact that I'm no longer doing intense cardio like I was and that I still feel swollen! The fruit is fabulous as always and the little bit of rice enjoyable and the two together with some tea and this slow chewing method makes me full in no time.



I had been eating in the cafeteria, in the same exact seat where I could look out the window and really enjoy the scenery. Only I couldn't quite enjoy it from my point of view, not to mention the screen that blocks my view so instead of taking the same seat I made my way outside. The first thing I do as I walk outside is spill boiling tea over my hand. Should i take this as an omen? I choose not to and instead take in the beautiful view that surrounds me. There is a breeze to keep us cool and the view is just to fabulous to be made at the fact that my hand is burning intensely. I'm more mad that I wasted some tea.



I enjoyed my meal, made some tea water and headed over to the much anticipated yoga nidra. I was primed and ready for disappointment that it may be cancelled now that one of the volunteers had left but I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the other students ready to read out to use.



Laying down my mat and the laying down on top of it I made the resolution to NOT sleep this go. I concentrated hard on the words the woman spoke and I repeated over and over not to sleep. It is hard to say if I succeeded. Yoga nidra is unique in the fact that it borders a sleep and wakefulness so I can't say for sure if I drifted off or not but I'm nearly certain I made it the entire way without drifting off. Either way I did a hell of a lot better than the last time that is for sure. Did I also mention that my rings feel looser, my cheeks less chubby and the muffin top that only exists in my head has vanished.



Guruji is doing the lecture this morning. I suppose reading out of a book can be considered a lecture of you put it on a power point and have students around you. He is reading out to us about YAMA social discipline which are a bit like the Ten Commandments of the yogi world. It promotes non-violence, truthfulness, non stealing, sex control, and non possessiveness. After lunch we had the other six commandments which are niyama which includes self discipline, purity, contentment, austerity, self study and surrender to god. I can't say I really paid attention to well any of it but I'm sure the book will tell me all I need to know. I think I'm just going to keep 10 of the commandments and by pass the whole god thing again.



In between our two lectures there was lunch and relaxation time. Spinach chibatas, this that and the other and it was all delicious. Relaxation was also enjoyable. With my book done and max looking adorable as ever I sat down with him and got my first Italian lesson. It is such a beautiful language and similar to Spanish so I am catching a few words here and there. Maybe I can walk away from here with a yoga teaching certification and the ability to speak a smidge of Italian.



After lesson two of our commandments, ignoring most of the lecture and concentrating on the book I want to write and what dinner would be and whether I was going to chant or exercise tonight I chatted it up with another American girl. We warned me about bringing the mood down, but she informed me that there was a bombing at the Boston Marathon. My jaw didn't just drop, it feel to the floor and remained there. Who, what, where, when, and why all ran through my head and flew from my mouth but she was unable to answer any of it. Matt came into my mind somewhere in between all the W questions. I knew Matt was running the race, was he alright, did he even run so many questions and no way to find out.



Overwhelmed I word vomited in Rob's direction and he being the nice guy that he is let me borrow his phone to text home. How was I suppose to doing my yoga now, he offered to let the teacher know that I wasn't going to make it but instead I chose to come and do the yoga and try and take my mind off everything. Besides I didn't want to sit and just stare at the phone. So yoga I did with all the zeal in the world.



Two hours later I still felt anxious and just wanted to run. Not an option I just wanted to exercise. But both my roomies convinced me that a good round of chanting may be better to calm my mind. I hemmed and hawed over what to do, I wanted to push myself and lose myself in a hard core workout but chanting was exactly what might calm my mind. The big problem if course being that I find chanting to be a bit hokey. But off I went, I chatted with Cherry about the world and how fucked it is that someone would do this and the we sat down and chanted.



I'm still a firm believer in science. I don't believe in god or Mother Earth or this that and the other but I did find myself wishing that I could accept one or all of them. I wanted to believe that my chanting was really sending out positive energy and I suppose I can only hope that that is what I was doing. I have to say at the end of it I was feeling quite a bit better so perhaps there is someone to all this nonsense, I mean spirituality.



To help me take my mind off this even more food was being served. I can't say it was the best meal that they served he but it was alright. There were little rice pancake things called ilid, and coconut chutney, tomato curry and a few veggies. I ate slow and steady and filled my belly not to the max but until I felt good.



The rest of the introductions we preformed that evening with little interest to me as I kept wondering about home. I suppose chanting and food can only clear your mind for so long. When that was over Cherry allowed me to check out her phone which gave me a little insight as to what happened back home. I wish I could say I understood but can anyone understand when things such as this happens?



Day Six

Anxiety over whether or not Matt is okay wavers between being overly confident that he is okay to holy fuck how do I know. I am up before the bell can even ring and in the cafeteria before the tea has even begun to boil. Max's Italian lesson keeps me busy as I try to memorize and remember the words and phrases he has taught me. When that can no longer keep me focused I switch to reading The Selfish Gene by Dawkins. It seems a strange book to read here but after such a spiritual journey book such as The Alchemist I felt the need to get back to some reality and science. It's just a bit to much spirituality that I wish I could latch onto in this time but still can't wrap my head around it.



Yoga was great this morning. We were worked hard, holding poses, doing our sun salutations. I can actually feel the strength in my body growing. I wish at times we could do more but after conversing with others I am realizing I may be the only one to think that.



My karma yoga for the day was to clean the library. What an easy task. Two of us to clean one small room. We got done with time to spare and I spent that washing clothes. Well ok I have no detergent so I just used some soap and coconut oil and baking powder sure all that together totally works, it is better than not doing it at all that's a fact.



Breakfast of champions, or of yogi students is fruits and a grain. Today more rice with boiled of peanuts. My portions for fruit are out of control but it is the only time the day we get any so I stock up. Plus I love fruit, a lot. Maybe I should try and pinch some to eat later, no no I need to only eat when It is the time to eat I need to stop thinking about how to get more food.



Honestly for the most part I'm not craving food like I usually am. Sure I get a bit hungry when meal time rolls around but in between there are few moments where I actually consider getting the food I have stored away out and stuffing my face with it. Maybe the meals are well rounded or my portions are that out of control or my mind is getting strong. I am also not working out three times a day so I'm not burning the 1000 plus calories I was back in the village and that definitely has a big part in it. Now that I know and realize I can only eat whatever I want when I am pulling three a days I now know I can survive on a lot less.



My favorite part of the day seems to now be scheduled after breakfast. Yoga nidra, oh what a glorious hour of relaxation. Again I honesty can't say for sure if I stayed awake the entire time or not but when it was over I felt relaxed and ready for whatever the day would bring. Which would one fully be more food. Sure I'm not hungry yet but I still love thinking about food.



Lectured droned on so I chose to read my kindle. Lunch followed and then Ghandar's lecture about Hatha yoga which is far more interesting than anything Guruji has to say. Yoga was the same same as this morning, sun salutations followed by twisting pose followed by this that and the other. It is getting better slowly but surely.



I chose to go chanting despite not really wanting to go. I sat on the mat and tried to get comfortable but kept figitting. I couldn't focus and we we doing the chants so slow which is literally just painful for me. I couldn't focus so I day dreamed and witness us ending the chanting eleven chants early. This is no complaint but I did find it interesting.



Dinner was lovely but what was better was just hanging out with everyone outside until the lights we switched off. Guess that means bed time.



Day Seven

Up and waiting for tea in the dark as I read some good old Dawkins. Today's tea was exceptionally tasty and I just felt really great about the day and I had good reason too. When I bumped into Rob I got some good news, Matt was a okay! I skipped to class relief spilling over.



That was just the beginning of a grand day. Yoga was great. We were holding poses and doing sun salutations and I could almost count it as a work out. Almost.



I had to clean toilets for karma yoga which may not sound that great but with three people cleaning a tiny area we were done with time to spare. This time was spent fantasizing over breakfast which I hoped would be oatmeal.



Oh karma gods your looking our for your little ashram girl because it wasn't just oatmeal it was oatmeal with raisins and some corn flakes! Heaven. My mouth salivated as I ladled on fruit, oatmeal and warm milk. I ate in silence, savoring every bite. Even if we were allowed to talk I'm not sure if I would because each bite was just magical!



If getting good news, easy karma, delicious breakfast wasn't enough it was yoga nidra time. I fell into that crazy state that only someone who has experienced yoga nidra or maybe one who has been hypnotized can understand. It is pure bliss to wake up from a session, relaxed and rejuvenated.



Before lecture started I had yet another Italian lesson. I'm really trying hard to learn my words and such. I wish I tried this hard with Thai. If I had a cuter tutor in Thai maybe I would have. It is fun working with Max because as he says we are tandem learning and it is true. His English is definitely getting better and well my Italian has nowhere to go but up!



Lectures today were dull because again Guruji just read from his book. Thus I studied Italian instead. But in between lectures there was lunch which had some lovely okra bindi, beet salad, chipati, rice, and veggies. The okra was divine! The beet really splendid. And the chipati tasty as always.



Yoga this afternoon was as fabulous as this morning but not enough for me to pass on a cardio workout. We finally ended almost in time so I ran back to my room and rocked out a 30 minute cardio session to my roommates bewilderment.



Chanting was nice and speedy today. I love when it goes fast which probably means I don't exactly love chanting. Fact is I feel a bit pressured because A) I dropped major cash to do everything here and B) my roomies are both dedicated chanters and I feel the need to not be the one failure in the group.



Dinner was the only disappointment for the day. The carrot poecetha (spelling is probably wrong but basically like a carrot chipati) was delicious and the rest was tasty just not filling in the least. Tomato rice, kaelini, and cucumber salad. Again tasty just not filling.



We had a not so brief discussion on what we were doing tomorrow because tomorrow is our day off! I had every intention in going to the old town but it isn't recommended for tomorrow so now I am questioning whether I want to go at all. I guess I'll decide in the morning.



Day Eight



I woke up refreshed having slept in until 6 am. It was so nice to gave an extra hour of sleep and what to do now, run. I put on my scandalously short running shorts assuming nobody else would be awake, strapped on my running shoes and hit the pavement. Literally all I did was run around the inside of the ashram. This is quite difficult for multiple reasons.



A) there are stairs involved and I hate stairs. I mean I hate them. Walking them, looking at them, running them they are just torturous for me. B) true most of it is paved but then some foot not so much. Can we say ankle breaker trail with rocks and holes and chunks of brick becoming an obstacle course. C) as it turns out not all living things at the ashram have adopted the non violence Yama we are suppose to exhibit. Oh no, in fact one of the dogs may be the exact opposite as he charges the gate each and every time I go by and all I can do is think ""please don't escape, I really don't want another ass cheek dog bite"". And there you have it, in a loop that takes just three minutes for a slow runner such as myself I feel as tough I am constantly avoiding something. BUT it is also a great run. The stairs are challenging and a step incline keeps me huffing and puffing. Oh I miss running!



After a shower there is just way to much time before breakfast. I had decided to go into town if for no other reason than to check my Internet. So why not go into town looking pretty. Kat and I took the extra time to beautify ourselves and then we headed to breakfast.



To town we went but once there I really had to use the bathroom, too much tea, and needed to wait for kids to get out of the way. She had no desire to wait so off she went. Instead I joined Ava, Max, Rob and Lino as we wandered aimlessly around town. Seriously aimlessly is an understatement. We got lost, found our way, meandered, bought chocolate, headed for a bazaar that doesn't exist and the contemplate lunch. I really wanted to eat out but was in no mood to eat with Ava. Max wanted pizza and Rob wanted to eat back at the our place. Refusing both Ava and pizza I chose ashram food.



We split up and stopped to get Max his pizza. He devoured it in seconds with a smile on his face. Then we hit the school were I confirmed making the wrong depiction because the food was perhaps one of their worse meals. And by worse I simply mean boring. Oh I could have eaten meat or spices or anything but no I had to be lame. Sometimes I should just venture off myself but I just enjoy the boys company to much.



Internet time didn't last long enough because I wanted to head back early so after finishing up a few emails we headed back to the office and waited. The cab was suppose to come at 3, or at least that is what we thought but after much confusion we realized it wasn't going to come until 4. So much for getting back early. Instead Max gave me an Italian lesson which was just as good and then we hit the road back home.



With sunset approaching Kat, Pat and I headed up the to so mountainous mountain to take some photos. The walk up was easy enough and unfortunately snake less and on top the view was quite nice. The sunset left a lot to be desired but it was nice and cool up there so that alone made it worth it.



Pat decided to rock out some chanting while Kat and I just meandered. Randomly someone ran by and we stared thinking it was one of our trainers. When he waved we responded and as we got closer and closer we realized it wasn't Ramon at all, but the fellow was nice enough and even grabbed a photo with us. I love being in photos with random people.



We hiked back down in time for dinner and called it a night nice and early. Days off are exhausting.



Day Nine



Tea time followed by asana practice where we all practice the moves we are going to have to preform for this afternoons test. I suppose I'm ready for the exam, really all I can do is my best and that's that.



Karma yoga in the chanting room was rewarded by delicious oatmeal and fruit. Anatomy lectures followed, these I find most interesting. I am sure I learned it all before in school but it is a nice refresher and Dr. Douli is a great lecturer.



Lunch and relaxing before the exam is necessary. The exam itself ended up not being to bad at all. To be fair one of our examiners totally screwed my crew over for one posture but other than that it went really well. Really I'm not all that nervous about it. I would have to do the wrong moves to fail I think.



Afterwards I did a nice cardio workout and headed for dinner. Called it an early nice. For a test day it was a pretty relaxing day.



Day Ten



Oh what a slow morning as I pried myself from my bed and stumbled to the kitchen. I act as if it is necessary for me to be the first in the kitchen. There's that competitive spirit that I should be trying to get rid of at least here in the ashram.



The morning went along with nothing unusual to report. Asanas were nice, a few more sun salutations was the most exciting part. Lino, Cherry and I cleaned outside the office and my micro lesson where I got all nervous once more. Breakfast was tasty as usual and then we progressed to lecture time



I was excited for the lectures today because they were on Ayuverda which is something I never heard of until I came here and so I know nothing about it. Unfortunately I still know nothing on it and the lecture could literally be qualified as torture it was so bad. What is really torturous and the fact that we had TWO lectures by the guy.



Lunch was a redeeming factor to the afternoon and Ghandar gave a lecture that was at least a bit interestinge. Asanas were same same as usual but what was really cool was what happened after class.



Our three teachers, Ghandar, Roman, and Roshod, did a bit of showing off. They did all the fancy moves that are just off the chain crazy. They easily twist their bodies into the craziest posture. I can't even explain it so just check out the pictures that really don't even do it justice.



Max and I did a mini workout and headed to dinner. Afterwards a group of us chilled out at the picnic tables just chatting it up. Little R offered us chocolate powder, literally the powder you make chocolate milk with, and we all grabbed some. Are we that desperate for sweets? The answer is yes. Perfect goodnight snack.



Day Eleven



I've dance to celebrate Mother Nature, had rakki preformed on me, exercised my lady parts and learned some Italian. It is fair to say that today has been a fabulous day.



Morning started with tea and a book and progressed to chatting it up with Pat. After two glasses and a conversation in strange dreams including death we head on over to start our yoga practice.



Yoga gets better and better every day as we learn more and more postures. Not to mention the numerous sun salutations we do. It isn't just the number that is increasing but the tempo as well. We do a handful of speedy sun salutations that get the blood pumping. It is GREAT!



Micro lessons still leave a lot to be desired by me. Despite having the best group ever I instantly turn red and act a fool but I like to think I'm acting a little less of a fool each and every time. We got done early which allowed me to wash my clothes before breakfast.



Sometimes it really doesn't feel much different then village life. I mean I'm still exercising constantly, eating healthy, washing clothes in a bucket and showering from a bucket. I sleep under a mosquito net and am constantly sweating my ass off. I'm use to a dress code and Thai time which is quite similar to India time. I hear complaints coming from here and there and with the exception of my lack of chili I have little to complain about because this is they way I've been rocking it for the last two years. In fact the fact that there are English speakers around just makes it ten times easier here. I may be e only one finding ashram life easier than their lives before hand.



There is a festival beginning today and because of it we get no fruit for breakfast. This would be depressing if the fruit wasn't subbed out for delicious sweets that taste like cracker jacks. Karma yoga lead me to the second floor of the dining hall there were four of us working on the tiny area leading us to finish at a rapid pace.



Yoga nidra is always so great. I always think I've made it through the whole thing and then hear people talking about the visualization and realize I didn't even come close to making it through the whole shebang. But that is okay because either way I wake up refreshed.



This is necessary since we have lectures nested. One on pranayama, or the vital energy streaming through all of us, and then cleansing techniques. Luckily Ghandar is giving the talks and he is always quite interesting. However learning about breathing was certainly less interesting than learning about cleansing techniques. In the near future we will be learning to use Netti as well as learning to vomit. Sounds exciting!



Before lunch we checked out the festival that was going on. There was a good amount of people



Lunch was fantastic and afterwards Cherry and I joined V powers. What is this you ask? Well it goes by many names, V power, Intimate Aerobics, Pelvic Exercises, essentially it is just another exercise routine just for you vajayjay and anus. Bernadette teaches these workshops in Singapore and is now teaching us and it is really quite interesting. There are so many health benefits AND nobody can even tell your exercising.



Asana class followed by my own Pilates class makes me a happy camper. Dinner is afterwards making me even more happier because it is as tasty as ever. As we all hung around outside Lino came by and preformed some rakki on Rob. Watching this I then asked Max to preform it on me. If I understand it correctly Max is essentially the in between person between me and energy. I don't really get it but it was cool.



When that was over we all headed over to whe the festival was taking place earlier and learned a bit about it. Essentially it is worshiping Mother Nature. Apparently we are quite lucky because there aren't normally three auspicious holidays right in a row. After learning a bit about it we all started chanting which lead to dancing and naturally a good time.



Exhausted afterwards we all headed to bed



Day Twelve



Tea, asanas and micro lesson. Is has become our lives. During micro lesson I am still annoyingly nervous which is so silly but sometimes you just cant help it. The nerve racking micro lesson was over and done with and followed by a breakfast that consisted of nothing enjoyable. What can you do? Karma yoga was in the dining room which was pointless because trying to mop a floor, even sweep a floor while people are constantly coming through is just as I said pointless. In fact it may have been dirtier afterwards than it was beforehand.



Our first exam is today so after yoga nidra we found the questions on the board and started working on them. And by working on them I mean I found the oages the answers were and that was food enough for me. It is clearly going to be more work than I had initially expected but it still shouldn't be bad.



Luckily to lift our spirits from a less than thrilling morning lunch was delicious and afterwards we all swapped info on what pages the answers were on. The exam took two solid hours and was a bit painful. Like literally painful, my wrist were all uncomfortable after so much writing.



Asana class afterwards was alright but what was really stellar was afterwards. Rob hadn't come to class so I went to see if he was alright. While I conversed from outside the door everyone encouraged me to break ashram rules and falling victim to peer pressure I popped on in. This rule couldn't have been broken at a better time because the boys decided Rob was going to lead us in a quick workout. I felt kind of bad because it didn't seem like he completely wanted to be doing that but he was a good sport and led us through a fifteen minute ab routine.



Can we say hilarious. Max, Rudvich and I on our backs in a small little room. Rob instructing us as to what to do. Me kicking both the guys asses as they complained about leg lifts and I surpassed the number we were suppose to do. Oh it was fabulous! I felt so great afterwards.



Quick shower before dinner, we all choked down on a lovely meal and called it an early night.



Day Thirteen



Final day of festival will be today. Despite this I am feeling sluggish and finding the days a bit monotonous. I wake up to the bell and roll out of bed and up the stairs into the dining hall where I grab my tea and chat with the tea makers. I am frequently the only person up there besides for the tea makers and today is no different.



My foot has started to feel a bit janky and like usual I'm paranoid about my food intake and lack of exercise. The days are feeling a bit monotonous despite the festivities going on. Asana class, micro lesson and karma yoga. Fortunately today I was finally in the kitchen. Unfortunately all we did was shred carrots.



Afterwards we were instructed to shower so we could enter into the sacred area of the festival so off I went to bucket shower real quick and join my peers. We all sat around as we watched Gandar feed the fire and random things went on. Ere was a slicing of a watermelons, some gift giving, food eating and flower throwing. There was also a lot of chanting and a bit of clapping. It was pretty cool but when lunch time came and passed I can't help but say my focuses strayed from worshipping Mother Earth to when is my belly getting some nourishment.



Finally the time came, after we each obtained a sweet or two, and we headed on over to grab some food. It was another delicious meal filled with salad and some sweets. It revitalized is for the two lectures on anatomy that followed.



I chose to go to chanting instead of exercise and it may be the last time I do that. I just don't really get that much enjoyment out of it and I definitely get more enjoyment after a solid work out than I do repeating the same little phrase 108 times. Especially when we do it all slow and it takes a lifetime and a half. I'm not knocking it, for some people it is probably great but for me well I guess I'm not a yogi pro that's for sure.



Dinner was a bit disappointing but hey you can't win them all. We also let the boys in on V-power which has only happened once and at this rate will never be repeated but if it is the boys wanna join.



After a quick shop run that lead to the consumption of even more sweets we all called it a night.



Day Fourteen



The heat is back. It doesn't take long for it to come around and kick our ass. Well not all of our asses. I'm pretty use to it after Thailand and find little reason to complain about it because compared to running in this weather doing a few hours of yoga is nothing.



I did however wake up late today and by late I mean 5:15. I was still up and at tea before most and I chatted with rob until he decided to go into silence. Yes there is the choice to go into a day of silence. It is a time to self reflect and what not. Personally I don't see the point in it but hey whatever floats your boat.



Asanas followed by my best micro lesson yet. I am slowly getting more and more confident and actually enjoying giving my lesson. Maybe it is all the Om chanting or there really was some energy inside the festival that could change my destiny. Perhaps I just realize that it isn't all that scary to talk in front of friends. Whatever the case I'm not about to have an anxiety attack every time I step in front if my group.



When we completed this we were off to learn one of the two cleansing techniques that we will be taught here. The two we are learning is netti and vomiting. Today we have the pleasure of pouring salt water in one nostril and have it come out the other.



First the demonstration. As it turns out there are several ways to suck water up into your. One and make it come out other places like your other nostril or mouth. While we are at it why not shove some tubes up your nose and out your mouth and scrub a little. So weird.



All we are doing is the netti so we filled up our little pot and found a nice little spot. Tipping our heads we poured the water on in and with some tweaking of the head and adjusting of the breath managed to have it come out the other nostril. Success. I feel so proud.



Not really, what I actually feel is hungry and with the festival over guess what is for breakfast. Fruit! I seriously don't know why but the papaya here is ten times better than thailands. I don't even like Thai papaya but here I'm digging in the fruit bowl trying to find as many pieces as I can.



Karma yoga time. Off to the hall I went again. Luckily the we four of us on the task this time and despite the size of the room we finished ret quickly. Gandar was lecturing today and I am so happy when it is him because he is so enjoyable to listen to.



Lunch was beet and tomato salad, mung bean salad, chipati and buttermilk. Oh how lovely. I attempted to start my project afterwards but after finding no books that I could use I instead read about my star sign. I really don't feel like a cancer when I read about it. Makes me kind of sad.



Afternoon asanas were fine but what was ten times better was Robs workout. He totally kicked out asses and it was fabulous! We had to do push-ups, lunges, squats, leg lifts and crunches 50xs each! And in between when we messed up we had to run. I wish we could do this every day!



Again we finished in time for a shower and dinner. And what better way to reward a good work out than a killer meal of potato and what reminds all of us as pasta. Oh how delightful.



Day Fifteen



Day off! It is so nice to have a day off. I really don't mind the schedule but it is good to take a day to just relax slough heading into town isn't the most relaxing thing in the world.



Although I had originally planned to run, instead I headed up the mountain to check out the sun rise. A group of us made our way up to the top and it was a spectacular view. Ok I exaggerate a little, it wasn't the most stunning sun rise but it was quite nice.



Down the mountain we went to kill some time before breakfast and heading to town. Washing clothes, cleaning the room, and looking pretty the time flew and the bell rang. Off we went to enjoy fruit again! It was so SO lovely. I ate little because today I'm indulging in some true Indian food.



There was a bit of confusion and while this was being sorted out a few of us hopped into a little store of dried fruits and nuts. While the others got their own little trail mix I picked up something ten times more fabulous, chili. I was assured that it is quite spicy and I cannot wait to try it!



We headed into town and after some confusion Kat, Cherry and I hopped in a tricycle and headed to Old City. We headed down to the river where Indians from around the country come to bath in. It was wild and I finally felt like I was in real India. I mean the ashram is technically in India but it is enclosed and the are more foreigners than Indians and the food isn't proper Indian I think you get the picture.



Out in real India was a trip! They city was packed with people hustling and bustling by. I took so many pictures of the kids jumping in the water and women cleaning clothes. The three of us got a small flower thing to release into the water, it reminded me very much of what we release in Thailand for Loy Kratong. When we went to pay, the woman upped the price from 10 to 100 and finding this outrageous we paid 20.



We found Max, Lino and Costas and walked around the old city checking out the different vendors there and taking lots of photos. At times people would ask to take photos with us especially Max. He found this all very entertaining but it is the same same in Thailand so I just tried to hop into as many random people's photos as I could.



After a bit of wandering food time came. Kat had been talking about this restaurant for awhile and I am so excited to try it! It is more of an eatery that a restaurant which makes it even better. Max expressed some concern over eating the food but after some reassurance we convinced him that he would be fine.



As we sat down I ordered up a lassi and told Kat to just order whatever she thought was tastiest. Palak paneer, mushroom masala, paneer dolce, malai kofka sweet stuff, vegetable pilaw rice, garlic naan, and paneer parota was what was brought to our table and every single item was amazing. The naan was the best I've ever had, the dips were to die for and even the rice which I originally looked upon with a bit of disdain had me coming back for more.



After filling our bellies we moved on to a near by textile shop where Kat go a lovely local shirt. And despite being stuffed we headed off for dessert. Sadly the place was closed so we hopped in a tricycle and headed back into the city.



Time to get our Internet and shopping on. Max bought a soccer ball and his eyes may have glowed even brighter after this purchase than his pizza purchase. After a bit of time running errands we headed back to the ashram.



I had every intention of running but intentions mean nothing. Instead we all chatted with Bernadette who gave us the V Power questionnaire. It was both fun and informative but when little R came by we had to shut it down.



Guess what came next. Dinner. And guess what I had. Chili. Magic is the only word to describe the burst of spice that erupted in my mouth. No scratch magic and replace it with utmost bliss or paradise maybe heaven? Yes heaven. My heaven will be filled with chili, lots and lots of chili.



Despite today being our day of rest we are all exhausted and call it a night rather early on.



Day Sixteen



Optional silence day. Yes I've decided to self induce some silence upon myself. Originally we were all suppose to be silent but this is the second time that they have cancelled and after brief consideration I decided what the hell let us be silent for the day. And by we I mean my roomie Kat and I because I think if one of us had to be silent and the other could speak, well it would hands down be much harder than it has been.



In fact it hasn't been bad at all. We decided yesterday that we were going to do it so when I awoke at the bizarrely early time of 4:45 thanks to an early ringing of the bell I grabbed the badges for the two of us and prepared myself.



Due to lack of communication tea was not served today and I can't complain. Instead of waiting around for it I went out for a quick 15 minute run and it felt amazing! I may have to do that every day it felt so great!



Asana yoga was good, it is pretty repetitive now a days but at least we do enough sun salutations to get the blood pumping just a bit. And micro lesson followed which I think gets better and better every day. I try and go first so I don't have to sit around anxiously waiting for my turn. The other ladies say I am sounding more confident and it probably is because I am more confident. I am getting more and more excited to be a teacher when I get home.



Porridge and fruit for breakfast. Sprinkle some cinnamon on it and pair it with lemongrass tea with a touch of super sweet milk and it is almost like your in heaven. Sitting outside I gazed at the beautiful scenery that surrounds me. Again the idea that I'm in India literally boggles my mind. The idea that I also can't use chili in my meal also boggles my mind but I get over that pretty quickly.



Karma yoga was cleaning the library today. The room is quite small but they assigned three people to the task. This means we got done in a hot silent second. It was as of they were all in silence making the whole cleaning thing quite boring.



When your forced to be silent it turns out you can get a lot done. Each time I was finished with whatever I would scamper back to my room and wrote my final essay in mean it had to be done but when you can't talk to people it makes it easier to choose writing over chatting.



Lecture time! It is about diet and is being given by mamma bear, or Guruji's fabulous wife ---------. I am excited to hear all about the yogi diet since I am slightly obsessed with learning new techniques for a proper diet. Instead I learned about some less than scientific facts that included the evils of coffee, tea and meat. I think I'll pass on accepting the yogi diet as a full time thing.



After learning about what foods to eat we then learned how to cook them! Off to the kitchen we went and of course today would be the day that i choose to be silent. Mamma Bear taught us multiple things including beet and carrot salad, chapatis and mixed spices. What was emphasized was the lack of chili within the mixed spices. See the ashram doesn't like chilies. It apparently creates desires we aren't suppose to have. You know what not having chili does to me? Creates desire for some freaking chilies. I think I'm going to continue smuggling the chili in.



Lunch followed and I had no problem or guilt over bring my chili up to meal time despite having just learned about all of its evil properties. I also had no problem adding it into every aspect of my meal which enhanced its wonderfulness.



The afternoon was nice. In silence I finished up my paper and than busted out my granny cross stitch. Everyone was amused by this and I couldn't quite explain what I was doing which was a bit frustrating not because I couldn't talk but because I felt ute rude. Once everyone left however I sat alone and realized this whole silent thing was a lot like days in Thailand. I is fair to say a few days went by when not a word passed my lips. At least not any words to was another person, I did find talking to myself a common practice back on Thailand. I'm not sure if that is allowed here.



Learning about yoga and pregnancy might have been good if I wasn't so exhausted. I could literally hardly keep my eyes open and found my head bobbing constantly. I'm not sure why I was so sleepy, maybe the topic was just completely not interesting to me although as a teacher I should be interested in any and all aspects of yoga.



Busting out two more hours of yoga was good. We worked on a few new poses including swan which is killer on my wrist and then a crazy balancing pose that my body absolutely hates. In fact I should probably never do it again if I want to keep my body happy, I can only cross my fingers that it won't be on the final exam. We also worked on head stand and mine is slowly getting better and better which is cool but imagining staying up for fifteen seconds sounds dreadful.



Workout time. A proper work out makes me so happy. Twenty minutes of abs, push-ups and leg workouts with Max makes the day so much better. Although to be fair they aren't the most intense work outs.



Dinner was literally painful and joyous at the same time. I poured so my chili on the soup and rice which eating it totally blew out my palate. Better yet I made the little dipping sauce that I always had in Thailand, chili sugar and some lime and dipped my veggies in it. I literally cried from the spice and it was MAGICAL.



Day Seventeen



Not optional silent day is being enforced today. Okay enforced is to strong a word, encouraged is a better one but after having one yesterday Kat and I decided that we would be a little loose on the rules. And by loose I mean completely disregard it for the most part.



I mean in the presence of others we we mostly silent but really who wants to do two days of silence. On top of that we had a writing assignment today so naturally we had to share what we were going to write about. Excuses excuses I know, we fail as ashram girls.



Anyway after tea, two hours of yoga kicked my ass. Yoga is all about body awareness and what I am learning is that my body seriously hates certain postures. I am not sure if anyone's body enjoys squatting, coming up on your heels, placing your one knee on the other and then balancing. My body tried, it really did and for a hot second I was balanced. No then my foot started to scream bloody murder and my knee began hollering just as loudly. What was the solution, switch legs. Clearly accepting ones own limitations hasn't quite sunk in yet.



Watering flowers was my karma yoga for the morning and with four people doing the task it was done twice over in no time.



This leads us to breakfast. I am so glad to be getting fruit back eac morning I appreciate it even more. The one spoonful rule is sad, I always want so much more but I suppose one scoop will do. Whatever was paired with it today lead to the usage of chili. It was some kind of couscous dish with vegetables made fabulous by chili. I don't care if chili is the devils spice or contraband or whatever I'm going to keep using it!



The morning was spent prepping for the writing exam which appears quite easy. My ore operation included lots of shavasana. The time went quickly and before we knew it the bell was ringing for lunch. I had read about Pavlov's dogs before but now I feel like I am one of the. Each time the bell rings we all perk up and immediately head for the kitchen for our meals. In fact I think every time I hear a bell I will end up doing that.



Lunch was coconut chutney with added chili and yellow soup stuff with chili and little pancakes with chili. Just kidding I didn't add chili to the pancakes but that is simply because I added enough in everything else.



After lunch I helped out my Italian friends reading what they wrote and fixing their grammar and then we all headed into class to work on our essays. Wam bam thank you ma'am and in just one hour I was walking away from that exam. Theory is much easier than technical exams and that is exactly what this one was.



One hour of asanas followed by our micro lesson.



The class went fine, but new animals were introduced to the mix. Today swan was our newest pose and I can't say I'm its number one fan. Twisting your arms, bending the elbows and going into plank, oh what fun. The fun however did come later as we got to work on wheel, which after several years of wheel being on hiatus in my life I find I can preform it alright.



As we all came together we found out that three of us were planning on doing triangle. Switching things up I ended up doing warrior. Now I prepare each of my lessons the day before because of my stage fright but with this one I had just a hot second to go over everything. Turns out that is the way I should do it. See when I plan out the lesson I plan it out in what I think is the soothing yoga style. Where as when I just act like me I use my own slang and act a bit more myself. Not the soothing calm voice but more the fun lets work out kind of way. Turns out everyone else approves of this style as well. Score!



Max and I did a quick ab work out on top of emerging else we had done today and then headed to dinner. Chapati, mung bean insala and vegetables with pineapple all of which made ten times better than none other than chili. I know mamma bear hates chili for whatever reason but I am so much happier after each meal. Sure I'm acting a but like a junky as I hide my chili powder in a coconut rehydration pack and douse my food in the forbidden spice but after two weeks without I'm using it and enjoying every spoonful.



After a visit to the shop where sweets were the main purchase I'm finally calling it an early night. Maybe a run in the morning.... Or not.



Day Eighteen



Today I learned to vomit. Yes you read correctly, vomit. But before I get to the excitement of puking let us take a quick look at the morning. Guess what I did. If you thought running, unfortunately you thought wrong. Despite waking up early due to the bell ringing earlier and earlier by the day I chose not to strap on my shoes and hit the trails. Instead I sat around drinking tea and writing in my journal.



Asana class lead to two new balancing poses and micro lesson went well with me educating the class more on the word janky than on cobra pose. By the way janky means off, weird, not right for example your arms should never be janky in cobra pose.



And then it was time. We have already accomplished one cleansing practice but vomiting seems a lot let exciting than running water through your nose. With that said I was bizarrely excited to try this technique out. It even has a fancy name, Vaman Dhouti, and is used to stimulate the abdominal organs, remove excess mucus, help respiration and release any pent up emotions, doesn't that make you all want to do it?



After watching a demonstration by one of our yoga teachers it was our turn. Nothing says bonding quite like sitting in a circle drinking enough salty water to induce vomiting. Strangely enough while everyone else complained about the salt water I didn't mind it so much. By glass eight I thought maybe and very few of us still in the circle I thought it was about time to vomit. Off I scampered to Cherry's side and the two of us vomited together. Should I get graphic? If you don't want the details skp the next paragraph.



Okay so even after eight nice and salty glasses of water I wasn't feeling the intense need to vomit. I mean there was a bit of gurgling going on and if I had kept drinking I'm sure it would have worked naturally but I was in a rush to join my friends in the cleansing process so after a few attempt and failures to vomit I stuck my finger down my throat. Yup, nothing says good yoga practice much like sticking your finger down your throat and watching as the same eight glasses of salt water you just drank came right back up. Unfortunately unlike our demonstrator I had to induce several rounds of this. But eventually most came up and out and well the rest would just have to vacate from another end.



Doing a round of netti to clean out our nasal passages we called it a morning and we sent to eat breakfast. You know what happens when you vomit? Well I don't know what happens to you, but I was starving! With a one scoop limit on fruit I couldn't help but take a little extra to compensate for the whole vomiting thing. And on top of that puff rice with potatoes and you guessed it some chili!



Once again I was instructed to clean the main hall. It isn't hard work but its a big room and boring job. I would seriously love to get into the kitchen again but I guess I'll just have to wait and see I mean it is karma yoga so I shouldn't be desiring anything specific I guess.



After several days without it, yoga nidra has been reintroduced into our lives. I didn't think I was that exhausted until I passed out just a few minutes into the session and for once didn't wake up when we were suppose to. Oh how lovely and refreshed I now feel.



We have self study time now for working on our essay but after being silent for two days I am finished and just rocking out to some good old American music while writing up this little entry and contemplating as to whether or not a good work out should be done.



I ended up banging out a quick thirty minute work out and I'm glad I did because lunch was fabulous and I felt no guilt indulging. Just a smidge of rice with carrot salad, cabbage salad, yellow mushy stuff, different yellow mushy stuff and butter milk. Oh it was divine and guess what made it better. CHILI! Oh and peanuts, which when sprinkled with a bit of lime juice and a dash of chili turned out to be a fabulous treat.



With my essay done i spent the afternoon listening to everyone around me get all deep about self realization. Instead of participating I enjoyed my granny activity of cross stitching. With my shawl covering my bare scandalous shoulders and my glasses poised at the end of my pierced nose all I needed was a rocking chair and a cat by my side to complete the look.



For the afternoon lecture we learned about lesson planning which then lead into our asana class. Today I learned how to roar like a lion. Propped up in an absurdly uncomfortable position all of us took one deep inhale and with all the vigor we could muster roar just sorta not at all like a lion but you can't say we didn't try.



Acting like a lion wasn't the only thing we learned today. Fast breathing was again on the agenda. Theses breathing techniques tend to be harder than most of the asanas for me. I lose track of which nostril I'm suppose to breath out of and which to breath in from. Then I just get all confused and end up blocking off both nostrils at once or squishing my nose piercing to hard which as it turns out is a tad painful.



Lastly we learned a sun salutation that puts all sun salutations to shame. Bends and squats, warriors and cobras, plank, chatarunga, plank, side plank, chatarunga, cobra oh a whole mess of things that felt fabulous! If we could do about ten of those a day I would be happy.



Max and I attempted a quick work out but I just didn't have it in my to go balls the wall and mostly just laid on the ground. Besides there was very little time in between the work out and dinner and we all know food is almost always on my mind. Sure this isn't very yogi of me but lets face it I'm not trying to be a yogi master. With that in mind I also dumped chili all over my meal once more. How can one little spice bring me such joy. I'm totally breaking ashram law as well as a Yama by having major possessive desires towards my chili powder.



Although I would have loved to slip into bed at 8pm we happened to have a Q&A tonight. This Q&A consisted of few questions, long winded answers and several stories. We still ended a bit early but somehow I never manage to take advantage of this. Instead I sat outside with the boys as Rob played guitar and we stared up at the stars. It was nice, much more memorable than hitting the sack right away.



Day Nineteen



What the hell ran through my head as the alarm went off. It is only the second time here that that has happened and really shows how tired I am getting. I mean I guess not everyone can function on seven hours of sleep, five hours of exercise and Indian heat.



Off I went to get my tea and attempt to mentally prepare for my micro lesson. Today we aren't just teaching one asana, no today we are doing the grand daddy of micro lessons, sun salutations. Mentally preparing lasted about ten seconds until other people joined me and I found talking more interesting than reading.



Asanas were quick today because we our micro lesson is going to take a bit longer. We learned nothing new when it comes to asanas but we did learn some new breathing techniques. More inhaling and exhaling while squishing your nose piercing.



Theses fast breathing techniques all seem a bit funny to me but they are suppose to have quite a few benefits such as oxygenating our vital organs, get rid of mucus, improve our digestion and increase our Prana. Oh Prana, we do so much for this vital energy we apparently all have.



Slow breathing was next. This reduces our heart rate and respiration rate and will increase our life span. Who doesn't want to do that? So inhaling for four beats then exhaling for eight, switching up the nostril as we go.



Off to micro lesson we all went. Sure we do about thirty sun salutations a day and we should all have it semi memorized but we never had to teach it. I went first. I have gotten much more comfortable with my presentations but I still like going first and getting it over with especially since my foot has started to bother me again. Stupid foot, it just isn't use to so much stretching and I've started taping the sucker up. I really REALLY don't want to wear Boot again.



Anyway off I went on my speal about sun salutations and I did my demo and then another and the a third because it turns out there is a hell of a lot to say. Here is the ideal pose, variations, benefits, dos and don't, breathing oh many it isn't even funny how much you have to say. It went smoothly enough with a mix up here and there but overall it was fine, although I did forget a few things.



We all ended right at breakfast time so we grabbed our plates and hit the dining hall. Fruit and a mung bean salad. Oh that salad is so tasty. And can you ever go wrong with fruit? The answer is no!



Today is going to be a long day. We have four lectures planned out starting with Guruji. I'm sure his lectures are interesting but since I'm typing this instead I can't be certain. The problem is he literally reads everything from the book, almost nothing is new and his accent is a bit stronger and at times hard to understand.



Thankfully the next lecture was much better. Given by a scientist he delved into the whole chakra idea. I myself am a bit skeptical. And by a bit I mean totally but I listened to what he said and found both him and the topic very interesting. But I am still skeptical.



I was also quite tired. Despite how interesting he was I had a hard time staying awake. Luckily lunch was afterwards and oh what a stupendous lunch it was. I'm going to shock you by saying I needed next to no chili at all. Mung bean salad, carrot salad, parata, rice with peanuts, tomato curry and mashed potatoes. Oh what sweet sweet joy.



A long lecture followed which was interesting but I constantly find it hard to focus on things I don't have much interest in. Can't we just do 100 sun salutations? Oh we can. Okay not 100 but we did 24 in asana class and I may have been the only one enjoying it. I can't help that I find a heart race increase exciting. Max and I worked out again. Seriously so much better than chanting. I did a Pilates class while he did his thousand crunches and then it was dinner time.



I wish we could call it an early night but instead we have meditation. I thought this might be enjoyable but my leg was bothering me so I really couldn't meditate at all which is quite unfortunate. I suppose better luck next time.



Day Twenty



I found out I have a blue and yellow Ora. How you ask? Well turns out Sabrina, on top of everything else, sees Ora's. what's this mean? Apparently the yellow means I think a lot which is true and the blue means I have some healing qualities. I guess that is pretty cool. Learning something new every day rit?



the morning proceeded as usual. I grabbed tea, had asana class that didn't include that many asanas and then micro lesson. I was more than unprepared, I had just looked at the lesson that morning. Fortunately I hardly care what happens because everyone is fabulous and besides today was on breathing and that is the least interesting part for me. This was out last micro lesson, next week is the real deal so maybe I should have taken it seriously. Oops.



Breakfast was lovely fruit and I must admit some delicious rice. It has boiled peanuts in it and seriously that alone makes it great. Add chili in it better. How tired of reading about chili are you? Just imagine being my roommates when I didn't have chili and all I did was talk about how much better the food would be with it!



Karma in the dining room was a lot more successful this time around with nobody coming in to eat. We actually mopped the floor and kept it sparkling at least for awhile.



Lectures continued by Paresh. H is really interesting but my mind is constantly wandering. It is hard to take a scientist seriously when he is talking about the moon and sun nadis flowing through the body. I did start paying attention again when we all had to blow on a mirror which would show which chakra was activated. As it turns out I'm dead because the mirror registered nothing. Just kidding it is just way to hot for a mark to be made.



I would have kept trying but the bell rang and I inched my way to the door as I waited for actual dismissal. Doesn't he know not to keep 30 plus people who instantly respond to a bell for food away from our reward.



Lunch was stupendous. We have been on a serious role of just amazing food. Not that the food is ever bad but the options given are just amazing.



Paresh is interesting and all but he delayed us from food and is now taking away an hour of our relax time. So we all meander on back to the hall and pop a squat to learn about quantum healing. You know how much I knew about quantum physics before, nothing. You know how much I know now? Nothing. But I did nearly finish a corner of my cross stitching. It isn't like I wasn't pay attention it was just confusing and well okay seriously I don't quite think yoga is the cure to cancer.



What I did pay attention to was the fact that he can read palms and we can send a photo in and he will do just that. I look forward to when I get to do that. Kat had the good fortune of asking home a question about emailing him and right there and then he read her palm and it was a great reading. Fun fact ladies, if your ring finger is shorter than your pointer than you are fertile. Guess whose finger is not shorter than her pointer, this girl! Score.



Asana class was fine. I held crow, roared like a lion, balanced as a swan and even managed to get my feet up in head stand. All of that is pretty ballet but seriously I'm going to walk away from here more injured than my three a days ever did. Wrist, knees, foot I'm a mess.



Even though I'm falling apart, Max and I did a quick ab work out. I think our ab work outs consist of more laughing and talking than working out but that is ok. He wears a Feng Shui necklace that he told me protects him. He later demonstrated how it works by throwing me off balance and then making me wear the necklace and being unable to throw me off balance. I don't know if it had anything to do with the necklace or the fact that I knew he was going to try it again but I went with it.



Tis is when I also learned about my Ora which is really interesting. I don't know if I believe in it or not but it was cool to hear the explanations and such. Even more interesting to know that our Ora's change. If it is all legit I wonder if that is all Sabrina sees, just big fuzzy colors surrounding all of us.



After dinner we learned a but about Lord Krishnu and Arjuno, a story about a war between families over a kingdom. Arjuno and his four brothers represent good and their 100 cousins represent bad. Arjuno wanted to throw down his arms instead of fighting his family and asks Krishnu what he should do. In the end Arjuno naturally kicks some ass and tomorrow we will learn a bit more about how everything went down



Calling it an early night and it feels so good to do so!



Day Twenty One



Three weeks down and just one to go. I woke up nice and refreshed from a fabulous nights sleep and hit the kitchen for some tea. There was a bit of a delay due to lack of gas for boiling water, but when it was produced it was nice and tasty.



It is silence day... Again. So the morning I sat and read. I've started The Red Tent and really enjoy it thus far.



Asana class was quite brief this morning because half way through Paresh came on in and we did a meditation class again. I don't know if I'm meditating wrong or what but I just kind of get bored and start twiddling my toes and wishing I could go and read the Red Tent.



My karma for the morning was sweeping the path from kitchen to office with Costas. It is a shame we are in silence because I don't know Costas at all and this would have been a good opportunity to chat with him. Just another thing I find silly about silence day.



Breakfast was museli and fruit, can you really go wrong? And from there we got the questions to our final written exam.



Up until this point we were all pretty good, as in we were all pretty silent. But seriously putting three chicks in a room for hours to work on the same project. Come on now. I think we lasted a total of three seconds before we broke silence and discussed what we were planning to write.



We are mostly lesson planning for this exam. I've decided to make my old people do sun salutations for thirty minutes. Just kidding! The exam is a breeze. I mean when you know the questions beforehand and have four hours to prep how could they not be. My hand hurts from all the writing though.



Day Twenty Two



Day off is always so nice when it comes around. I am always shocked when a whole week has gone by and we are allowed out and about once more. I wanted so badly to run but Max pinky swore we would run in the evening and despite firmly believing we wouldn't I choose to exercise with a workout video instead. Oh running is going to be rough when I get back.



Breakfast and then off we went. First stop Internet cafe where we all spent time catching up with emails and Facebook and whatever else we needed to catch up on. Easily bored by the Internet both Max and I hit up Big Bizarre for a hot second before we all headed to lunch.



Kat and Pat being experts in Indian cuisine, at least compared to Max and I ordered up an array of delicious food. A basket of all the different types of bread, garlic nan, plain, chapati ect. With it a spinach dip, a mushroom paneer dip some veggie dip and a vegetable and chili dip thing. So good, all of it. And paired with a lassi was so fantastic, I as so full afterwards to say the least.



So full that as we meandered back to the office we all stopped at the dried fruits and nuts shop to buy more snacks and then picked up an iced coffee. It has been twenty two days since my last coffee. I'm not really counting, it's easy to figure out when each day is labelled and to be honest I haven't been craving it. With that said, the coffee was off the chain delicious and I have I regrets breaking the no caffeine rule.



At the office we realized we still had time before the taxi arrived so the only logical thing to do was to go back to the shop and pick up chikku juice. Chikku is this weird little fruit that we get on occasion in our fruit salad in the morning and it is delicious. As it turns out, so is chikku juice.



Finally we all piled into the van and headed home to the ashram. It was nice coming back early and relaxing out at the picnic tables. We just chatted about this that and the other and indulged on the nuts we had just bought.



Time flies when your relaxing and having fun because before we knew it it was nearly sunset and we all decided to head up the hill to check it out the first time wasn't all that spectacular but this one certainly made up for it.



The sunset was beautiful. While it was going down a few of us had a yoga photo shoot, each of us posing with the sun setting behind us. Maybe a little corny but it was all good and quite adorable.



Eventually we all sat down and just enjoyed the sunset. With just a smidge of light left we made our way back down the mountain for dinner.



Day Twenty Three



Breathing exam, asana exams, essays and lessons. That is the name of the game this week because as crazy as it sounds it is the last week. I seriously can't believe it, time has flown by. No more asana class, no more lectures, all we have left are what we will be graded on.



First up, Pranayama exam which will be judging how well we breath. Yes breath in different ways and make bumble bee sounds and lock our abs and best yet how we pour water through our nose and then shake our heads like elephants. Yes you read that all correctly.



After tea and a discussion on the proper way to lock ones abs and finding that I have serious issues doing just that we all headed over, grabbed our spots and waited for the breathing to begin.



Just like our asana exam we were divided into groups and waited for our turn to preform whatever task that examiner was marking. Acting like a bumblebee and the a bumblebee who had sucked in helium was task number one and turns out I make a great bumblebee. Ab locking didn't go nearly as well but I tried. What did to exceptionally well, in fact e best it has ever gone was netti. Turns out I'm becoming an expert at pouring water through my nose. None of it dribbled down my cheek like usual or came out my mouth or nearly choked me nope it flowed in a nice and steady manner.



There was no karma this morning because today we learned how to creat our final lesson and the groups we would be in. My group is pretty stellar and I decided to get everything over with so I'm going on the first day. That us definitely something new for me, normally I would want to be last but now I'm stepping up with a bit of confidence.



The afternoon was spent lesson planning until I decided to start working on my head stand. We don't have to do it in our final but I want to. I have to hold it for thirsty seconds which sounds so short until you are on your head. I practiced and felt confident although a smidge of me was still nervous.



Finally it was time to start. The asanas we started with were easy but eventually the time came. When our examiner asked who was doing the head stand I put my hand up and got ready. Not jumping off my toes, I slowly lifted my body up and although I didn't straighten it as much as I could have I stayed up for the thirty seconds BALLER. After that I conquered crow and wheel and feel as thought the exam went pretty great overall.



Up the mountain we all went to enjoy the sunset before dinner and celebrate the beginning of the end.



Day Twenty Four



Trial lesson start

Karma micro lesson

Afternoon lesson went well

Workout w max

Carrot salad?

Shop open

Rakki on my knee



Day Twenty Five



Aikkiko and Choi have their lessons this morning and although they were a smidge nervous they both banged out fabulous lessons. Once they were done we were done with lessons for the day. It totally pays to have six people in a group!



Essays in the morning including my own which although I started out nervous eventually got my groove and banged out ten minutes with no problems at all.



Whether it is due to the carrot salad, heat or stress there are quite a few people feeling sick today included with them my boys Rob and Max. I feel for them, it sucks to feel like crap during exam week but at least they really aren't missing much excitement.



With an afternoon off I wasn't sure what to do. The answer came when Kat decided we should do henna. One of the ladies in the kitchen does henna so after a quick scheduling, we fixed a time, grabbed Kat's henna cone and brought it up.



Kat was first to go and the decide was beautiful. There was still a lot of cone left so then I went and if I do say so myself mine was a bit prettier. And then kathrine managed to be walking by and we fetched her to get some done as well.



Still there was a lot of ink left in the cone and Katherine didn't want to waste anything so off she went on a creative whirl wind starting with Kat's foot. A lovely little garden scene including flowers and a butterfly filled Kat's food but still there was ink left. So I asked for her to cover up my tattoo with a tree to see what that might look like.



My tattoo is on the left side of my back so when I felt the cool henna pen on my spine I was a bit confuse to say the least. I was wondering how big this tree was going to be and once I realized that it wasn't covering the tattoo at all it was too late.



A mural was being designed on my back, one that included bumble bees and snakes and most importantly a squirrel. It is quite hilarious and ridiculous but a good laugh and a fun time. I just hope it doesn't last three weeks!



Nothing to do in the afternoon so I planned a little for my final tomorrow afternoon and then just relaxed, trying to keep my henna from smudging. Before dinner I did some exercise and then headed up for a meal I strangly wasn't hungry for. But I'm always hungry I thought.



The evening session was brief, mostly just to try and tell us all not to stress before our finals tomorrow and to let us know that Ghandar is leaving in two days. Kind of sucks he won't be there for our ceremony but what can you do?



Calling it an early night!



Day Twenty Six



While I sat around chatting with friends this morning I noticed something, no Pat. Since he is almost always at tea time AND had his final this morning I found this especially unusual n when rumor spread that he too was ill I thought that perhaps I would be getting done with my own lesson this morning. Sure I wasn't really prepared, I had only looked at one of my postures once and I didn't even know my preparatory movement and forget the mantras but hey getting it over with might be worth and unprepared lesson.



Kathrin rocked it out and then there was a lull as we wondered what to do. I asked for ten minutes to whip up my lesson plan and then began. I wasn't to nervous considering I didn't have a whole lot of time to allow myself to feel nervous. Off I went in the unnatural calm voice that is required of a yoga teacher. Sure during micro lessons I had learned that my spunky upbeat energetic voice was a nice niche in the calm yoga atmosphere here but since I was being graded on a soothing voice I tried to tone it down and leave out words such as janky. It want really me, and I would never in a million years teach a lesson like this but hey it wasn't half bad for being half prepared and better yet I AM DONE!!!



Katherine and I danced around the room rejoicing to being done with everything. Not that there was a whole lot of pressure on us before, but now there is none at all. It feels so nice to breath a sigh of relief. This now gives me a whole forenoon to just shut off the brain instead of trying to learn mantras I will never say again.



Since we were done early I got a quick work out in before breakfast. Old kitchen was my karma and then there were more essays where I just cross stitched while listening to all the essays. The last day of essays and to be fair everyone's was pretty interesting.



Lunch bell rings and we all flock to the kitchen to enjoy some of the last meals we will be getting here at the ashram.



And afternoon of relaxation plus a half hour of good old yoga nidra which had exited our lives far to early especially during exam time when we need it most. Tow more lessons this afternoon given by Janelle and Pat, both who have been sick but managed to pull our great lessons.



Again because we have a nice small class we ended early. I had intended to climb the mountain with Max but couldn't find him so Pilates seemed like the only logical choice so that is what I did before dinner.



After dinner a crazy drumbeat circle dance sesh broke out. It was so much fun. The boys started banging on the bongos and later a whole crew was in there banging out beats while a handful of us danced around like fools. It was a great time to say the least!



Hitting up the shop to pay a ridiculous bill that I don't even know how I incurred and then to listen to some music before hitting up the bed.



Day Twenty Seven





Lesson in the am. It is the last go of them and then we are done. Crazy! After tea we all sat through those last two lessons of our yoga teaching training and two hours later we were sort of free. I have to say how great my group is again. The people and our examiner who was just so nice and encouraging.



Breakfast as delicious but because I was headed into town I tried not to stuff my face knowing I would be doing that for lunch. We piled more than usual into a taxi and headed out



In Nashik our usual first stop was Internet bit we were only there for a hot second because food was far more important. We meandered around for a bit looking for a new place to hit up and eventually we found a nice little restaurant. Kat ordered up for us once more and the food as always was tasty although there was a bit of language barrier so each dip came out at a different time.



Max and I headed back to the office and just kicked it there for awhile until everyone else showed up and we headed back. It was nice to relax and by relax I mean do some Pilates before heading up to see the sunset once more.



The evening was packed with dinner, a drum circle, chanting and one of the girl putting on a traditional Indian dance performance. It was a great way to end the last night with everyone.



Day Twenty Eight



It is officially our last day and I can't believe it. Truly where does the time go. I'm not alone in thinking that the time flew by. Just the other day I felt like I was sleeping in the Mumbai airport, being awaken by Indians to see a white dude walking towards me. Little would I know that Rob would become one if my closest friends here and in all honestly make me feel like I've known him far longer than just this one month.



It is just the beginning of the day, 5:18 to be exact. Naturally I am awake but not for tea, instead it is because we are all hiking up the hill this morning before sunrise with the intention of doing our final yoga session together, as the sun rises.



The ceremony will be taking place today, we will be receiving our certificates that show we have completed the course and are officially teachers. From there far to many people from my yogi family will head out to continue their journeys onward or back home. Few stragglers will be left behind to enjoy the ashram, but it certainly won't be the same without people such as Rob, Cherry and so many others.



We headed up the hill to enjoy the last sunrise together and it did us proud. Although there was talk of 108 sun salutations we called it at 24, I'm pretty sure I was the only one upset with this. We replaced the rest of those sun salutations with many many photo shoots that did make up for it in the end.



When the heat started to hit we walked on down and prepared to get ready for our ceremony. All the ladies decided to get dolled up, two of them even came is saris but it wasn't easy. There has only been two mornings where the water stopped and guess when the second day was. For some reason however the boys had water so Cherry and I grabbed some from them and managed a quick shower.



The ceremony was quite nice. Ghandarji, who has been sick, ended up performing it with his father giving a nice speech as well. It was graduation style to a T as we all went up to receive our certifications and get our photo taken with it. It is official, I am a teacher!



After lunch some people headed out and the others headed to the caves. It was sad to say goodbye to Cherry and Rob but I'm excited for them to enjoy the next leg of their journey.



The caves were cool. They were cut into a huge mountain and has lots of Buddhist cut outs in the side of them. After that we hit up Panchivati where strangers treated us like celebrities. For the first time I got some street food and it was great. I don't really know what it was but the first thing was spicy and the second one just delicious.



The time came to head back and Max and I hit up one more sunset before going to dinner where we were spoiled with one of our favorite meals here in the ashram. It was a good last night. There has been a change of plans because tomorrow I am headed into town and staying with the Italians for the night and then off to Mumbai. Can't believe India is nearly over for me!

Today was to be ours official first day of A&K tour. We were scheduled to meet our tour guide Vishtal at 11am. After another wonderful buffet breakfast at the Taj we first wondered around the neighborhood of the hotel and got back by the appointed time. All of the other agents soon assembled and it really looks like a nice group. not surprisingly we soon associated ourselves with another Jewish couple, Robert and Ruth price from Chicago. again I am the only agent with a Y chromosome.

Our schedule for today was to do two site visits at the Oberoi and the Taj, with lunch at the OberoI and dinner at the taj. In between we were to take a driving tour of Bombay. We had a big air conditioned (thank G-d) bus for only 20 people. We drove across the tip if town to the Oberon and were greeted by the general manager. He told us about the history of the hotel.. It was also bombed in the terrorist attack. We then visited all of the different type rooms including the presidential suite. It was most impressive. very modern and stark and surprisingly quiet. I had never seen rooms the size of these suites with wonderful views of the water and the queens necklace promenade around the hotel. After the tour we had an Italian lunch hosted by the hotel.

We then started our city tour. In addition to our A&K tour leader we also had a local guide, a woman soho is fabulous. Tremendous knowledge of history, religion and Indian society. We first spent an hour in the house of mahatma ghandi. Wonderful pictures and you really got to understand his important role in world history. The guide put him in the same grOup as Martin Luther king, and Nelson Mandela in that they did not only speak for equality but acted. We then drove around the city seeing the house of obami the richest Han in world and the tatas. Ended the one of the museums (prine of wales), but by then we were very hot and dripping and not so interested in the art. Back to hotel by 5 pm in time for wonderful showers.

At 7 we were to meet for tour of the Taj Palace. Susan generally avoid these tours but joined the group. This is literally the most luxurious hotel imaginable. Rooms ranged from luxury city view to presidential suite. The two most interesting were the Ravi Shenker suite (3 floors high) with three bedrooms and a massive living room to the presidential suite which takes up a full wing of hotel on top floor. Obama, David Cameron and many heads of state have stay red there. In fact bill Clinton was there last week. It is incredible... Comes with a conference room, three bedrooms, a full workout room with two massage tables, and two full time butlers. We were served champagne and horses ovaries and to a person we all felt it was the most impressive suite tyet had ever seen. Just in case you are interested rack rate is about 10000 used per night. Our taxpayers at work. Day ended with hosted buffet dinner at the Taj. Food has been excellent. Tomorrow elephanta island and then flight to udaipur.

Let me tell you something..... it is very hot here..... 92 F today....

Our plan for today was to forgo a private airconditioned car and driver and to use taxis to get around. Daniel met us at about 10 and we began planning our day. We were to visit a number of temples and historic sites in Mumbai. Much more interesting than we might have imagined. Taxis are quite an experience here.... believe it or not there seem to be more taxis than in NY. Apparently two types the Blue and White are air conditioned (and not very common) and the Yellow and Black not air conditioned and barely driveable. What was interesting is that only about half of them have side view mirrors. One cannot tell if the side view mirror helps or not because we kept our eyes closed most of the time. The streets look like they are normal two lane streets... but somehow the drivers make them three lanes... the right, the left and squeezing between the two. Horns are blowing constantly because not only are there the cars (mainly taxis) on the streets, but also motorbikes (with an average of 2.4 people on each... most without helmets, and then the brave folks trying to cross the streets.... Please pray for them.

The first temple we stopped at was the Hare Krishna temple. Not surprisingly we met many monks and others.. all bald except for a little tuft of hair on the back. Lots of prayers were being said and folks prostating themselves all over. I told one of the monks that I new the Krishna song.... Hare Krishna... Hare Krishna.... and have met many of them at airports throughout the world. He was seemingly unimpressed with my knowledge of the religion. Next we stopped at the home of Mahatma Ghandi, but did not spend long here because we would visit again with out tour. After leaving there we went to the Jain Temple which was absolutely beautiful. The people we met were amazingly friendly and loved talking about their learning.

We had a wonderful lunch at a restaurant on one of the main streets. The food has been fabulous. I asked the waiter to decide what i should eat and he came through with a chicken mughta and a rice dish along with some great breads and a major large kingfish beer. the bill for three of us was about the equivalent of $25. After lunch we visited the hanging gardens which overlook the city and then off to a Jewish cemetary in the city where many of the Bagdaghi Jews are buried. Mom was very upset because the care of the cemetery was virtually non-existant.

By the end of a full day of travel we are soooooo exhausted but have loved every minute of our time here. When we got back to our palace, Daniel and I hung around to chat about his business and Susan went up to shower. We both fell asleep for a short time before it was time for cocktails in the lounge. Today it was an Indian Merlot for mom and a gin martini followed by a gin and tonic for me. After Akim carried me upstairs we watched a bit of CNN.. worried about the southern california fires... and finished off the day.

Tomorrow we start our tour..... Our tour guide called us and told us we would meet at 11am, have lunch at the Oberoi and then dinner at the Taj. A day of formal touring and meeting our group of agents. Later, everyone.

Many of the synagogues in Bombay were built by and/or supported by a family of Bagdadi Jews named the Sasoons. He not only gave freely to Jewish causes but also to children and health care. One of the most beautiful synagogues was one called the Kenneseth Eliyahoo which had beautiful interiors. We also say the oldest synagogue in Mubai, the Shaar Harahamim (Gates of Mercy Synagogue which was built in 1796 by I can't remember his name but he was a Bene Israeli. This was a group of people who lived in India who had strange practices such as Bris Milah, kosher food, shabbos... but were not part of the world Jewish world. More recently the rabbis in Israel now consider them full Jews. Interestingly while living in India for about two thousand years they experienced no anti semitism and were allowed to practice their customs freely. Another synsague was the Magen David Synagogue (maybe named after me).... it is a tall building and very well maintained and also has the Sassoon Children's school, a mikvah and a matzo baking building on the same property.

During the day we also saw the Victoria Terminas which is one of the largest train stations in the world. It was truly a beautiful building. India has an amazing train system which has developed over hundreds of years. During the day Daniel also took us to a vegetarian restaurant in Bombay. There are no formally Kosher restaurants here, but the rabbis from israel has said that Jews are permitted to eat in the purely vegetarian restaurants. Most of the people of the Maharrashta state normall have a vegetarian diet in any case. I had the super deluxe thali for lunch which is essentailly a big dish that has a number of different things in it. There was brown stuff, red stuff, yellow stuff and something made with soft cheese. All of the food was delicious. Mom had a red thing made with potatoes, and a venetarian rice biryani. we also had nan and some crunchy bread.

In the afternoon we also got to visit the Dobi Ghat, which apparently is a unique feature of Bombay. The dhobi is a traditional laundry man who collects peoples dirty linen, washes it and returns it to you. The launries are called ghats... row upon row of concret wash pens each fitted with its own flogging stone. The place we saw had almost two hundred dhobis and their families working together.

The final thing to note about today is the amazing amount of poverty we saw as we drove through this city of 18 million people. Some families were living in what looked at large crates with young children running around outside with lots of goats and dogs. Interestingly the looked pretty happy... though that is hard to imagine.... I don't think that I would be happy there.

After getting back to the hotel... we were exhausted and both took a nap before going to cocktail hour and a light dinner.

will tell you more tomorrow..... later dudes

Before I write about our first day in Bombay, I must tell you all about the Taj Palace Hotel where we are staying. I think that I mentioned that we were upgraded to a suite with butler service. What I did not say (because I did not know) is that everything is done for you. It is impossible to open a door yourself... someone appears from nowhere... and doors are opened. I decided to take a bath this afternoon after our day touring and before I knew it the butler was rubbing my back.... it is really something. In our upgraded package, we not only get a full buffet breakfast but also at 330pm we get high tea... others without this package only get low tea... At 530 we are invited to a reception with drinks and horses ovaries, and at 930 cognac and chocolates. I will not be able to take mom to any holiday inn ever again.

Now for our day. We were to meet our guide at 10am in the main lobby of the hotel. The only thing that I knew about his was that he was to be wearing jeans. We got to the lobby at 930am and it looked like a jean convention... everyone in jeans. There were tour guides all around looking for their people. Finally this young man came in.... and immediately we knew that this guy was ours.... and sure enough... he came up to us and said David... and I said Daniel... and then we hugged and said shalom. Daniel had a full day planned for us. I should tell you one thing about Bombay or Mumbai or whatever.... it is bloody hot here. Thank goodness Daniel had a car which was air conditioned and with a driver who never smiled or spoke a word resembling any language that I had ever heard. This day was planned to visit Jewish Bombay and we saw five of the seven synagogues. None of them are in any area resembling a Jewish neighborhood because Daniel noted that the few number of Jews who live here are all spread out. One of the synagogues holds a daily minyan and three have services on shabbos only. They all gave me the honor of opening the ark and holding one of the sefer torahs. It was quite moving. Security around the synagogues was very high although Daniel noted very little anti-semitism exists here is spite of a fairly large Muslim population. I had written a long posting for today... but somehow it got lost.. so I will continue this tomorrow morning. Have a good day.... it is very hot here... did I mention that???

Today was primarily an airport and travel day. Not much going on in Narita. Pretty misty and the hotel pretty far from anything so we decided to take off to the airport early in the day. Our flight was not until noon so we hung out at the ana lounge with David pretty much gorging himself on both food and drink. Got to Facebook with the Philly kohls and the SB abrams.

When we went over to gate 57 for our flight it looked pretty quiet. The flight was held up for about 10 minutes while waiting for a small group of dignitaries who were rushed to the plane. The 737 700 was an interesting experience. It had 6 rows of business class seats and 5 rows of coach. The call this their business jet. It was like flying on a private jet.

after landing in Bombay (turns out that most of the people like that better than Mumbai, turns out that our plane parked at gate 55 which based on the walk to immigration was actually in Jakarta. Finally made it through immigration and customs and we were met with the friendly A&K sign held by sayid who drove us to our first stop at the Taj Palace hotel. On the way we found a Citibank ATM and since I had no idea what the money is here, I took out 2000 things which according to Sayid is about 400 USD

From There it was off to our home for the next 4 nights. Security is amazing aroun here...it's like Israel. Cars stopped before getting into hotel and everything going through X-ray. Remember this was the hotel that. Was bombed a few yearafoot. Lovely greeting and we were led to our room which turns out too be a suite with butler service. A sitting room, two bathrooms, a bedroom and two televisions. It's now 11pm here. We ate plenty on plane and decided to just stop at a small coffee show for a sandwich. Turned out to be Starbucks, and a real hangout for local teens. Back too our room now. I think.I need to call my butler to tuck us in. Until tomorrow, when we meet Daniel for our first tour.

Our final stop in India is Mumbai, or as the British named it, Bombay. Our first excursion in this major city visits the night market at Pydhonie which is really the shops along the major shopping street. Our guide explains that the nice looking shops in buildings have the real brand name goods while the street vendors have the knockoffs. The prices tell the difference. Our drive to the Cinema Hall passes Victoria Terminus (the magnificent British built train station), the High Court and the Gateway of India. This latter Arc d’ Triumph like edifice on the waterfront’s Marine Drive was the location where Gandhi returned to India in 1915 and where the British left the country after granting them independence. We watch 20 minutes of a Bollywood movie which has everything – action, drama, love scenes – except a plot. Then it’s on to a “trendy bar” (which turns out to be a staid hotel bar with a loud DJ) and back to the ship. The next day we return to the city to visit some of the religious icons of the city including the Guruvayur and Ram Temples, the Swaminarayan Temple and the Bomanji Wadia Fire Temple. Also included is the Haji Ali Mosque and, after lunch, the Keneseth Eliyahoo Synagogue. Each of the temples is different in their approach to the worshipping of the gods but each uses flames and water to purify with an inner sanctum tended by a monk or team of monks. Many have porcelain idols and lots of silver and gold decoration. The Synagogue is painted a sky blue with historic objects on display.

Finally we again tour the city with this time the emphasis being on contemporary buildings and sites. We learn, while seeing Victoria Station up close, that local trains run every 2 minutes and stop for only 17 seconds. The slums (ala “Slum Dog Millionaire”) are of people moving to the city without being able to find housing and that the movie was shot on a set. Drivers of motorbikes are the only ones required to wear a helmet and not the two passengers on board. Driving in India appears to require guts, aggression, skill and luck with traffic lights as a guide.. There are22 official languages to conduct business, depending on the state you’re in with 1600 dialects. Hindi and English are the countrywide languages. The Hanging Gardens are actually a lovely park with well-maintained gardens over a reservoir. The Prince of Wales Museum contains artifacts he collected over a period of time and include Chinese porcelain jars, Gainsborough paintings, natural history stuffed animals and birds, early native cultural icons, ancient weapons with a marvelous collection of swords and daggers. One final visit to the arch and we return to our ship for departure that night. Interestingly, over 470 passengers arrived at the airport simultaneously and had to be processed before departure. Their bags had to be screened at the airport, transported to the port, loaded aboard and delivered to the rooms. Since this was an embarkation port, where some people are boarding for this leg of the trip and others are returning from a trip to the Taj Mahal in Delhi, the entire crew is involved in the process. Of course, those of us remaining on the ship wish to be fed and our rooms cleaned, so you can imagine the cooperation which must take place to take care of the 700 passengers. Then it’s off to the Straits of Hormuz and Dubai . The next morning we have our boat drill (normally held before leaving port) and a security drill as to what precautions we take if threatened by pirates. Both are handled professionally with the captain carefully explaining each step and what our responsibilities would be. At noon today a non US military helicopter flew close by and was shortly followed by a French jet aircraft flyover. At least the seas are calm and our cruise continues.

Greeting......... has a year gone by since Adventure before Dementia India 2012, it would appear so.

Well the dementia is still being held at bay by the adventure so here we go for a quick fix of the drug which is India.

My plan for this year was a 5 week stint of Bangladesh but due to some political unrest out there Dhaka and the rest of BD will have to wait for a better time.

As luck would have a friend said that he was thinking of going to India for a few weeks and I have managed to piggy back my way into his plans.

Oh, that would be Mark by the way.

The plan Mumbai (Bombay), Aurangabad (for Ellora and Ajanta). Nagpur (for Pench NP), Jabalpur, Chirakoot,Khajuraho, Orcha,Gwalior and Delhi.

Will try to blog a bit and drop in a few photos.

Love to All



Namaste
