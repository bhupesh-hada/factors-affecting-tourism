0," There were only waiting list seats available,",0
1,"In Ankola I stayed at the Radha Krishna Lodge which is across the road from the bus station and had a relatively amusing name,",1
2, upon arrival in the town I had to spend half an hour walking through the streets just trying to find an ATM that worked.,0
3, All the cheap hotels seemed to be closed for the night.,0
4, I drove around in a little taxi for a while looking for somewhere that was open.,1
5, One was 1600 rupees and had cockroaches literally just running about on the bed; the guy just shrugged when I pointed that out.,0
6, Eventually I ended up at a crappy place called the New Shalimar Hotel which was still too expensive (1000 rupees per night) but it was 3am by this time and I needed to sleep!,0
7, At least with this hotel I could pay for my stay with my credit card and they had WIFI.,1
8,The nearest train station to my hotel was the Sandhurst Road Station.,1
9,To fill in the day I took a taxi from by the train station to the Byculla Zoo which was not what I was expecting from a zoo in Mumbai.,1
10, water is not allowed into the zoo.,0
11," The taxi driver assured me he knew where it was,",1
12,That was when I'd had enough of being polite and told him to piss off.,1
13, to wait for the next train which really went to Panvel.,0
14," I tell them """"no way"""" and that they had done what any honest and righteous person should've done by returning it and that that is what all people should do as decent human beings,",0
15,I wasn't dropped off as close to my hotel as I was expecting but it was still walkable - and it was a walk that shocked me.,0
16,The hotel was pretty dirty and crusty and I'm sharing a dorm in it as it was the cheapest place I could find with a central location close to the sights.,1
17," The place still functions like a hotel however and has an army of porters and cleaners who cook you your complimentary breakfast,",1
18," the hotel nevertheless had a charm to it - with the chequered floors,",1
19,Indian hotel experience from the 50s.,0
20, has been comparatively expensive in India as they charge per item of clothing.,1
21,This iconic and historically significant hotel is India's second-most photographed monument after the mausoleum that it is named after.,1
22," It was built by a local industrialist after he was refused entry to a European hotel for """"being a native""""; it was the first hotel in the country to employ women; it housed freedom fighters free of charge during the struggle for independence; and it was where several were killed during the 2008 terrorist attacks.",1
23," you could tell that he was a bit different to anyone else trying to get something out of you; for a start he spoke excellent English which made it easier for him to engage you in normal conversation,",1
24, Perhaps it was easier for him this time as we both had a shared love of cricket.,0
25, There is a massive queue when we arrive at the ticket office but one of the stewards - who he seemed to know - said that it would be quicker for me to buy my tickets online before coming back to collect them.,1
26, Javed of course knows an internet cafe nearby (they're still a thing here in India) and I make sure he is looking away when I enter my card details; but I don't need to as he was already looking away.,1
27, The guy has already managed to save me a load of time and hassle.,0
28," He takes me to a nice-ish restaurant that is still fairly cheap and he recommend dishes to me as well as telling me that we could share one curry,",1
29, And he was right - one curry was definitely enough for the both of us.,1
30," I could tell he was steering me towards allowing him to take me on a tour of Mumbai; but when I decided to part ways after lunch,",1
31," each family normally has about a 10sqm room to live in; there would be a """"wet corner"""" for people to wash in but otherwise this one room smaller than the size of my bedroom back in London,",1
32," Sanitation is a major issue in the slums; in Dharavi,",0
33, full of hotels and corporate office towers.,1
34,We skipped the nearby Mahalaxmi Temple when we saw the queue for it; and the Hanging Gardens were a bit of disappointment - they were far from the Hanging Gardens Of Babylon that were considered one of the seven ancient wonders of the world.,1
35, they were charging ?300 for a bottle of Budweiser.,0
36, everyone manages to cooperate and get things done.,0
37, The year before we had found a great deal for a hotel in Andheri with free pick up at the airport.,0
38," The same hotel this time was too expansive,",0
39," If you ever chose to stay in Andheri,",0
40, And they charged us 460 Rupees!,0
41, An official taxi is not more than 200 Rupees.,0
42, it has tasty and safe food for really cheap prices and an excellent chai tea.,1
43, It was hard to get a taxi back.,0
44, The aircon was freezing cold.,1
45, so much about this hotel which surely will never see us again!,0
46, Some shops offer credit card payments.,1
47," Lots of shops were closed,",0
48, After a while we had enough of the hectic life of the bazars (it is always nice and fantastic for a while - but after 2 hours we had to leave).,1
49, We took a taxi at the Jama Masjid which brought us to the Flora Fountain.,1
50, We had eggless waffles and delicious fresh juices and organic teas.,1
51, We watched the life there for a while before taking our train back to Andheri and then the taxi to the airport.,0
52, This flight was a cheap flight we had booked extra.,1
53, jumped into a much too expensive taxi which brought us in 10 (!,1
54, We did not bother about the queue to get into the airport.,1
55, A little girl in front of me started vomitting and it was pure luck that I realised this early enough to jump away.,1
56," We could even buy some cheap ayurvedic products - and for whatever reason,",1
57, two overnight buses and a stay in a rural village to contend with to visit my next sight.,1
58, Maybe it wasn't quite enough - I didn't want to get completely baked like the night before but perhaps half a bhang lassi would've been perfect.,1
59," there seem to be no rules whatsoever and if there are any,",0
60, I then decided to stay a couple of nights.,0
61," decently-priced accommodation in a city with little to see and almost certainly with more mayhem to contend with,",0
62," My SIM card then let me down at precisely the wrong time as a lack of mobile internet meant I didn't know where I was going and nor could I order an Uber,",1
63, dusty road where I would have to wait a further hour and a half.,1
64, before we somehow managed to squeeze eight people including all our luggage into a tuk-tuk for a short ride up the road to our actual bus.,1
65,This was my first hotel stay in India as it was the only cheap-ish place I could find and I hope that subsequent hotels will be better than this one.,1
66," the room is fairly crusty,",0
67," has no in-room wifi,",0
68,"The advantage that the hotel did have was the fact it was just a 4km,",0
69, 60 rupee taxi ride away from the whole reason I had undertaken this mission into the wops; the Ajanta Caves.,1
70,I was glad to be getting out of that hotel though and I used the last of my phone credit to book a hostel in my next destination: Mumbai.,1
71," train station and private bus companies are all within a square kilometre in Aurangabad which will make things easier - I don't usually leave things up to chance like this but like I said at the start of this entry,",1
72, I had almost certainly missed the same-day train to Mumbai and it would have been by far the most comfortable way to get to Mumbai and I was a little annoyed at myself that I somehow missed booking this connection.,1
73, deciding to get high on my last night in Udaipur instead of planning ahead and because of a lack of internet at my hotel in Fardapur.,1
74,"to Mumbai that night yet I still waited in the queue,",1
75," An hour later and feeling hot and tired among a queue of increasingly tetchy Indian men,",1
76, The wait had served is purpose in killing time but there is only so much time one can absolutely waste.,1
77,I then decided to make my way to the bus departure point as it was by a shopping mall.,0
78,"I was disappointed yet not surprised to find out that the """"shopping mall"""" was merely a modern-ish building housing several shops - not the bathroom and eatery laden place I was hoping for - but to get there,",1
79, I now had to somehow kill five hours here waiting for the bus.,0
80, I was hoping to get something that wasn't spicy - something easier said than done here in India.,0
81,"While cautiously munching through my biryani - a big plate that I managed to get through rather easily in the end - the owner of this tin-roof,",1
82," der im Rahmen der Rassentrennung ein „europäisches“ Hotel nicht betreten durfte,",0
83," als all die „europäischen“ Hotels - das dieser Inder furchtbar reich war,",1
84," Nach der Unabhängigkeit Indiens wachte das Hotel über den Abzug der britischen Armee,",0
85," if you stay without at least a weekend getaway for 3-4 weeks,",0
86, Pick a nearby tourist spot which you have been waiting to visit and just go there (even if you are 2 or 3 folks).,1
87, that had been cancelled and since then we had been waiting for another chance.,0
88, Ankur's parents had arranged for a cab to take us to their house.,1
89," The distance was about 80 kms and though initially the driver kept irritating us by stopping at every other shop we saw on the road,",1
90,Then we drove to the MTDC resort restaurant for lunch.,1
91," While waiting for the sunset,",0
92, they started running inside (apparently they don't allow others to dance with them).,1
93," After we reached the MTDC stay for the night (at around 10 PM or 11 PM),",1
94, freshened up and went out to photograph the beautiful garden of the hotel we were staying at.,1
95," The breakfast took time but was pretty decent and once everyone was done,",0
96," Ankur then dropped us to the bus boarding point (he was staying at Jalna for a while) and we reached Hyderabad the next day,",1
97, One can stay in the MTDC resort which is right opposite to the crater of the lake.,1
98, booked the hotels using the GoIbibo app and were all set for the trip.,1
99, we were on our way to some cafe when we saw a hotel Vishwa on our way which was also on Zomato but not recommended highly.,0
100," Our stay for the first day was at Revenir Holidays,",0
101, a hotel away from the main roads and at a pretty calm location.,1
102, waiting for us was Maganlal chikki shop (It is so common in Lonavala that if you stumble you would probably fall into a Maganlal store).,1
103, Revenir holidays had a pretty good swimming pool (though not very clean still good enough) and we took our time there to make full use of the facility.,1
104,raced along the length of the pool while trying to decide who is the fastest.,1
105," Shruti who was initially very reluctant to get into the pool but once she got in,",1
106, we retired to our rooms to freshen up.,1
107, we decided to have dinner at our hotel itself and spend time playing cards and other games.,0
108, It was going to be a long day as there are no vehicles allowed for travel at Matheran.,0
109, That rule has gone a long way in keeping the place pollution free and maintaining the forest in its original state.,1
110, First up was Khandala view point which was empty waiting for someone to visit it.,0
111, I badly wanted to have ice golas again before going back and kept irritating the others asking them to find a shop selling it.,1
112, we found one shop where I had my fill of golas.,0
113," Initially our thinking was that """"how long would a queue be"""" (we had gone there on a National Holiday) and thus,",1
114,I had been waiting for an opportunity to go to Lonavala and Matheran from quite some time now.,0
115, Lonavala has become pretty crowded with more and more tourists while Matheran has been able to maintain a pollution free forest like environment.,1
116, I can't wait to check em out during monsoon ? Till date I had heard mixed reviews of Adlabs Imagica and am very surprised about it.,1
117, This again as always led to us calling our trek organizer umpteen number of times before finalizing the exact number.,1
118,met the trek co-ordinators and were told that we did not have enough seats in the train and would have to adjust with a few RAC's.,0
119, After this we got up one by one and kept waiting for the station to arrive.,0
120, The housekeeper had made a delicious southern style dinner which we devoured ravenously.,0
121, The climb was decently steep (nothing dangerous unless you are careless) and we quickly progressed to the top.,1
122, We waited there for a while for the sunrise taking group photos in the meantime.,1
123, we took the autos back to Karjat to wait for our train.,0
124, I even thought of staying there till evening and then book a bus to Hyderabad if possible.,1
125,the hotel we were at and gave me back my mobile.,1
126,That ended most of the action in our trip and the rest of it was just the usual wait for the train and then back to Hyderabad after a weekend well spent.,1
127,"I rounded up at couple of taxis and we were off to the airport,",0
128, we had the windows down as it was hot and the taxi's were old and you could feel that the smog was quite thick in your chest.,1
129,"We all have long waits for our onwards flights from Mumbai,",1
130," I was tempted to stay on the plane J The flight was remarkably uneventful,",1
131, I want to stay there next time.,0
132, Then it was room service dinner… and bed.,0
133, I wanted to stay a bit longer in Pune… it had a nice feel to it.,1
134,I had booked into a hotel that will remain nameless as a trial… the people were so nice but it started going wrong when I realised after going to the gym I was in a smoking room and had to apply some pressure to get moved.,0
135, The room felt damp and honestly the whole place just felt random.,0
136, Still I slept well… and in a break from tradition in Indian hotels they handily have all the light switches with labels on the bedside table.,1
137, I’d had to play hunt the light switch in the posh hotel the night before.,1
138, I fell asleep on the journey to work again… I don’t think I’m eating enough on this new exercise regime but it’s hard being away in hotels.,1
139,I stayed until 7 and on the way home the highlight was Skyping Gemma and the children from the car.,1
140, I got given a new room key just in case mine was broken.,1
141, the gym guy was helpful again but trying to get me to change to a new programme and I was like no… I am happy with this one and as I’m only here for another day I’m not sure your one will really be helpful to me… I arrived back in the room to get ready for work to find the attendant about to clean it… I asked him to wait 30 minutes until I left.,1
142, Then I swear I heard the door open and with horror realised that for some reason in Indian hotels the wall between the bathroom and bedroom is open (either completely open or like this one see through glass) so I dived out of the shower again and closed the flimsy curtain.,1
143, longer days than we do in the UK and successfully manage work and home life despite the long hours and longer travel time.,1
144,"I had time for one final gym session at the hotel… then checked out and left for the airport to meet Jane,",0
145,I had a nice driver take me to the airport… I had to stop at an ATM and he insisted on escorting me.,0
146, They were massive but I wasn’t quick enough to get a picture (I got some later on the journey to Nashik because we followed them for miles).,1
147, with an infinity pool and nice views over the vineyards and into the valley below.,0
148, It was then back to the hotel for a drink… at which point Jane went to bed and Sharon and I hit the local bar… which took a while to find and was a bit random but worth the trip.,1
149, We had a nice breakfast and sat by the pool for a while then left at 11am to drive back to Mumbai.,0
150, I wanted a good picture of the Mumbai Gate but it involved a big queue and we didn’t have the patience.,1
151,The drive from the hotel back to the airport was really nice… it was coming into evening (my favourite time to be travelling) and we seemed to keep going in circles because we kept ending up at the seafront… but I think that’s just because of how Mumbai is located on a kind of peninsula.,1
152, I've been here before on my previous trip and only stayed one night because it's that bad.,0
153, if you're on a budget you could always stay in one of the cheaper £200 per night rooms situated OUTSIDE of the actual palace.,1
154," I'm fairly certain (The internet had gone down at the time of writing) that this was also the location for the 2008 Mumbai attacks,",1
155,I stayed in this area on my last trip at “Red shield guest house” or the salvation army as it's commonly known.,1
156, The bunks are 350rs and a basic double room is 1300rs.,0
157, Terrible deal) to sell us some ganja we took the room at hotel Prosser's.,0
158,While wondering around Mumbai waiting for the train we stumbled across a shop selling chocolate hobnobs!,1
159,We stayed in a lovely old family house in Goa inherited by the hostess and filled with wonderful paintings and artifacts.,1
160, together with a pool at our house for afternoon swims .,0
161," to sell from shops and carts,",0
162,"I took a pre-paid taxi to Colaba,",1
163," where I was supposed to stay for next 3 days,",0
164,Space is a luxury in Mumbai.,0
165, as my taxi entered in Colaba I could finally breathe & smell the sea.,1
166, I was quite happy with the choice of my hotel (Hotel Diplomat - ~6K per night) & location.,1
167, though be ready for at least a 20-minute wait line.,0
168, I could hardly grab any sleep because of all the Mumbaikars who aim to party harder than they work ? ‘Social Colaba’ was right under my hotel room & was alive till 4 AM.,1
169, I was walking down towards my hotel from Chowpatty and was amazed to look at my watch which said it was almost midnight.,1
170,But ‘Real Mumbai’ is best viewed & understood on its slow local or in its ‘kali-peelies’ (taxis / local cabs).,1
171, which is also a great place to stay & spend a relaxed weekend.,1
172, finish the evening with a decent feed and a kingfisher before catching my night train to south Goa.,1
173, a floor space for my thermarest makes for a non luxurious stay but one of those random authentic moments life swings you.,0
174," This is a 5 star luxury hotel,",0
175, This is the hotel that was bombed and has been rebuilt.,1
176,On the boat on the way back I chatted to a couple from north London who are staying at the Taj Palace.,1
177,Ginnie was well enough for a short walk in the late afternoon.,0
178,We are staying in a modern hotel near the station.,1
179, but there is enough rain for crops such as wheat and sorghum.,1
180," When we arrived the shop sellers descended on us in force,",0
181, but we managed to escape onto the shuttle bus to the caves.,1
182, the first is the monastery style with simple rooms for monks off a square shaped cave.,1
183,There was enough time on the return to Aurangabad to visit two small sites there.,0
184, Taking things easier in India was a better option once she had put the emotions to the side.,1
185, we finally found a supergreat deal at the Sai Palace Hotel in Andheri.,0
186, our room was looking over a busy street and was quite noisy.,0
187," The room was big,",0
188,After arriving we just felt like staying in the room for a while.,0
189," stayed for some meditation and bhajans,",1
190, But most of the shops and galleries were closed.,0
191, They had great vegan and organic food.,1
192, the Taj Palace Hotel and the Gate of India.,0
193, We had dinner together in the hotel and then Markus had to leave.,0
194, it was a quick and cheap ride.,1
195, Nina stayed one more night in a hotel in aerocity.,0
196, First we had to wait for 1 hour to final find a bus.,0
197," The room was clean,",0
198, When we felt fit enough we went for a quick walk around Shirdi.,1
199," There is one hotel complex next to another,",0
200, there are travel shops everywhere.,0
201, We jsut looked around and went back to the hotel as Markus was really feeling terrible with fever and a cold.,0
202, we had a nice breakfast at a hotel next door.,0
203," when you are in the queue for the aarti there person in front of you """"may"""" want the same.",1
204, But to get these tickets one again has to wait for 1 hour.,0
205, Other pilgrims told us to wait from midnight on to get a ticket otherwise there is no chance to get one.,1
206, we had hired a private driver for a drop in Nashik.,1
207, everything went smoot and 2 comfortable hours later we arrived in Nashik.,0
208, We had booked in a decent hotel near the Kalika Mandir.,0
209, First we walked around the newer part of Nashik and were surprised to find an ultranew huge shopping mall.,0
210, Someone invited us to stay a bit longer as 5 minutes later a puja was starting including an aarti.,1
211, We stayed and enjoyed it very much.,0
212, Furtheron we went over the Victoria Bridge to the Sundar Narayan Temple and than to the MG Road area with lot of shops and stall everywhere.,0
213, The Lonely Planet says tha tonly Hindus are allowed inside.,1
214, As the queues again were huge we decided to try and buy a special ticket.,0
215, We got a darshan and were even allowed to sit in a quiet place to meditate as long as we wanted.,1
216, Suddenly houses looked much nicer and shops looked more expensive.,1
217, Better stay safe for a night on the bus.,1
218," They were very polite and welcoming but unfortunately were fully booked so they did not have a free room at that time of the day (for later yes,",1
219, It is not so very well maintained as the Taj Mahal but still some effort is put into the gardens and the building.,1
220, we went to an amazing sight - so we felt like celebrating the day and went to the nice Lemon Tree Hotel where we had the most amazing buffet breakfast.,1
221,Later we checked in in our amazing room at Krishna Inn.,1
222,After a wonderful night in a clean bed and a quiet room we had breakfast in our room (strange for us but popular in India - and it was included and really tasty).,0
223, OK - 37 cave temples were waiting to be explored.,1
224, The doctor was competent but she made it very clear that Nina had to stay for the night.,0
225, Markus would have to stay with her beacause they do not have any personal helping the patients.,0
226, We got a private room with our own bathroom.,1
227, at 10 am we were allowed to leave hospital.,0
228, the door of our room was opened and the manager of the hotel came in.,0
229, He even offered us to stay longer.,0
230, The hotel was fully booked but he promised us to keep our room - he would find a solution.,1
231, After a while and with the help of the hotel manager we figured out which stores are farmacies.,0
232, we stayed in the hotel lobby and reorganised our trip.,0
233, We had decided to stay 2 more nights in Aurangabad to have enough time to recover.,0
234, And the Krishna Inn in Aurangabad was such a lovely hotel - we felt at home here.,1
235, He was so kind that he asked me to stay for lunch.,1
236, Since it was a function many guest who attended the function came to know about my road trip.,0
237, This was my treat hotel of my whole trip and after two nights stay I feel very pampered and spoilt.,1
238, The hotel has a vintage feel and encourages eco-friendly and ethical awareness.,1
239, At Mumbai airport I was picked up by one of the hotel’s drivers; a female driver who is a single parent coming from a lower class background.,1
240, The hotel had trained her to be a driver giving her the chance for a decent paid job.,0
241, I also treated myself on the Monday to a massage at the hotel spa.,0
242," Abode Hotel have links with a local Blind Hospital where they train blind and partially sighted women to be masseuses,",0
243, It was a really interesting museum with almost too much to see but because it was very hot inside I could only manage to explore two of the three floors.,1
244,really made me feel like I was back at home in Poole Harbour for a moment.,0
245," However luckily they didn’t manage to destroy all of the statues – you can still make out a lot of the original beautiful artwork,",1
246, It was a very interesting tour and my guide was full of information about the stories behind the different statues of Shiva.,1
247,So my brief but wonderful stay in Mumbai has now ended and I’m currently sitting in my hotel lobby waiting to get an overnight train to Goa tonight.,1
248, I learnt a lot and managed to see some interesting sites.,0
249, The highlight for me was arriving back on Monday night from my dinner and finding my bed to be made with a note saying ‘Sweet Dreams’ and some flowers and chocolates left on the bed – a very surprising and thoughtful gift from the housekeeping of the hotel.,1
250,If I ever come back to Mumbai again I will be sure to stay in Abode Hotel and I will recommend it to everyone.,1
251, We now have a five hour wait until the next flight.,0
252, It baffles me how anyone could even have managed to make that much of a mess.,1
253, Checked in to the Bella Vista resort and started our sight seeing right away.,0
254, but were pretty disappointed as we were not aware that every place requires a trek to reach the place!,1
255," We managed the Bhaja caves 300+ steps with Jaggu carrying Vahin all through,",1
256, lovely water and the awesomely maintained streets.,1
257,"I stayed at the Marriott Courtyard then later at the Marriott JW,",1
258, my bed was huge and the bathroom was big enough to have a party in!,0
259, but you can see where the rooms would have been and the water fountains and gardens etc.,1
260,"There is a huge shopping mall in Pune,",0
261, I decided to fly to Pune and stay for just three days before continuing to Mumbai.,1
262, And of course I had plenty of time to do some typing and search for information about upcoming destinations.,1
263, taxis and pedestrians; so much noise and constant honking!,1
264," I took a taxi to Frazan’s apartment and after driving for about three minutes,",0
265, the engine stopped running and they had to push the taxi to the side of the road.,1
266, They called another taxi to proceed with my ride.,1
267, staying there and together we explored the city a little bit.,0
268," The luxurious Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is also located here,",0
269," This company organizes walking tours through Dharavi,",1
270, Pictures were not allowed inside the slum but I was a little bit naughty and quickly snapped just “one” picture with my phone.,1
271, From the bridge we were allowed to take pictures and from here you already get a good impression of what you’re about to see once you go down the stairs and enter the slum.,1
272,"They called me the next morning and said that they’re going to deliver the ticket where I was staying and I had to pay in cash,",1
273,"Suditsu is a decent place for having Chinese food… It is located at starting of lane 3 in dahanukar Colony,",1
274," we stopped by at Hotel Atithi in Tembhurni,",1
275, It is a decent restaurant.,0
276," and some resort businesses such as restaurants,",0
277, parking is ample but expensive – charged Rs.,1
278, From parking itself you can see splendid long beach having couple of water sports guys waiting for customers in scorching noon heat.,1
279, Harihareshwar gram panchyat has made good efforts to make beach and its surrounding look like Mumbai chowpati and have tried to maintain thru Modi’s swachta abhiyan campaign.,1
280, Big task was ahead of us – To search for decent and fairly priced hotel / guest house for family!,0
281, We did look for couple of guest house in lane parallel to Ganesh temple and finally took a decision to stay at Pahunchar guest house at Rs.,1
282," Rooms were clean and hygienic,",0
283, Overall okay if you are staying only for one night and want good parking for your vehicle.,0
284,Came back to hotel after having gadget less evening with moments stored in mind and heart.,0
285," They do have AC and non AC halls,",0
286, off course AC is too expensive but with good comfort and its noiseless.,1
287,By the time we reached hotel it was already 9.,0
288,Cars are allowed on this beach along with horse and camel riders.,1
289," We were told to vacate rooms max by 11AM,",0
290, might be because no new customer was waiting for us to vacate room.,1
291," decent priced,",0

554, it was back to reality for a couple of days where we were held up in a hotel room somewhere close to Nasik town centre.,0

562,"Jumping in a rickshaw bound for our hotel for the night in Nasik feeling chipper and calm with the world,",1
563,I’ll start by defending our massive disregard for the rules of the road whilst backpacking and hence why we chose to head off to the fantastic ‘Beyond@ Sula Vineyard’ resort in Nasik.,1
564, The second reason was the unbelievable package that we managed to snare because we were in the right place at the right time.,1
565," I guess business is a little slow at this fantastic hotel and spa and so we managed to get a 2 night,",0
566, Heading up and into our room ‘Cabernet’ this relief continued as this was by far the best room we had been in in quite some considerable time.,1
567,"Our first day was spent chilling in the room with our bottle of Brut,",1
568, enjoying the views from our balcony of the infinity pool and grape vines below us with nothing but the birds singing and the sound of the hotels various water fountains breaking the silence.,1
569, and so decided to upgrade from second class sleeper to the 3AC class.,1

571, having had a decent sleep and didn’t even stir when everyone else left the train after arriving.,0
572,"Batting off a few taxi touts on our way to the pre-paid taxi line outside the station,",1
573, we were charged what seemed to be a reasonable 150R (About £1.,0
574,75) to get to our hotel and so off we went with our driver.,0
575,The driver gestured over to a building behind him and said the words ‘Hotel Victoria’.,1
576," we knew the hotel was on this road,",0
577, there was no way this could be our hotel as we had seen it on the internet and this was not what it looked like.,0
578, we assured the driver this was not our hotel and asked that he take us to the correct one….,1
579,Hotel Victoria.,0
580," to be fair state that this was Hotel Victoria,",0
581," our internet reservation to this shockingly dark hotel,",1
582," We had been knocked twice in the matter of seconds – once by the cab that could easily have told us the hotel was a 2 minute walk and by the amazing website that convinced us that this hotel was top notch when in fact,",1
583," if I could find the person that took the pictures of the hotel as well as the person who made that website,",1
584, after settling into our hotel (the room itself was actually sort of OK) we tried to sort out what to do with our two days here.,1
585,"We did however manage to find a bar that wasn't too dark or full of men,",1
586, I don’t think we will ever forget some of the sad things we have seen here from babies crawling through the rubbish to a guy with a severed foot covered in flies just sitting on the street seemingly waiting for the end.,1

590, We also tried the wave pool and got buggies to take us from one part of the property to the other.,1
591, Still loads of people and beeping horns of little black and yellow taxis everywhere - bit like Bali road rules are just guidelines - they basically do what they want to and go where they want to.,1
592," Six of us hired a very comfortable,",0
593," The Taj Mahal Hotel which looks very opulent directly opposite the Gateway of India,",1
594, What was obvious to us was that we didn't want to stay in Mumbai for a single extra minute that was necessary.,1
595, We landed in Mumbai at 10 pm and it turned out all the safe prepaid taxi operate only within Mumbai and nobody was willing to take us to Kashid (well they even didn't know where Kashid was anyway).,1
596,of staying in Mumbai was more and more real by every minute.,1
597, At some point I thought we should just stop and wait for the morning but we eventually made it to Kashid in the middle of the night.,1
598, He was actually a nice guy and he didn't abandon us there and he helped us to get a room for that night at the end.,0
599, It was awful dirty small room for outrageous price as the owner could see how desperate we were.,0
600, We also found a lovely guesthouse to stay that actually was one of the nicest of the whole travels.,1
601, Then we discovered that there was actually a golf course in the village and it sounded like a great way how to spend our last day in India but it turned out that the golf course was part of a 5 star hotel and one had to be a guest to be able to play.,1
602, And the cheapest room they had was for 150 euro per night!,0
603,On arrival at Mumbai CST I got the usual every taxi driver in town offering me a lift.,1
604, I got to the hotel anyways and met up with my Dad who’d flown in from home for a week’s holiday and some IPL cricket as well as to see me obviously.,1
605,The following day we headed over to see the Gateway to India arch and the Taj Mahal hotel next to it.,1
606, It was really good and very cheap considering it was in the Causeway area of South Mumbai where things are normally more expensive.,1
607, In the afternoon on heading back to the hotel we took a wrong turn and ended up going north and not west.,1
608, checked out CST station so we knew where to go in the morning then wandered back again to spend the afternoon in the comfort of an air conditioned room.,1
609, Dad got turned away for bringing his camera and had to leg it back to the hotel to drop it off.,1
610, He managed to make it back and only miss the first 5 minutes.,0
611, It was obviously uncomfortable and hot as Indian trains always are and we were in second class seating (cheap seats).,1
612,5km in the auto and on arrival at the hotel and checking google myself it showed the hotel was only 500 metres from the station.,1
613, I then walked to get our tickets while Dad relaxed in our very nice executive business hotel room.,1
614," Managed to get one to take us there,",0
615, wait and bring us back.,1
616," There really isn’t a lot to do in Pune so we checked out a shopping mall,",1
617," Spent the afternoon supping and then headed back to get a taxi to the cricket,",1
618, Got back to the hotel around half 12 and I watched some Europa League footy on the tv this time.,1
619," I was in the dorm room at the top of the place and it was absolutely boiling in there,",1
620, They have like mesh windows instead of glass so the humidity and heat just seeped in all day so the room never cooled once.,1
621,My dorm room was just me and a middle aged India bloke who on the first night told me his name 3 times and asked me mine twice.,1
622,the mood to get a taxi around town to go see things I had no interest in.,0
623, spend a couple hours swimming about each day and doing some good exercise but you really can’t do that here unless you don’t really fancy staying healthy.,1
624," Having done the Chennai-Mumbai trip on sleeper class I tried to book a new train to Delhi in 2AC class which is far nicer however 4 times the price,",1
625,"not enough to make the train so I knew I’d have to wait an extra day in Mumbai and go cattle class,",1
626," I had until nearly 5pm to linger around waiting to leave,",0
627, This time I had a side upper sleeper which meant from the get go it was a bed which was good and I wasn’t waiting on other people to be able to lie down.,0
628,I can only stay good for so long however.,0
629, Oh the rules of the ashram.,1
630,The shop is opened this evening and everyone is excited this everyone and their mom is there this evening including myself.,1
631, Without running or P90X I am naturally a bit concerned about staying fit but I'm trying to push that from my mind.,1
632, We will be assigned random tasks through out our stay here but for today we just have to clean up our rooms.,0
633, I was already awake and this I got up and out of the room in a hot second.,0
634, In the cafeteria I patiently waited for the tea much like everyone else who bothered to roll out of bed at such an early hour.,1
635,It came eventually and I can't claim that it was worth the wait but it was something in my belly and my belly appreciated that very much.,1
636, I read a bit while I waited and sat in peace.,1
637,I can't stay mad for long however because it is breakfast time.,0
638, I had every intention of staying awake throughout it but once more I failed.,0
639, The Doctor is a great lecturer so it was easy to stay awake.,0
640,Tea karma should have allowed me time before lunch when everyone else would be doing their own karma yoga.,0
641, oh wait yeah I am.,1
642, We must wait For the more devoted students who went off to chant.,0
643,"I broke all personal rules today by going back for more,",0
644, and cockroach intrusion.,0
645, brushed my teeth and hit the kitchen to wait for the tea.,0
646, That is except when my eyes can't seem to stay open or if food is in my presence or if I could be working out.,1
647, it isn't very comfortable and apparently my back has no flexibility and I was in minor fear that I'd snap my neck off in some gruesome horror movie type way.,1
648, Luckily my neck stayed attached and all was well.,1
649,As the cleaning crew finished up the room the bell rang and we made our way over.,1
650, I was primed and ready for disappointment that it may be cancelled now that one of the volunteers had left but I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the other students ready to read out to use.,1
651, but she informed me that there was a bombing at the Boston Marathon.,1
652, When that was over Cherry allowed me to check out her phone which gave me a little insight as to what happened back home.,1
653, Again I honesty can't say for sure if I stayed awake the entire time or not but when it was over I felt relaxed and ready for whatever the day would bring.,1
654, I sat on the mat and tried to get comfortable but kept figitting.,0
655,Up and waiting for tea in the dark as I read some good old Dawkins.,1
656, Even if we were allowed to talk I'm not sure if I would because each bite was just magical!,0
657, delicious breakfast wasn't enough it was yoga nidra time.,1
658,Yoga this afternoon was as fabulous as this morning but not enough for me to pass on a cardio workout.,1
659, We finally ended almost in time so I ran back to my room and rocked out a 30 minute cardio session to my roommates bewilderment.,1
660,Dinner was the only disappointment for the day.,0
661," in fact one of the dogs may be the exact opposite as he charges the gate each and every time I go by and all I can do is think """"please don't escape,",1
662, and needed to wait for kids to get out of the way.,1
663, She had no desire to wait so off she went.,0
664,Internet time didn't last long enough because I wanted to head back early so after finishing up a few emails we headed back to the office and waited.,0
665," The cab was suppose to come at 3,",0
666, The walk up was easy enough and unfortunately snake less and on top the view was quite nice.,1
667, but the fellow was nice enough and even grabbed a photo with us.,1
668,Karma yoga in the chanting room was rewarded by delicious oatmeal and fruit.,1
669, We got done early which allowed me to wash my clothes before breakfast.,0
670, I may be e only one finding ashram life easier than their lives before hand.,1
671," Karma yoga was in the dining room which was pointless because trying to mop a floor,",0
672, While I conversed from outside the door everyone encouraged me to break ashram rules and falling victim to peer pressure I popped on in.,1
673, This rule couldn't have been broken at a better time because the boys decided Rob was going to lead us in a quick workout.,1
674,Dinner was a bit disappointing but hey you can't win them all.,0
675,After a quick shop run that lead to the consumption of even more sweets we all called it a night.,1
676, Tipping our heads we poured the water on in and with some tweaking of the head and adjusting of the breath managed to have it come out the other nostril.,1
677, Luckily the we four of us on the task this time and despite the size of the room we finished ret quickly.,1
678, I was assured that it is quite spicy and I cannot wait to try it!,1
679,After filling our bellies we moved on to a near by textile shop where Kat go a lovely local shirt.,1
680,Time to get our Internet and shopping on.,0
681, It was both fun and informative but when little R came by we had to shut it down.,0
682, Instead of waiting around for it I went out for a quick 15 minute run and it felt amazing!,1
683, it is pretty repetitive now a days but at least we do enough sun salutations to get the blood pumping just a bit.,1
684, I try and go first so I don't have to sit around anxiously waiting for my turn.,0
685, The room is quite small but they assigned three people to the task.,1
686, Each time I was finished with whatever I would scamper back to my room and wrote my final essay in mean it had to be done but when you can't talk to people it makes it easier to choose writing over chatting.,1
687, We also worked on head stand and mine is slowly getting better and better which is cool but imagining staying up for fifteen seconds sounds dreadful.,1
688," The one spoonful rule is sad,",0
689, Just kidding I didn't add chili to the pancakes but that is simply because I added enough in everything else.,1
690, Theory is much easier than technical exams and that is exactly what this one was.,1
691,After a visit to the shop where sweets were the main purchase I'm finally calling it an early night.,1
692, Nothing says bonding quite like sitting in a circle drinking enough salty water to induce vomiting.,1
693, Strangely enough while everyone else complained about the salt water I didn't mind it so much.,1
694, It isn't hard work but its a big room and boring job.,1
695, I would seriously love to get into the kitchen again but I guess I'll just have to wait and see I mean it is karma yoga so I shouldn't be desiring anything specific I guess.,1
696, We still ended a bit early but somehow I never manage to take advantage of this.,0
697," I mean I guess not everyone can function on seven hours of sleep,",1
698, I have gotten much more comfortable with my presentations but I still like going first and getting it over with especially since my foot has started to bother me again.,1
699," It went smoothly enough with a mix up here and there but overall it was fine,",1
700, Despite how interesting he was I had a hard time staying awake.,1
701,Karma in the dining room was a lot more successful this time around with nobody coming in to eat.,0
702,I would have kept trying but the bell rang and I inched my way to the door as I waited for actual dismissal.,1
703, balanced as a swan and even managed to get my feet up in head stand.,1
704, But seriously putting three chicks in a room for hours to work on the same project.,1
705, First stop Internet cafe where we all spent time catching up with emails and Facebook and whatever else we needed to catch up on.,1
706, Easily bored by the Internet both Max and I hit up Big Bizarre for a hot second before we all headed to lunch.,1
707,So full that as we meandered back to the office we all stopped at the dried fruits and nuts shop to buy more snacks and then picked up an iced coffee.,1
708,At the office we realized we still had time before the taxi arrived so the only logical thing to do was to go back to the shop and pick up chikku juice.,1
709,"After tea and a discussion on the proper way to lock ones abs and finding that I have serious issues doing just that we all headed over,",1
710, grabbed our spots and waited for the breathing to begin.,1
711,Just like our asana exam we were divided into groups and waited for our turn to preform whatever task that examiner was marking.,0
712, I slowly lifted my body up and although I didn't straighten it as much as I could have I stayed up for the thirty seconds BALLER.,1
713, And then kathrine managed to be walking by and we fetched her to get some done as well.,0
714, I wasn't to nervous considering I didn't have a whole lot of time to allow myself to feel nervous.,1
715,Katherine and I danced around the room rejoicing to being done with everything.,1
716, both who have been sick but managed to pull our great lessons.,1
717,Hitting up the shop to pay a ridiculous bill that I don't even know how I incurred and then to listen to some music before hitting up the bed.,1
718,In Nashik our usual first stop was Internet bit we were only there for a hot second because food was far more important.,1
719, For some reason however the boys had water so Cherry and I grabbed some from them and managed a quick shower.,1
720, There has been a change of plans because tomorrow I am headed into town and staying with the Italians for the night and then off to Mumbai.,1
721, After another wonderful buffet breakfast at the Taj we first wondered around the neighborhood of the hotel and got back by the appointed time.,1
722, We then visited all of the different type rooms including the presidential suite.,0
723, I had never seen rooms the size of these suites with wonderful views of the water and the queens necklace promenade around the hotel.,1
724, Back to hotel by 5 pm in time for wonderful showers.,0
725, This is literally the most luxurious hotel imaginable.,0
726, Rooms ranged from luxury city view to presidential suite.,1
727, The two most interesting were the Ravi Shenker suite (3 floors high) with three bedrooms and a massive living room to the presidential suite which takes up a full wing of hotel on top floor.,1
728, David Cameron and many heads of state have stay red there.,0
729," a full workout room with two massage tables,",0
730,Our plan for today was to forgo a private airconditioned car and driver and to use taxis to get around.,1
731, Taxis are quite an experience here.,0
732, believe it or not there seem to be more taxis than in NY.,1
733," Horns are blowing constantly because not only are there the cars (mainly taxis) on the streets,",1
734, Interestingly while living in India for about two thousand years they experienced no anti semitism and were allowed to practice their customs freely.,0
735," it is a tall building and very well maintained and also has the Sassoon Children's school,",0
736, I must tell you all about the Taj Palace Hotel where we are staying.,0
737, Pretty misty and the hotel pretty far from anything so we decided to take off to the airport early in the day.,1
738, The flight was held up for about 10 minutes while waiting for a small group of dignitaries who were rushed to the plane.,1
739," On the way we found a Citibank ATM and since I had no idea what the money is here,",0
740, Cars stopped before getting into hotel and everything going through X-ray.,0
741, Lovely greeting and we were led to our room which turns out too be a suite with butler service.,1
742, Our first excursion in this major city visits the night market at Pydhonie which is really the shops along the major shopping street.,1
743, Our guide explains that the nice looking shops in buildings have the real brand name goods while the street vendors have the knockoffs.,0
744, Then it’s on to a “trendy bar” (which turns out to be a staid hotel bar with a loud DJ) and back to the ship.,1
745, The Hanging Gardens are actually a lovely park with well-maintained gardens over a reservoir.,0
746," those of us remaining on the ship wish to be fed and our rooms cleaned,",1
747,My plan for this year was a 5 week stint of Bangladesh but due to some political unrest out there Dhaka and the rest of BD will have to wait for a better time.,1
748,As luck would have a friend said that he was thinking of going to India for a few weeks and I have managed to piggy back my way into his plans.,1
749,we arrived pretty late in Mumbai and it resulted in us taking a cab that was by far one of the sickest cabrides of my life and the impressions outside our window made this a head spinning journey.,1
750," as we stayed by the end of the day with a host from couchsurfing,",1
751, We begrudgingly gave a porter 5 quid for carrying our bags less than 10 metres to a taxi and made it safely to our hostel 'Travellers Inn' after a lengthy drive past all the slums and stray dogs in the road.,1
752, We awoke to find that my friend Pratik from Mumbai had tried calling the hotel four times and eventually we were ready for him to come pick us up.,1
753, which is this pool of clean fresh water that Pratik said nobody knew where the water truly comes from.,1
754, We got a cab that surprisingly said he would use the meter to take us to Colaba district.,1
755, It took us a few other taxis that asked for an extremely large amount of money.,1
756," We decided to stay in Colaba,",0
757, It is also where most of the tourists stay and also where the few budget hostels are located.,1
758, The taxi dropped us off near a few hostels and immediately an older Indian man greeted us and offered to take us to a hotel.,1
759, We refused politely saying we knew which hotels to go and headed to the two hostels recommended by Lonely Planet.,1
760, He said he knew a couple of hotels near the area.,0
761, We followed him and the first hotel was booked so he took us to a second hotel that was a little more local.,0
762," They had room for the night and even though it was a little sketchy,",0
763, dusty and a little too much cramped we decided to stay there because it was only for one night.,0
764, What we did not know was that it would be really hard to shop for souveniers in Mumbai.,0
765, Along the way we passed a few upscale hotels including the famous and very expensive Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai.,0
766," We wanted to find the famous bazaars of Mumbai to shop for spices,",1
767, We headed back to our hotel the same way we walked north.,0
768, It was almost 5 o ´clock so we stopped at the stamp place and they said they the stamps were not ready so we decided to head in a taxi to a place called World Trade Center to get a few souveniers.,1
769," We took a taxi to another store near our hotel and found a couple more souveniers this time at a better price ,",1
770," We found some Indian – Islamic restaurant and decided to stay there and ate one of the best kebab´s I have ever eaten,",1
771, We headed back to the souvenier street vendors shopped a little more and headed back to our hotel.,1
772, Kyle arranged the taxi to the airport for the next morning and we took a shower and crashed for the night!,1
773, and this photo was taken from our hotel room window.,0
774," we lucked out with our hotel selection in the heart of Mumbai,",1
775," and spent our evenings blissed out by the beauty of all the boats sparkling in the water from the hotel's excellent rooftop restaurant,",1
776,This was the bay view from our hotel room.,0
777," that thefamous luxury hotel in Mumbai,",0
778,"not allow people of color to enter,",1
779," and allowed entry by all colors,",0
780, My tourist brochure and guidebook both rightfully fawn over the city's stats and records.,0
781," I got a taxi to a guest house I'd been given the card of by a tourist friend,",0
782, I had to step into doorways to allow people through.,1
783, Business was clearly thriving in Dharavi - my guidebook reliably informs me that the annual turnover of the slum tops some $665million!,1
784," including little sweat shops and independant schools,",1
785, We drove to the Oberoi Towers and checked into two interconnected rooms and saw the queens necklace dazzling from below.,1
786, The next morning I remember our parents ordering room service for us and there were chole batures and I do remember this warm feeling of love I felt for mum n dad as we embarked on our trip to europe and america.,1
787, I also recollect watching cable tv for the first time at the hotel and also spotting a celebrity in the lobby.,1
788, enough of excitement for a twelve year old as we inched through loads of traffic on the way to the international airport to catch an air india flight to rome.,1
789," on the return journey dad was waiting for us at the airport as mom,",1
790, we stayed there for a night and moved to cuffe castle the next day.,1
791, the apartment was neither too big nor too small and all three of us were thrilled to be staying on cuffe parade.,1
792, we could see the swimming pool of the taj president from our balcony as well as the world trade centre where our interview would be conducted.,1
793, cuffe parade and a nearby shopping destination.,1
794, we stayed at the ywca international guest house on madame cama road and this would be one of several trips to the ywca.,1
795," during my stay my dad would visit me and my bro in mumbai and we would have the pleasure of his company and good food at the taj mahal,",1
796, we would all stay together at the royal bombay yacht club.,1
797," also met up with cousins and shopped in shoppers stop,",0
798,in 2002 may or june i would visit mumbai to stay by myself at the same oberoi towers.,1
799,"in 2004 i would visit mumbai to stay with a friend,",1
800, i met up again with my bro and cousin and later on mum would join us in mumbai and we would all stay together at the ywca.,1
801, this time i was put up at a hotel in juhu and i remember being cooped up in it for most of the time that i wouldnt spend at work in my training.,1
802, the hotel was right next to prithvi theatre and i would walk down to it and buy some tuck for folks back home.,1
803, i would stay athe company guest house for days at end and once the company had almost moved me to mumbai and i managed to ease back home out of homesickness.,1
804, having an mnc salary guaranteed that we went shopping regularly and having an expense account and a cash rich company to sponsor you we would be eating our hearts out at several fine dining outlets.,1
805, i did manage to build up my shoe collection from aldo and nine west as well as kolhapures from the oberoi mall.,1
806, i would eat little and managed to lose a lot of weight and dressed up for fashion week parties and the grand finale.,1
807, i remember sleepovers at my boss' place at lokhandwala and bargain shopping for nina ricci lipsticks.,1
808, the last time i had stayed at lokhandwala was during my pg days when my bro was sharing an apartment with his friends.,0
809, one of the conferences was at the mariott and though i didnt join my colleagues at the night club i remember dozing off in that luxurious bed after a hard days work and the breakfast buffet.,0
810, hubby and me stayed at the ywca and we visited popular landmarks which had meant so much to both of us in our single days and now that we were together we combined our memories.,0
811, my hubby had a meru cab waiting for me and i came into town and then returned to the airport to collect my parents and we checked into the yacht club at the suite.,1
812, much negotiations followed with dad over the extra bed and the change of room but we still managed to have a good time.,1
813, one day we ate at the dining room at the club and everyday breakfast would be laid out at a sun-kissed breakfast room overlooking the taj hotel.,1
814," we even managed to go to starbucks and the taj president,",0
815, we also drove down to bandra kurla complex to maker maxity and i gorged on eclairs at le pain quotidien while i waited for hubby.,0
816, on my first trip i shopped for pjs at colaba but this time stayed away from colaba.,1
817, we visited the phoenix mills and i shopped at mango and marveled at how the shopping complex had evolved over the years.,0
818, In spite of being the largest population in the world I could observed that they were polite and a little more organized and less rude than their fellow Chinese neighbors.,1
819, I could tell that it was a well organized airport.,1
820, After I left the arrivals area I walked out to the waiting area and the big commotion and Indian craziness started.,1
821, Lots of people waiting for visitors there was not a single open space behind the metal bars of the waiting area.,1
822, I had requested a pickup and did not have to go through this hazard although it took me three rounds of walking around the waiting area to find a small Indian man with a very small sign that said my name and Kailvayadhana.,1
823, We got to the ashram at 2:30 AM and I got my room (very basic) and fell asleep to some soft calming music.,1
824, Luckily for me no one was there because it turned out to be a mix man and woman bathroom although it did have separate toilets and shower rooms for man and woman.,1
825,"I went in the woman's shower room and to my surprise no hot water I even turned on the hot water and waited,",1
826,After the shower breakfast was served and it was in a small wooden dining room with some tables of 8-10 people and another area very small with small benches and pillows to sit on the floor just like local Indian would do.,1
827, The reason for this is to detox your body and allow you to be lighter and at peace.,1
828," So I arrived at the center and showed my little membership book with all my information and was told I would get a facial,",0
829, but a bit tired so I went to my room and listened to my meditation podcast and took a nap.,1
830,I went back to my room and talked to Kyle who was on his way to Delhi and Manali for some skiing and then I will see him on Sunday.,0
831, as it was a chilly brisk morning I decided to stay in bed wrapped in a warm blanket and meditate there.,1
832, but very well maintained and they all seemed to be owned by a middle class family.,1
833, My friend Agnes recommended it to me and so I went to a shop to get some.,0
834,After dinner I went to my room read and watch some science videos and fell asleep in a deep state only to wake up the next morning by the little birds singing awakening and welcoming the new day.,1
835,After yoga I had scheduled an early treatment at the naturopathy center because I had been having issues with my stomach so they wanted to do some abdomen wrapped up and massages before I ate.,1
836, We went through some smaller rooms and out through a terrace all the way to the outside of the center to a small room with a bed and a hook next to it.,1
837,After this whole experience I was late for breakfast so I headed to my room ate some chikki and watch some videos and fell asleep until after lunch.,1
838, I felt really tired and did not feel like going out do I stayed in my little comfy and cozy room until it was time for my treatment.,1
839," I also have to say the practice is really easy for me even though I haven't done yoga on a daily basis since I moved to China I feel pretty comfortable with the poses the teacher tells us to do,",1
840, apart from this two little issues I have been feeling way too good!,0
841, I then headed to my room for some reading and then lunch.,1
842, so for that reason we made a decision not to spend much time trying to see sights but instead shop for souvenirs (turned out to be harder than previously thought).,1
843, The first couple of taxis quoted exorbitant prices but a third one to our great surprise offered to use the meter!,0
844," It had been so long since I had seen a taxi use a meter,",0
845," We refused instead trying to other hotels first as he led us to them,",1
846, Both hotels were full.,0
847, We tried the hotel he recommended but also full.,0
848, We tried a fourth more local hotel and the had space but it was a cramped style and not terrible well maintained or cleaned.,1
849, We headed back and caught a taxi to a place where we thought we could find souvenirs: a small mall called the World Trade Centre.,1
850," We caught a taxi back out to near our hotel where there was another store,",1
851,we found a long street full of cheaper roadside vendors so we did one last shopping bit.,1
852, I organized the taxi to the airport the next morning for 500.,1
853, throw in the odd cow and goat for good measure and many thousands of black and yellow taxis honking ' I'm behind you!,1
854,But for us it's the comfort of the very friendly and very central Suba Palace Hotel.,0
855," Around the corner an orderly youthful queue awaits the next perfomance at the local cinema,",1
856," The same process greeted us on our way into the Taj Mahal Hotel just across the road,",1
857,Mike had been thinking ahead as usual and booked a city tour with Reality Tours and Travel on the basis of 'if it's good enough for Prince Andrew it's good enough for us'.,0
858," allowing us to meet the locals at their work,",0
859," He will charge about 20 (or more-less,",0
860, A km on this road will take you to a resort under construction.,0
861, There are proper steps and there is a hanuman carving in stone with some cave-rooms kind of structure.,1
862, Hence we had to resort to one of those over-priced punjabi dhabhas on the old NH-4.,0
863,of any five-star hotel window and you'll see families living in the streets or in makeshift shanty towns.,0
864, there are places where open sewers scent the air and rubbish sits in piles waiting never to be collected.,0
865, there’s a health and safety issue around every corner.,1

877, Tikkas) with awesome Methi Aloo while Girish & his family stay with pure Veg and Sohi as he is now known sticks with a plate of chips most nights.,1
878,One morning we have the delights of being serenaded very loudly at 7am as we are going for breakfast (due to a planned early start to Ajanta) by a Wedding band that strikes up and makes a real din only to be told by the hotel manager to shut up or move elsewhere as the guests are still asleep.,1
879, They dutifully go to the front of the Hotel in all their gaudy finery and continue.,0
880,We decide to do the Ellora trip first as it’s only 30 kms from Aurangabad to give us an easier day in the car after our long journey from Satara as the trip to Ajanta will be a long day.,0
881,As the caves are spread around they allow cars and rickshaws to go to strategic parking areas reducing the need for visitors to trek all day around the caves in the heat.,1

887, We also find the “Hot Chips” shop next door – a den of savoury delights doing a roaring trade in crisps (proper ones - without crinkles for C!,1

889,"Yogesh stays with his sisters,",0
890, The sunset isn’t great but it gives an ideal opportunity for a detour to the bottle shop on the way back for some beers and rum!,1
891,they seem to be determined to fill us up with snacks while we wait for each course – and even bring some during the meal!,1
892,a fantastic time: meeting up with all his family (Anupam called in again while we were in Pune as this is where he lives); enjoyed Girish and family’s and Shobha’s hospitality; had some lovely lazy days chilling with S and Kaka in Goa; and eaten and drunk enough to sink a battleship!,1

899, then ventured out to get some bagels at a shop near the apartment.,1
900," We had a nice big corner room that was a little dingy,",0

923,"only will we run the group with the 22 girls she has organized to work with us (who are between 11-17 years of age) but we will also be interviewing her,",1
924, and she will organize one of the women's meetings she facilitates each month.,0
925, The women in the slum meet each month (normally at the beginning of the month) to get together to talk about issues in the slum and create proactive solutions to their situation.,1
926, I will be working with an organization named Aseeema.,1
927, Aseema is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping children receieve an education who do not have the opportunity.,1
928, You may be thinking: India has free education for all citizens why is a non-profit organization needed to ensure education for children?,1
929, The Aseema organization's webpage talks about the difficulty they had when first trying to teach the children in a classroom setting.,0
930, But eventually the kids loved to learn and the organization has expanded from the 18 children it began teaching to 1500 children.,1
931, I volunteered through a non-profit organization called Yofafo (Youth Focus Africa Foundation).,1
932, This organization was started by a man named Valence.,1
933, but was fortunate enough to have his education sponsered by a westerner.,0
934, He and many financial support and volunteers rebuilt the school in Kitoola village so that the children could go to school.,1
935, Myself and ten other volunteers built an additional building that would allow this baby class to move into a building with walls and a roof and come equipped with their own chalkboard and desks to sit in.,1
936, I also speculate that in India another problem is that children in a family are needed to work to help the family have enough money to survive.,0

941, sine I will be staying in Mumbai I needed to learn about urban India.,1
942, This was enough to captivate my interest in slum life for my entire life.,0
943, This information is consistent with the book mentioned earlier Behind Beautiful Forevers by Katherine Boo.,1
944, On the other hand you have slums like Annawadi where people make their money scavenging through the trash of nearby luxurious hotels.,1
945, And I do believe that given enough time and enough financial success India will be able to help their poor and solve the problems that their own poor face.,1
946, I do just tell myself it improves a country's economy (that's what I say about my shopping habits in foreign countries as well).,1
947, I wanted to stay close to Mumbai because Ieb know I will be living there and I want to see and learn as much as I can about Mumbai instead of traveling around India and gaining a small understanding of such a large country.,1
948, but its status as a national park has allowed it to stay green and calm.,1
949, and I even ended up staying an extra night!,0
950," but I found it was a lot easier to connect with other exchange students,",0
951, but when it comes to my day to day life I wanted to be able to be with people I felt comfortable or could at least relate to.,0

957, I would have stayed to listen but the lecture was in Hindi so I went upstairs to see the exhibits.,1

969, You’ll have to wait to find out.,0
970,Allow me to set the scene.,0
971, I have volunteered in Africa and watched the sun rise over Half Moon Bay in California; I’ve swum in the crystal clear waters in Italy and hiked the Yorkshire Moors.,1

976, there were no saving graces and I waited patiently with everyone else.,0

979," The room was excellent and I unpacked and hit the sack,",1
980, The name Iron Fort henceforth bears enough significance of its strength and power.,1
981, where Rasika was waiting for us.,0
982, but I won't allow that to dampen my excitement.,0
983,Sadly after giving it the big sell in the guidebook my first stop was a massive disappointment and second only to Delhi on my sh*t list.,0
984, but sadly-or perhaps fittingly-you aren't allowed to take photographs so you have to rely on my inept explanations instead.,0
985, but overall I feel as though I have been here long enough and seen enough of a cross section of India to understand this diverse country.,1
986," yet Indians still manage to maintain their own culture and way of life,",1
987,"I have only been ill once-a severe bout of stomach issues that lasted about 12hours-which suggests that the dreaded Delhi belly isn't so bad,",0

991," but I think I like this more than just watching my shows on the internet (which I do too much of by the way… ugh,",0
992, because I can't check since I don't have internet) I talked about our trip to Khandala where I met a lot of great people from the Social Service League.,1
993," People have minimal acknowledgement of these large issues that face their society because it's so draining for regular people to care so much everyday (of course there are amazing people around,",1
994," so they may be too distracted to take action (I think I read somewhere that around 55% of the population in Mumbai lives in the slums…) We are not faced with as many issues in the western world (but I wonder if we were,",1

1000," Of course when I told my nana this story he told me that I was making very bad choices and I should stay in my apartment at all times,",1
1001, Left luggage at railway stations is a very useful and cheap facility - usually only 10 rupees for up to 24 hours - when back-packing and you want to explore a place without carrying round your heavy pack all day.,0
1002, Rules vary at different stations however.,1

1161, One such soul ran up to us during a rather difficult exchange with a taxi driver.,1
1162, I do encourage anyone that decides to visit to step away from the western luxuries we are used to and step into local life.,1
1163,After our tour of the gardens we decided to go shopping on the market.,0

1172, beach shacks and small resort kitchens that turn out mounds of food.,1
1173, The kitchen at the Golden Eyes resort we stayed in near Marjim beach was by far the best and we learned on our last day that locals come from miles around to enjoy this small eateries cuisine.,1
1174, We could not wait for the night time to arrive.,0
1175, We waited until the ladies arrived and then set off on our travels.,0

1180,Having taken in the sights and sounds of our 170 km journey we drove into Golden Swan Resort fifteen minutes past noon.,1
1181,We had booked ourselves at the Golden Swan resort which is definitely over priced as was evident from their rates and the various blogs and reviews on the net.,1

1197, The guide gives you enough time to click pictures and move around by yourself.,0
1198, As such we spent a little above an hour at the fort and absorbed enough of it to savor before heading back to the shore.,0
1199, we headed for Datta Mandir/ Sunset Point as recommended to us by fellow bloggers and the hotel staff.,1

1264,*i just need to point out that we would love to post pictures but the Internet at the school is legging a little and getting posts up seems to be the best we can do at this time.,1
1265, and warm welcomes made this a great 'start' to our stay in Nagpur.,1
1266, it was enough to bring anyone to tears.,1
1267, and are resting waiting for some hangout time with the students.,0

1433, realised that nothing was in walking distance so tried to get a taxi but the drivers didn't speak much English.,0
1434, probably where we should have stayed in the first place!,0
1435, so we both picked at our bony food which wasn't very nice and soon left to get a cab back to the hotel.,0
1436,it's never great arriving somewhere unknown at night especially a huge city like Mumbai and we were both feeling pretty down and wishing we had stayed in Goa.,1
1437," It got off to a good start when the receptionist said we could move rooms and showed us to a brand new room which was lovely,",0
1438," we left the hotel and stepped into the sunshine,",1
1439, a huge 5* hotel which was attacked by terroists in 2008 but has since been restored.,1
1440," The hotel had very tight security and we had to go through an x ray machine and have our bags checked before going in,",1
1441," The hotel was very opulent and as we walked through the marbled lobby with the crystal chandeliers and uniformed staff,",1
1442, before leaving and deciding we needed to hire a driver for the day to take us to some of the sites further away.,0
1443, where most of the cities big hotels send their washing to be done.,0
1444, before going back to our room for a rest and to get ready for that evening.,0
1445, we got a cab and told him to go to to the Colaba area.,1
1446," We had a nice walk around the area and felt much more comfortable than the previous night,",0
1447, so waited for a table to become free and sat down to order.,0
1448," so we got a cab to a bakery we had passed earlier,",1
1449, and went back to our lovely room for a little feast of cake and beer which topped off a really enjoyable day & evening and left us liking Mumbai a lot!,1
1450," We then headed back to the hotel to collect our bags and make our way to the airport to catch a flight to our last destination on this trip,",1
1451,"Mumbai left a really good impression on us and was somewhere we could have actually ended up staying for a few more days,",1
1452,) Again in fairness it was about the same as first class on a train so there really isn't too much room to complain here.,0
1453, The total head room was 60 - 70cm (give or take - it was the height of Russell's forearm and then a third again) which meant that there was very little head room to move in and certainly no room to even sit.,1
1454,Getting off at the wrong stop in the morning was only a minor detail and a 1200rupee taxi ride across town.,1
1455, So far it's been hiding in the room for 3 hours.,1
1456,The vibe of the city is entirely like anything we have been in during our stay in India and we would have happily spent another couple of days looking around here.,1
1457,Sorry no photos for all of the above - didn't really get organized for this one.,1
1458, Our rooms also took a dive bomb.,0
1459," My aunt uncle and cousin are all staying with us though,",1
