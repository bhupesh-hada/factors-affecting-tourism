0," showing it how noise is made when it puts its paw on the keys,",0
1, A huge percentage of the population don't even have any sort of bank cards.,1
2,The sole reason I wanted to visit Karnala was because four-horned antelope (chousingha) are found here.,0
3, I think the Indian Mammal Field Guide includes these particular langurs as within the range of black-footed grey langurs (that author doesn't recognise the Southern Plains species) but they look very different.,1
4,beautifully maintained.,0
5, it gives a bird eye view of the building on one hand and the look of adjacent city roads on the other hand.,0
6," I just wish I felt as clean as my sleeper having for the second time in a row,",1
7,The facade of Mumbai's beautiful CST station.,0
8, you're not always dodging motorbikes and there is significantly less noise than any other place I have been to in India.,0
9, It was so unexpected with Mumbai having a population of some 21 million inhabitants.,0
10,Perhaps more annoying than the pollution however has been dealing with some of the locals.,0
11,"Cricketers play on the green field of the Oval Maidan,",1
12," he has chosen to give without expecting anything in return and was at peace with that; because even if he didn't receive anything back,",1
13," Marine Drive - as well as around the Oval Maidan - is full of beautiful art-deco buildings,",1
14," The Arabian Sea is far too polluted to go for a swim unfortunately but nevertheless this was the first time I had set foot on a beach since I was in Odessa,",1
15,"Not far from the beach is Kotachiwadi,",0
16, a peaceful hamlet of two-storey wooden mansion blocks that may have been built in the 19th century.,0
17, It was a pocket of tranquillity from the noise and chaos just outside and gives an insight into what life used to be like in Mumbai back in the day.,0
18,remember watching live broadcasts of test cricket matches from India as a kid and remembering how crazy and fanatical the crowds were - for test matches no less!,1
19," although the Indian crowd are amazingly passionate and noisy - sometimes putting the English batsmen under tremendous pressure when they were going through a tricky spell,",1
20,"With 60% of Mumbai's population - so that's 12 million people - living in slums,",0
21, This becomes apparent when we pass a filthy canal full of sewage and pollution that goes straight into the Arabian Sea.,1
22, there are just 700 toilets for half a million people that are only cleaned weekly.,0
23, They did provide some OK views over the city though.,0
24, proper umpires and everything; but all round were rogue games of cricket and football more than just encroaching on the field of play.,1
25," for a bit of a break from 'real' India as I head for the western beaches of Goa and all of the Westerners on holiday there,",1
26," After the peaceful and relaxing time in Goa,",0
27, it was to hard to dive into the noise and pollution of Mumbai.,0
28, It is a beautiful temple and we love going there.,0
29, It is a super peaceful place in the middle of the oldest part of Mumbai.,0
30, hectic - but inside it is quiet and peaceful.,0
31, we tried to be relaxed and walked to the Aeroflot check in counter.,0
32, So finally we relaxed and went for a last chai to calm down.,0
33, I reckon that India has the worst pollution I have ever seen.,0
34," shit or smoke coming off a burning mountain of trash,",1
35, I can definitely say that Indian traffic jams and the craziness of driving are on another level.,0
36," had an interesting horn that played a short,",0
37," The panoramic view from the lookout down onto the caves is magnificent as is the underrated natural scenery of steep cliffs,",1
38, waterfalls and plateaus.,0
39," clean and welcoming sanctuary for a weary traveller,",1
40,I needed to eat something before getting on the bus so I made my way through the chaos with all my shit across the road.,1
41, The lake is best viewed from below during sunset and so it was then time to trek down.,1
42," The walk was serene and beautiful and I was able to find Brahmini ducks,",1
43, The panoramic view of the lake from the top was no less picturesque.,1
44, freshened up and went out to photograph the beautiful garden of the hotel we were staying at.,1
45, One of the caves had a good place to rest where we all sat down and relaxed (Everyone sat as if expecting someone to serve food but unfortunately that did not happen).,1
46,Lonar lake is an extremely beautiful place which is a must visit for any traveler.,0
47, The sunset on the lake is a view one would cherish.,1
48, The beautifully crafted art displays our rich heritage.,1
49, a hotel away from the main roads and at a pretty calm location.,0
50, They were Buddhist rock cut caves and one of them specifically had a beautiful shrine at the end of a passageway surrounded by sculpted columns.,1
51, Revenir holidays had a pretty good swimming pool (though not very clean still good enough) and we took our time there to make full use of the facility.,1
52, But the place had a very beautiful garden and we made full use of that taking quite a few photos.,0
53, That rule has gone a long way in keeping the place pollution free and maintaining the forest in its original state.,1
54, Then we started to check off all the view points found at Matheran.,0
55, The view points offer stunning views of the hills and cities of Maharashtra.,0
56, First up was Khandala view point which was empty waiting for someone to visit it.,0
57, From him we realized that Louisa view point (one of the very famous ones) was almost right opposite to us on the other side.,1
58," On the way to our next view point,",0
59, I turned and saw one of the most beautiful panoramic view I've ever seen.,1
60," We covered few other view points one by one including the echo point (as the name suggests you can shout and hear your echo shout back at you),",1
61, one tree hill (one tree was prominent at the view point) and Charlotte lake.,1
62, We even ate a few ice golas at one of the view points which tasted awesome in the heat.,1
63, provides a very picturesque view from the top.,1
64, We bid farewell to the beautiful Matheran and then returned to Lonavala.,1
65, The place was very clean and the idols were very beautifully crafted.,1
66," Though the place would be even more beautiful during monsoon season,",1
67, Lonavala has become pretty crowded with more and more tourists while Matheran has been able to maintain a pollution free forest like environment.,1
68, There was also supposed to be a waterfall which had gone missing due to lack of rainfall with only a trickle of water falling down from the top.,0
69,"The trek was pretty scenic even in the heat,",1
70, The fort was beautiful and peaceful with a lot of greenery around even at this time of the year.,0
71, We were able to see a very picturesque view of the Ulhas river surrounded by the hills with the sun rising from its sides.,1
72,Rajmachi was a good experience and another place ticked off the list of beautiful places in India.,1
73, The trek though not very tough was pretty tiring due to the heat and I am guessing you would find a few waterfalls here and there too during monsoons.,1
74, but it took 40 because of Mumbai’s air traffic control.,0
75, the gym guy was helpful again but trying to get me to change to a new programme and I was like no… I am happy with this one and as I’m only here for another day I’m not sure your one will really be helpful to me… I arrived back in the room to get ready for work to find the attendant about to clean it… I asked him to wait 30 minutes until I left.,1
76, There were nice views though and we saw some really old classic trains.,1
77, with an infinity pool and nice views over the vineyards and into the valley below.,1
78, Sharon and I were sharing and after a quiet lunch with a bottle of Sula Brut (the fizz) we settled by the pool.,1
79," long beach at Candolin was wonderful,",0
80," with beautiful warm sea,",1
81," shacks all along the beach for beers at sunset,",1
82," buses crowded with hot passengers,",1
83," Mix in the local population using the street as their workshop to make things,",1
84,he paintings and carvings of Buddha in the Ajanta caves were spectacular and worth the long journey through the cotton and vegetable farming villages.,1
85," a quiet little café,",0
86, is best for people wanting some peace & silence.,0
87,The Bandra-Worli Sea link that leads to Haji Ali & Carter Road is a master piece and is best viewed at night.,1
88,But ‘Real Mumbai’ is best viewed & understood on its slow local or in its ‘kali-peelies’ (taxis / local cabs).,0
89,Malshej Ghatis a mountain pass nestled in the towering rough hills of the Western Ghats.,1
90, The mountain pass is about 150 KM from Mumbai & 130 KM from Pune.,0

332,"I am going to live my life with Peace and Joy,",0
333,The Asanas and Pranayama were getting progressively more advanced each day and we really started to find ourselves relaxing into the meditation sessions.,0
334," calm and even a few pounds lighter,",0
335,"Jumping in a rickshaw bound for our hotel for the night in Nasik feeling chipper and calm with the world,",1
336, and live in Peace and Joy Forever’ although it was a start!,0
337, enjoying the views from our balcony of the infinity pool and grape vines below us with nothing but the birds singing and the sound of the hotels various water fountains breaking the silence.,1
338, The complimentary evening meal added to the relaxation factor for both of us as we ate so much that evening that both of us found it hard not to pass out there and then at the table.,0
339,Our spa treatment following a few glasses of wine was as could be expected and we were about as relaxed as we have been for some time now.,1
340,Just a pinch of the rubbish by the railway tracks.,0
341,"After our nice relaxing time in Goa,",0
342, we were bracing ourselves for the worst as our next stop was one of the most populated cities on the planet…Mumbai.,0
343, beggars and people that called the station there home.,0
344, and complete chaos; however none of this was anywhere to be seen.,0
345, This varied massively as you wandered around and it has everything from tenement blocks that are on the verge of collapse to beautiful neo-gothic buildings that are stunning.,1
346, I don’t think we will ever forget some of the sad things we have seen here from babies crawling through the rubbish to a guy with a severed foot covered in flies just sitting on the street seemingly waiting for the end.,1
347," They have these beautiful man made lakes,",0
348," Pune is green and clean and still developing,",0
349,Water very murky as we sailed into port this morning - everyone warned not to swim in any of the beaches around Mumbai.,1
350, Still loads of people and beeping horns of little black and yellow taxis everywhere - bit like Bali road rules are just guidelines - they basically do what they want to and go where they want to.,0
351, the beach areas - went to a couple of markets as well including the Thieves market and Crawford market.,1
352, And it was a tiny quiet place with no white tourists.,1
353, It was quite popular for Indians though who were coming here for weekends and they gathered at only one spot of the beach which was otherwise deserted.,0
354, The beach actually looked like the ones in Goa or more precisely how Goa probably used to look like years and years ago before it was discovered by foreign tourists.,1
355,looked like they had divided the beach into separate territories.,0
356, We got to see beautiful unspoiled part of India before it gets into the attention of tourists.,1
357, and the littering is plain lazy.,1
358," We relaxed for the afternoon,",0
359, After the match we found a little restaurant where we could get a beer so ended the night relaxing with a Budweiser.,1
360, I then walked to get our tickets while Dad relaxed in our very nice executive business hotel room.,1
361," traffic chaotic as always,",0
362,flies and pollution in India not a chance I’d risk from eating at one of them.,1
363, Once again I enjoyed it as the views are impressive.,0
364," It’s advertised on the city tours etc as a place to go but it’s littered with homeless people and plastic bottles,",1
365, The same applied for the beach in Chennai.,0
366, A lot of people have headed into the city to get stuff done but my roommates and I have chosen to relax in the shade with a book.,1
367, Relaxation changed when a newbie t the ashram joined.,1
368, We will be assigned random tasks through out our stay here but for today we just have to clean up our rooms.,0
369, We had time to relax so I grabbed my book and enjoyed a cool breeze passing through until lecture time.,1
370, I am actually digging this quiet time.,0
371,The yoga this morning can be deemed relaxing if one wasn't so focused on the fact that nothing was being worked out.,1
372,Relaxation time is my favorite time.,1
373,What followed relaxation time was just as fabulous.,0
374, I don't believe in heaven but if I we to ever go to one mine would be filled with exercise equipment and food.,0
375,"Today's heaven came in the form of tomato curry,",1
376, I eventually cleaned my plate that looked as if it had been licked clean and headed over to our main building were we were to do introductions.,1
377,Karma yoga time was next and I wish I had been on tea so I could you know work out but a las I was not so instead I was assigned to clean the main hall.,1
378, mop and clean outside.,0
379,As the cleaning crew finished up the room the bell rang and we made our way over.,1
380, not to mention the screen that blocks my view so instead of taking the same seat I made my way outside.,1
381, I choose not to and instead take in the beautiful view that surrounds me.,1
382, There is a breeze to keep us cool and the view is just to fabulous to be made at the fact that my hand is burning intensely.,1
383,In between our two lectures there was lunch and relaxation time.,0
384, Relaxation was also enjoyable.,0
385, It is such a beautiful language and similar to Spanish so I am catching a few words here and there.,0
386, But both my roomies convinced me that a good round of chanting may be better to calm my mind.,1
387, I wanted to push myself and lose myself in a hard core workout but chanting was exactly what might calm my mind.,1
388,My karma yoga for the day was to clean the library.,1
389, Two of us to clean one small room.,0
390, Again I honesty can't say for sure if I stayed awake the entire time or not but when it was over I felt relaxed and ready for whatever the day would bring.,1
391,I had to clean toilets for karma yoga which may not sound that great but with three people cleaning a tiny area we were done with time to spare.,1
392, relaxed and rejuvenated.,0
393, Pat and I headed up the to so mountainous mountain to take some photos.,1
394, The walk up was easy enough and unfortunately snake less and on top the view was quite nice.,1
395,Lunch and relaxing before the exam is necessary.,0
396, For a test day it was a pretty relaxing day.,0
397, Cherry and I cleaned outside the office and my micro lesson where I got all nervous once more.,0
398, I sleep under a mosquito net and am constantly sweating my ass off.,0
399, I really don't mind the schedule but it is good to take a day to just relax slough heading into town isn't the most relaxing thing in the world.,1
400, instead I headed up the mountain to check out the sun rise.,0
401, A group of us made our way up to the top and it was a spectacular view.,1
402,Down the mountain we went to kill some time before breakfast and heading to town.,1
403," cleaning the room,",0
404, I took so many pictures of the kids jumping in the water and women cleaning clothes.,1
405," My heaven will be filled with chili,",1
406, Sitting outside I gazed at the beautiful scenery that surrounds me.,1
407,Karma yoga was cleaning the library today.,1
408, It was as of they were all in silence making the whole cleaning thing quite boring.,1
409, Not the soothing calm voice but more the fun lets work out kind of way.,0
410,Doing a round of netti to clean out our nasal passages we called it a morning and we sent to eat breakfast.,0
411,Once again I was instructed to clean the main hall.,0
412,Paresh is interesting and all but he delayed us from food and is now taking away an hour of our relax time.,0
413, It was nice coming back early and relaxing out at the picnic tables.,1
414,Time flies when your relaxing and having fun because before we knew it it was nearly sunset and we all decided to head up the hill to check it out the first time wasn't all that spectacular but this one certainly made up for it.,1
415, With just a smidge of light left we made our way back down the mountain for dinner.,0
416,Up the mountain we all went to enjoy the sunset before dinner and celebrate the beginning of the end.,1
417, Off I went in the unnatural calm voice that is required of a yoga teacher.,1
418, Sure during micro lessons I had learned that my spunky upbeat energetic voice was a nice niche in the calm yoga atmosphere here but since I was being graded on a soothing voice I tried to tone it down and leave out words such as janky.,0
419,And afternoon of relaxation plus a half hour of good old yoga nidra which had exited our lives far to early especially during exam time when we need it most.,1
420, I had intended to climb the mountain with Max but couldn't find him so Pilates seemed like the only logical choice so that is what I did before dinner.,1
421, It was nice to relax and by relax I mean do some Pilates before heading up to see the sunset once more.,0
422, They were cut into a huge mountain and has lots of Buddhist cut outs in the side of them.,1
423, I had never seen rooms the size of these suites with wonderful views of the water and the queens necklace promenade around the hotel.,1
424, Rooms ranged from luxury city view to presidential suite.,1
425, What was interesting is that only about half of them have side view mirrors.,1
426, One cannot tell if the side view mirror helps or not because we kept our eyes closed most of the time.,1
427," Horns are blowing constantly because not only are there the cars (mainly taxis) on the streets,",0
428, One of the most beautiful synagogues was one called the Kenneseth Eliyahoo which had beautiful interiors.,0
429, It was truly a beautiful building.,1
430, skill and luck with traffic lights as a guide.,1
431, At least the seas are calm and our cruise continues.,1
432, beautifully dressed women and more life in some streets than some cities might have.,1
433, since everything looked so different and chaotic and I thought for sure we would get lost.,1
434, which is this pool of clean fresh water that Pratik said nobody knew where the water truly comes from.,1
435," these were really spectacular to see,",1
436, as well as the crowds of monkeys trying to steal people's food and drinks.,1
437, with a population of twenty two million plus.,0
438," we had a view of the bay from our room,",1
439," and spent our evenings blissed out by the beauty of all the boats sparkling in the water from the hotel's excellent rooftop restaurant,",1
440,This was the bay view from our hotel room.,1
441," In addition to getting the historical background on some of the beautiful architecture in old Mumbai,",1
442," Along with a collection of photos and beautifully done dioramas depicting the events of his life,",1
443,"The walking tour was a great intro to this beautiful city,",0
444," strolling the massive Chapatti Beach in the heart of the city; the enormous sea wall that extends for miles along Marine Drive,",1
445," referred to as """"The Queen's Necklace"""" because of the Bay's shape when lit at night; and the cricket fields that were always full of activity.",1
446, only go to watch the apparently hilarious Indian audience that is anything but quiet during the movies.,0
447, populate the biggest slum in Asia.,0
448," It's a city who's population has swollen beyond the perameters of human decency,",0
449, apparently - and was hit instantly by the muggy heat that only a polluted inner city can generate.,0
450, It was also very quiet - where were all the car horns!,0
451, buses and trucks to burst from behind me and engulf me in their chaotic hordes.,1
452, Every single piece of scrap material or rubbish had been collected and was being laoriously sub-divded into towering piles of colourful trash on either side of the street.,1
453, I asked to be lead out of the slum to the public access point (a bridge over the tracks) and the kid jumped away again through the traffic of people.,1
454," friendly and clean (""""India clean"""",",1
455, enough of excitement for a twelve year old as we inched through loads of traffic on the way to the international airport to catch an air india flight to rome.,1
456, In spite of being the largest population in the world I could observed that they were polite and a little more organized and less rude than their fellow Chinese neighbors.,0
457, We got to the ashram at 2:30 AM and I got my room (very basic) and fell asleep to some soft calming music.,1
458, but very little came out and the weather was not warm since the ashram is in the mountains on the outskirts of Mumbai.,1
459, neck and face felt so un stressful and relaxing I felt at ease.,1
460, The only problem I found was that after the massage my hair was so oily and it was really hard to get it cleaned without hot water.,1
461,I ate breakfast and then went for a calming morning walk around the ashram.,0
462, It was a peaceful calm neighborhood in spite of being only about 5 minutes from the main street to the town.,1
463, I felt relaxed and ready for my last day of yoga and meditation a the ashram and for he beginning of a fun adventurous trip through the desert of India with Kyle.,1
464, The class started like usual some meditation and relaxing poses and exercises.,0
465, The practice went like the other ones for most of the time and when it was almost time to finished about 15 minutes before the teacher asked us to lay down in shavasana (relaxing pose) and close our eyes feel our breath and simply put our mind in blank.,0
466, I went to bed feeling so better with my self at peace and calmed!,1
467, The ashram is in an area north of Mumbai in the outskirts near the mountains and so the weather can be cool specially before and after sunrise and sunset.,1
468, I felt so great and at peace that the morning yoga practice went through so easily and naturally.,1
469, which I have to say was really relaxing and helped stretch and learn basic poses I felt light and so thankful for this experience.,1
470,After breakfast I took a short walk and read a book my mom gave me about ideas to live a healthy happy life and to find yourself and I also read a book about India called: Behind beautiful forevers.,1
471,My naturopathy treatment was at 10:30 and it was a relaxing leg massage.,1
472, it was so relaxing I fell deeply asleep and woke up at 3:20 and almost missed my naturopathy treatment.,1
473, Traffic here makes a Monday morning rush-hour on London's M25 seem like an afternoon picnic.,0
474, throw in the odd cow and goat for good measure and many thousands of black and yellow taxis honking ' I'm behind you!,1
475, to absorb the ambience of the affluent over a welcome cool beer at European prices.,1
476," more than 50% of Mumbai's population still live in slums around the city,",0
477," up steep steel staircases to corrugated roofs scattered with yesterday's rubbish and kids playing cricket,",1
478, but it is equally reality that these seemingly happy people are cleaning up this world we contiue to pollute with our consumer driven trash.,0
479,• Immediately there will be a small waterfall (it was dry in winter) on your left.,0
480,• Take the waterfall route.,0
481," The wall on the other side of the fort has some nice views of lonawala,",0
482, this is one of the most heavily-populated metropolitan areas in the world with over 20.,0
483," that's more than the populations of London,",0
484, limited educational opportunities and unemployment are all familiar scenes to the half of this city’s population which lives in a slum dwelling of some sort.,1
485, Dharavi’s population of over a million live cheek by jowl on about one square mile of land that was once a mangrove swamp.,1
486, I find it to be one of the most inspiring places I've ever been to anywhere in the world and firmly believe all visitors should see it first-hand if they’re to experience a balanced view of life here in Mumbai.,1
487, cleans them inside and out and sprays them with red oxide paint to be reprinted with another brand name and refilled.,1
488, there are places where open sewers scent the air and rubbish sits in piles waiting never to be collected.,0
489, as there are reports of a tiger being spotted not far away from the Fort by workers cleaning it up the day before.,1
490, in addition to the English toast and eggs with jam etc.,1
491, It’s quite spectacular and one can’t help marvelling at the vision and craftsmanship of generations of devotees whose painstaking work is preserved and enjoyed even today.,1
492,There is the opportunity to get a view from the top perimeter of the cave which gives it a sense of scale and grandeur.,1
493, It is really a special place and reasonably well kept having been literally sculptured out of the mountain face and put up with hordes of visitors over centuries.,1
494," We stop to clean up - the culprit,",0
495,Once again in need of a beer after all the walking and viewing we hit the MTDC Resort for lunch – Kangaroo beer (!,1
496,so dirty and traffic congested as other cities and many of the neighbourhoods – such as where Shobha lives – are very pleasant with neighbourhood shops and facilities.,1
497, Baggage claim was a rather chaotic introduction to the “every man for himself” attitude that many Indians possess when it comes to waiting in lines.,1
498, We spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing and planning our travels through India.,0
499,"enjoying the quiet neighborhood atmosphere,",1
500, located right near the famous Gateway to India monument with a fantastic view of the Arabian Sea.,1

519,o(MISSING)f the population practicing the Hindu religion.,0
520, I didn’t know this before but India has the third largest Muslim population in the world.,1
521,I wonder if the Muslim and Hindu populations are peaceful.,0
522," In the prolouge of her book Behind Beautiful Forevers,",1
523, This was rural Uganda where the land provided the food so in some ways these shoeless beautiful children were lucky because they also came to school with mangos and avocados that were grown on the same land they live on.,1
524,o(MISSING)f India's population lives in rural areas.,1
525, Health care is scarce in the rural parts of India which causes many problems for rural Indians like many rural populations worldwide.,1

527,o(MISSING)f Mumbai's population lives in slums.,0
528,o(MISSING)f the population of Mumbai living on only 6%!,0
529, Entire fields piled high with trash.,0
530, This information is consistent with the book mentioned earlier Behind Beautiful Forevers by Katherine Boo.,1
531," But not everyone made the guest list: more than half of the population lives in slums,",1
532, And maybe one of the beautiful and bright children who receive and education whether it is through public school or Aseema itself will grow up and make changes in their country.,1
533, India is a beautiful country with its own unique ways of living and its own unique problems.,0

536," butterflies and elusive wild leopards replace pollution and crowds,",1
537,The weekend was fast approaching so I decided to catch a flight out of town and find a less populated area with less smoke.,1
538, The other was just an hour away by air and in a low population density area of India--perfect for my low pollution needs.,0
539,"If you have further interest in the origin of these beautiful caves,",0

611, narrow and bustling streets appear to be chaotic but a deeper look and you see that the market streets are areas of ordered chaos - very complex systems that work.,0
