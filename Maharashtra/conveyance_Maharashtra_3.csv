0,"The Agumbe-Udupi road was closed for vehicles,",0
1, I got a lift down this road to the village of Someshwara which is on the bottom end of the wildlife reserve (9km from Agumbe).,1
2, There are trains from Udupi to Mumbai but all seats were booked for the next couple of days.,0
3,"In Ankola I stayed at the Radha Krishna Lodge which is across the road from the bus station and had a relatively amusing name,",1
4,The nearest train station to my hotel was the Sandhurst Road Station.,1
5, Sewri Station is just four stops along from the Sandhurst Road Station - the ticket costs just five rupees - and once there you just cross the tracks and find one of the roads heading east.,1
6," There's an actual road-crossing at the station from which you just keep walking until you hit a T-junction (and then turn right) but I followed some other local people across the tracks themselves and went along a smaller road,",1
7,To fill in the day I took a taxi from by the train station to the Byculla Zoo which was not what I was expecting from a zoo in Mumbai.,0
8, which is an hour south by train so you need to start early.,0
9," I got to the Sandhurst Road Station at 6am,",0
10, and the ticket guy told me that train coming into the station right now goes to Panvel.,0
11," I had to go all the way back to Sandhurst Road Station,",0
12, to wait for the next train which really went to Panvel.,0
13,30am I was only just leaving (again) Sandhurst Road at that time.,0
14, it gives a bird eye view of the building on one hand and the look of adjacent city roads on the other hand.,1
15," caught a night bus straight after a journey from somewhere else during the day,",0
16," I don't think I have ever seen so many homeless people; it got to the point where I had to wheel my backpack on the road because there would have been too many sleeping homeless people - and at that time of the morning,",0
17," Mumbai's architectural highlights include the old Victoria train station - much more ornate than its London namesake - now called the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus,",1
18, We took a rickshaw to Andheri train station.,0
19, We watched the life there for a while before taking our train back to Andheri and then the taxi to the airport.,0
20," a """"fun"""" journey back home started.",0
21," and even when I realised thanks to transport connections that it sorta wasn't,",0
22, I was thus left completely at the mercy of a tuk-tuk driver with the bus having dropped me on a road on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.,0
23, dusty road where I would have to wait a further hour and a half.,0
24, before we somehow managed to squeeze eight people including all our luggage into a tuk-tuk for a short ride up the road to our actual bus.,1
25," Indian roads and the relative age of the bus ensured a bumpy,",1
26, The only problem was that I hadn't booked any transport there - I was going to catch a bus to Aurangabad and rely on a private bus company to have space in one of their overnight buses going to Mumbai (which I was fairly confident one of them would).,1
27, I could even possibly catch a same-day train in the afternoon.,0
28," train station and private bus companies are all within a square kilometre in Aurangabad which will make things easier - I don't usually leave things up to chance like this but like I said at the start of this entry,",0
29," I decide to walk to the train station,",0
30, I had almost certainly missed the same-day train to Mumbai and it would have been by far the most comfortable way to get to Mumbai and I was a little annoyed at myself that I somehow missed booking this connection.,0
31, I decided to give up - I wasn't likely to get a space on board the trains that night and I was getting sick of standing in that queue.,0
32,Leaving the train station I rock up to the first travel agency that I come to and book a sleeper bus to Mumbai.,1
33,The first destination was Lonavala and the to journey was an overnight one.,0
34, We kept chatting through the journey trying to fill in the missing pieces after we had parted post 2nd year Pre-University completion.,1
35, Umesh and Safal went to get our XUV (booked through Zoom cars) which would be our mode of transport for the next 3 days.,1
36, On the way we stopped along the highway so that others could have breakfast and also bought some supplies.,1
37, a hotel away from the main roads and at a pretty calm location.,0
38, was all ready to train for the Olympics.,0
39, While returning we caught a glimpse of the toy train at the railway station.,1
40, we met at the Lingampally station to catch the train to Karjat.,1
41,met the trek co-ordinators and were told that we did not have enough seats in the train and would have to adjust with a few RAC's.,1
42, This was not unexpected as it is not easy to book train tickets and a few others from the trek group were also in a similar situation.,1
43,That ended most of the action in our trip and the rest of it was just the usual wait for the train and then back to Hyderabad after a weekend well spent.,0
44, I fell asleep on the journey to work again… I don’t think I’m eating enough on this new exercise regime but it’s hard being away in hotels.,1
45, I really enjoyed sitting in the office as Mumbai’s famous commuter trains could be heard rumbling past… (and I could see them if I looked out the window at the right time).,1
46, I’ve been told that if you stand 5 metres away from the door you won’t have to walk onto the train… you just get kind of carried in by the crowd.,0
47, They were massive but I wasn’t quick enough to get a picture (I got some later on the journey to Nashik because we followed them for miles).,0

57,"We worked out from the timetable that it would be better to get off the train at the 2nd Goa station,",0
58,"Visiting the caves involved a long car journey of 2 hours each way,",1
59, on the long distance roads at speed it can be quite scary.,0
60,he paintings and carvings of Buddha in the Ajanta caves were spectacular and worth the long journey through the cotton and vegetable farming villages.,1
61, The entire stretch of the road next to the sea that leads to Marine drive & Chowpatty is on a steam all night.,1
62,The Bandra-Worli Sea link that leads to Haji Ali & Carter Road is a master piece and is best viewed at night.,1
63, Carter Road is a great place to hang out & eat or to just sit & watch the sea come & go!,0
64, curvy road with deep valleys & numerous blind spots & sharp turns.,0
65," the roads are well-made,",0
66,It is definitely more about the journey than the destination itself!,0
67," Venture south via metro & train to visit a couple of art galleries,",1

69, finish the evening with a decent feed and a kingfisher before catching my night train to south Goa.,1

82, After 2 hours enjoying the peace it was time to take the ferry and train back to Andheri.,1
83, From the train station in Andheri Nina went directly again to the ISKCON Temple for a final aarti in India and some nice food.,1
84, Furtheron we went over the Victoria Bridge to the Sundar Narayan Temple and than to the MG Road area with lot of shops and stall everywhere.,0
85, Going with public transport from Bijapur to Aurangabad is not common (needless to say that a Lonely Planet not even thinks about such an option).,0
86, By train we left Bijapur around sunset.,0
87,"After doing few short road trips around Pune,",0
88, it was time to do one long road trip.,0
89, let's plan for this road trip.,0
90, I booked train tickets for my parents in such a way that they would leave at least 2 hrs before me.,1

99," Case in point: a sign posted at one of the last stops we made on the journey back to Pune—""""Save Earth - Save Water - Use Disposable""""—say what?",1
100, We knew that it would be a good drive with good roads and greenery but didn't expect to land up in a rare taken road with the whole tapola lake just for ourselves.,0
101, We did see them all from a distance though and did try to drive until Pavana- but the road was atrocious and returned when we were 3 km away from the lake.,1
102, The drive to work in the morning was probably only a couple of kms but it would take 30-45 minutes due to the bad roads and traffic congestion.,0
103," We took a train to South Mumbai,",0
104, Taking the train is an adventure on its own.,0
105, even when the train is moving.,0
106, an average of 10 people die every day on the trains in and around Mumbai.,0
107, We arrived at the station and went down on the platform just when a train was leaving.,0

115, First stop to tank up the fuel off course out of corporation limits to save some bucks and started again with full energy to explore Hinjewadi – Pirangut road and then grand Tamhini.,1
116,roads being repaired and to my little surprise roads are now really made like national highways.,0

119," there are two roads to Dive Agar,",1
120," First phase of road is again bad and rough,",0
121, but from Srivardhan about 10Kms of patch is coastal road and is awesome.,0
122, To give you a glimpse of chat with vendor about Mangaon – It’s a small emerging town of Raigad district about 190 Kms from Mumbai and 112 Kms from Pune located on Mumbai – Goa Highway and crucial station for Konkan railway.,0
123,This road trip gave confidence in driving my Fiesta in rough and hilly roads – next is the plan for Coastal Karnataka road trip.,0
124," On the journey back on the last day in Mumbai for this trip,",0
125, roads became better and you see some dams on your way!,1
126, Most of the sights are within walking distance or easily reached by train (the station is close by).,0

128," As we were at the train station,",0
129, we took the train down south to the Marine Lines Train Station.,0

132,"we travelled down to the Churchgate Train Station and walked to Colaba,",0
133," It was a very easy journey that cost 60 rupees each,",1
134, Markus will join me for the last days of the treatment and after we will go on the road together for another 3 weeks.,1
135, The journey was about 30 minutes in rush hour and finally it cost me 200 IR in total.,1
136," Upon reaching the train station,",0
137, I even thought of asking the ticketing staff to downgrade my ticket to its original class but I figured out that it wouldn't be possible because the train was full.,1
138," The Deccan Queen express is Indian railway's one of the most prestigious trains - first chugged out on June 1st,",1
139," the train departed on time at 5:10PM however,",0
140, the train didn't even notch up to 90 KMPH for most of the time except at some places where it did cross 100 KMPH mark briefly.,1

145,"The return journey to Mumbai was awful because I had boarded a super crowded train and for over 7 hours I couldn't move an inch as a result suffered from severe back pain and muscle cramps,",0
146, I was lucky that I didn't fall off of the train despite almost sleeping away for a few minutes with a force of hundreds of people pushing me outside.,1
147, and complete chaos yet everybody reached their destination on time - the train was not even delayed by a minute.,0
148," I finally saw a road going somewhat downhill and as i started riding down that road,",1
149, for the road that i just came down was a one way again.,0
150," I rode along the road and kept following it to the end,",0
151, Took a ferry to Alibag which cut a 3 hour road journey to 45 mins boat ride.,1
152," Roads are v congested,",0
153, pedestrian crossing points are far and few between so people just walk in the road and cross whenever.,0
154, We rode on the highway towards South West Mumbai.,0
155, We got to the main town and walked through alleys and dirt roads which seemed to have put a stop on the clock and it looked like an old 60s town.,1
156,The road was filled with food vendors and locals and a bunch of rickshaws carrying on the roof about 3-5 rafts.,1
157,"Mumbai is basically fucking London's buildings with Indian roads Inbetween,",0
158,"Second day I literally just sat around playing football manager in the hotel waiting for my 11pm train to Goa,",1
159, Till rajgurunagar (from Pune) the road will be good after that you can't expect a smooth ride.,1
160," help book train or bus tickets to your next destination,",0
161, It is only about a 40 minute auto rickshaw and train ride to the tourist area.,0
162, I’ve been training to be an Iyengar yoga teacher since 2012 and with any luck will be certified this October when I sit for the certifying assessment in Sydney.,0
163,I used to think I was awesome at yoga before I started this yoga teacher training thing – now I know I kinda suck and that’s an improvement on the way I was practicing before.,0
164, by bus or train and maybe the odd boat or ferry.,0
165,Mahesh didnt took long and after picking him up we resumed our journey towards Mahad which is another 80 km approx from there.,1
166,Base of the fort is around 25 kms from the hotel but the road is bumpy at places so it takes you around 70-90 mins to reach there.,0
167,"its On highway few kms from Mahad,",0
168,Road in patches was rough.,0
169," but the roads here are much worse) for most of the day,",0
170," The journey was made longer by the fact that there were virtually no signs to show the way to the lodge,",1
171, We set off back towards the gate when on a wide metalled forest road our progress is halted as there are three Gypsies in front with people photographing some wild dogs in the brush to the side of the road ahead of us.,1
172,Then for some reason our tracker chooses that moment to turn around and look back down the road and all hell breaks loose.,0
173," Suddenly she looks back down the road and sees a wild dog advancing towards us,",0
174, They trot down the road oblivious to the danger.,0
175,And then before you know it it’s the last train journey the last city you will visit in India and the last days and hours.,1
176, The train journey was lovely the country side was very hilly we seemed to be going up into the mountains passing through great valleys.,0
177," What I love about Indian trains is that you are constantly plied with drinks and food as well as that you can order breakfast,",0
178, The Mumbai train station- the Victoria Terminus - has got to be one of the most beautiful train station the world and looks more like a Gothic palace than a train station.,1
179, and of course once again crammed to the hilt – I wish I could transport you all for the sounds and smells (ok so some of the smells not that great) often of burning incense which can only mean two things food stalls or temples.,0
180,I have loved my time here and hope to tell you all in person all the wonderful things about this journey that I have forgotten in this blog– the little snippets and cameos that hopefully I would have captured in my pictures – and of course Terry’s.,1
181, We went further along the road than we had ever been and it was in a part of the village I had not been to and never knew existed.,1
182, Swam at every opportunity as the water was warm and mostly flat and before I knew it we were back on the train making our way to Pune.,1
183, We had to get off at 4 am in the morning and it was the busiest train station we have been to.,1
184, trains coming and going.,0
185, Our time flew by and once again it was time to pack our bags ready for the morning sitter train to Mumbai and coming to he end of our journey.,0
186, At the dock you walk a ways then there is a train- it was only something like 10 rupees to ride but I figured it was lazy to ride when you could easily walk.,0
187," if there is a form of transportation offered ,",0
188, For Ellora we hired a taxi and with the same taxi we reached to Manmad for the train to N.,0
189, We left Kumily and after a stressful few connections through Kottayam and Ernakulam - we nearly missed the train as our bus and taxi were being held up by traffic!,0
190," We got an overnight train back up to Goa,",0
191, we had a hellish train ride back yesterday - 7 hours in an unbelievably packed carriage - people were sitting on each other and we nearly got crushed as we boarded.,0
192, local transport is mental here.,0
193,"After catching the train to Colaba,",0
194, whilst on his journey to rescue his wife Sita.,1
195," The road trip itself was fun too,",0
196,"The journey to Elephanta Island was quite a trek,",0
197," train to Colaba,",0
198, This was my first experience of a train journey in India.,0
199, which is good as I have heard that trains can be very dangerous here.,0
200, but I still really enjoyed the journey to Colaba as I got to see more of the city.,0
201," Hungry from the first part of our journey we decided to stop for food at Leopolds cafe,",1
202," and even though the journey there is so long,",0
203," winding mountain road the views became increasingly impressive: mist and clouds hanging low over the lush green peaks,",1
204, Another thing that struck me on that first car journey was seeing the poverty.,0
205, rows of families sleeping at the edges of main roads with nothing to use for shelter.,0
206, I have spent most of these journeys gazing out of the window in complete awe of my surroundings.,0
207, however the trains heading into and out of Mumbai were more frequent and therefore it just made more logistical sense to do it this way.,0
208,"Our train into Mumbai would take us back to good old CST where we first entered Mumbai on the previous journey,",1
209, so we were prepared for a hefty fare as this time we were heading north close to Mumbai Central train station where our train would depart from the following evening heading North to Jaipur.,1
210,poorly paved roads with a real sense of speed as we left the area of Fort in the South of Mumbai.,0
211,It was around an hour later when we started to wonder why this journey was taking so long.,0
212, The first thing that caught my eye was a train station named Kurla….,0
213,"Boarding out train to Jaipur,",0
214, chilled out and decided on going to see Bibi-qa-Maqbara 20 minutes down the road from where we were staying in Aurangabad.,0
215, and despite the torrential downpour along the appallingly maintained main highway to Ajanta we were ready to make our own minds up to which we preferred.,0
216," The 100km journey would take us around 2 and a half hours due to the pothole dodging,",0
217," Thankfully this journey would only provide a few heart pumping moments for us,",0
218,"The journey to Ellora from Aurangabad is quite a scenic one once you get out from the city,",1
219,2) We shop on mall road for salwar suits and fruit barfi.,1
220," the drive through those tiny roads that takes you to this place offer all once you start approaching Ozar (Ashtavinayak Ganapati),",0
221, and the road didn't disappoint me even for a moment.,0
222," Then came """"Randha waterfalls"""" and this was the first place on our journey where we saw a lots of people,",1
223, As we were admiring several waterfalls at this place the rain started and then never stopped for us till we started our journey back from Ratanwadi.,1
224," Though the road is in a very bad shape,",0
225,I’ll start by defending our massive disregard for the rules of the road whilst backpacking and hence why we chose to head off to the fantastic ‘Beyond@ Sula Vineyard’ resort in Nasik.,0
226, and so we boarded the train and headed north.,0
227, having had a decent sleep and didn’t even stir when everyone else left the train after arriving.,1
228, The roads are fine and places like German bakery are very cosmopolitan places to hang out in.,1
229, Still loads of people and beeping horns of little black and yellow taxis everywhere - bit like Bali road rules are just guidelines - they basically do what they want to and go where they want to.,0
230, First we were thinking about going to Goa but that was a little bit of crazy idea considering that we had just 4 days including the journey and flight tickets were extremely expensive.,1
231, not having to bribe the security guys who insisted I have to pay to get back and I found a travel agency which got us a car with a driver for our journey to Kashid for a reasonable price.,1
232, he was expecting it to be shorter journey as well.,1
233,So Friday morning I had the pleasure of walking up knowing I only had a few hours before a mammoth 26 hour train journey to Mumbai to get.,1
234,"I headed to the station a good hour before the train as I know the things are huge,",0
235, I got onto the train and went to my ‘sleeper.,0
236, especially on moving transport as a jolt means it goes everywhere.,0
237, and had a few scoops before heading to sleep with an early train in the morning.,0
238,by a 4 hour train to Pune.,0
239, It was obviously uncomfortable and hot as Indian trains always are and we were in second class seating (cheap seats).,1
240, After a bit of a tiff on the side of the road we got in a rickshaw.,0
241,transport links to it.,0
242, 2 off those and a curry and we headed to train station to find a cab.,1
243," There are plenty of road side stalls but with the dirt,",0
244,Friday all we did was get some food and hang around until our train back to Mumbai.,0
245," In the evenings I went about 2 doors down the road to a place called Cafe Universal and sat there eating,",0
246,I had booked a train months ago for Wednesday to Delhi.,1
247," Having done the Chennai-Mumbai trip on sleeper class I tried to book a new train to Delhi in 2AC class which is far nicer however 4 times the price,",1
248,"not enough to make the train so I knew I’d have to wait an extra day in Mumbai and go cattle class,",1
249, hence why I’d tried booking an earlier train in a nicer class.,1
250, It seems a strange book to read here but after such a spiritual journey book such as The Alchemist I felt the need to get back to some reality and science.,0
251, Instead Max gave me an Italian lesson which was just as good and then we hit the road back home.,0
252, After tea we all sat through those last two lessons of our yoga teaching training and two hours later we were sort of free.,0
253, From there far to many people from my yogi family will head out to continue their journeys onward or back home.,0
254,During the day we also saw the Victoria Terminas which is one of the largest train stations in the world.,0
255, India has an amazing train system which has developed over hundreds of years.,1
256," Our drive to the Cinema Hall passes Victoria Terminus (the magnificent British built train station),",0
257, that local trains run every 2 minutes and stop for only 17 seconds.,0
258," transported to the port,",0
259," we took a train that had no doors,",0
260,"We went back to the hostel with intentions of booking a train ticket to Goa but instead fell asleep for 4 hours,",1
261,The next day the hostel staff told us that the trains to Goa were fully booked but they found us a night-bus that we could take that evening.,1
262, We continued our walk passing India´s and possibly Asia´s largest and busiest train station.,1
263," I stepped off the train at midnight onto the empty platfrom of Mumbai's Victoria Terminus - the busiest train station in Asia,",1
264, The most impressive of all the buildings is the train terminus that I'd blindly left the evening before.,0
265," I bravely commanded a spot in the middle of the wide road to take anoptimally angled photograph of the front of the building only for a rage of taxis,",0
266, I took the new suburban train service to the nearest station.,1
267, The squat slum settlements that illegelly but indefatigabally line the rail lines whizzed past as I hung out of the open doors to enjoy the cooling breeze (still a novelty and one that I'll miss when I return to the tragic Southeastern train service of Kent).,1
268, and consequently came within 3 or 4 seconds of being obliterated by a train - they are surprisingly quiet!,0
269," on the return journey dad was waiting for us at the airport as mom,",0
270, we left for mumbai by train and one of the friends uncle met us at dadar station and we walked down to a guest house nearby.,1
271, we stayed at the ywca international guest house on madame cama road and this would be one of several trips to the ywca.,1
272, i moved into a sharing accommodation and settled into a routine job for all of five months before moving into my uncles house in carter road and moving back to kolkata.,0
273, living in mumbai was a bit overwhelming and i now realise i just didnt have it in me to travel by local trains and live in a pg for months at end until i found my groove.,0
274, on one of these trips i would travel all the way to bandra kurla to catch a train back home.,0
275, some strange impact and circular life forces would compel me to make this journey and theres not much to write about it.,0
276,5 hour journey through Mumbai's slums and to the ashram started.,0
