72, Middling case would be that the ATMs work but only for limited-amount withdrawals - they were talking about daily limits of 2000 rupees (about NZ$40) - which could mean either the same as the worst case situation or perhaps it would be workable.,1

393, I seriously don’t understand why the government department managing Buses on highway want’s people to take that much of pain.,1

557," The waiting staff walked around replenishing each curry as soon you finished eating it,",0
558, and I began to wish I was still on the morning train (train travel is far more comfortable than sitting in a minibus climbing a mountain road).,1

575,"We checked into our hotel – Hotel Nahar Nilgiris,",0
576," The rooms were very comfortable and large,",0
577," but given it was quite cold here with no in-room heating,",1

587,We then walked back towards our hotel with a scheduled stop at Hotel Alagapuri's Family bar to have a few drinks for Damien's birthday.,1
588,Later that evening we boarded auto rickshaws (motorised tricycles with a passenger cabin) for the short but cold drive to Fortune Resort Hotel.,1
589, Brian and I had trawled a few cake shops until Karni found a suitably showy white chocolate cake for Damien's birthday.,1
590, and dinner at the hotel was a lovely way to finish our two day stay in Ooty.,0
591, We hope we didn't keep the whole hotel floor up with our music and laughter.,1

601, We waited in vain as it never came.,0
602,"after we phoned the hotel it was of no avail,",0
603, so we just found an old taxi that looked like an exact replica of the taxi cabs in London.,1
604, but found out that it was not enough to cover the cab fare.,1
605, but it looked just like a standard hotel to us.,0
606, We had an early dinner at the hotel and turned in early that first night as we had planned to take the bus to Pondicherry the next day.,0
607,say though that the park was well maintained and looked quite clean.,0

611, I have always managed to put on a straight face.,1

615," The price was very cheap also,",0
616, For a small shop it had a wide selection of confectionaries and snacks available at reasonable prices.,1

628,"We stayed in ‘Eternity’,",0
629, We swam in a marble-lined fresh water swimming pool every morning and listened to a frog chorus every night.,1
630, Eventually it passed and we moved on to Chidambaram where we stayed in a grotty hole and saw a lovely temple with a fire ceremony.,1
631, we treated ourselves to a lunchtime super strong beer in the seedy underworld of legitimate drinking in Tamil Nadu and repeated this later this some Londoners we met at our hotel in an even dingier bar.,1
632, The sight of villagers with their towels wrapped around their heads in an effort to save themselves from the hot coastal sun reminded me that the bus is air-conditioned and what looks beautiful to me from my comfortable seat has a very different reality.,1
633, small towns and luxury beach resorts (I guess it is too tempting to leave such a locale unexploited for commercial ventures.,1
634, I initially mistook the resorts for private properties and wished if I could own one).,1
635, I was slightly disappointed and had doubts about being in the right place.,1
636," with the guest rooms spread across the compound,",1
637," the manager of the guest house was mild mannered,",1
638, I might need to use the landline in my room and informed me the call charges.,0
639," My room with 2 beds,",0
640, I sat down with the information pamphlet and the Auroville map provided to me to create an itinerary for my stay.,1
641, lectures and like at Auroville and intended to go leave this place with more information about Rishi Aurobindo and The Mother.,1
642, was on a holiday and had planned a long stay at Auroville.,1
643," Add the air-conditioning and the comfortable cushions that you are given to sit,",0
644, The petal contained a meditation room (air-conditioned with the same dreamy ambience as the inner chamber).,1
645, window shopping at the expensive boutiques and sipping coffee with biscuits at the coffee shop.,1
646, However I was comforted when he remarked that he was amazed how clean the white shirts and the white dhotis of the local people given that they seemed to travel and live in such conditions.,1
647, The private chambers of the house (Aurobindo’s room on the 1st floor and Mother’s on the 2nd floor) are not accessible without application and subsequent permission.,1
648, He was surprised and delighted to see most of the streets named in French and the restaurants and hotels similarly named.,1
649, that all he needs to get into that building and all his issues will be taken care of in case of any trouble.,0
650, Built in Gothic style and the red and white church looks beautiful from the inside ( The Sacred Heart Church near Egmore in Chennai was quite a disappointment and I was thought that Pondicherry might also be the same).,1
651, was a typical Indian shopping place.,1
652, Shops loudly displaying popular brands of clothing and fashion juggle for space with shops selling Indian handicrafts and carved wood items.,1
653, Laurent ended up deciding to buy a pair of denim trousers and some 20-25 mins (and 2 shops) later he got the denim he liked.,1
654, we came to a sweetmeat shop for refreshments.,1
655," It was nearing 4 and after a look-in at a book shop near the temple,",0
656, The heat had gotten to us and we hired a cab back to Auroville.,0
657, The bus would not leave for another hour and I seated myself comfortably and had some buns for lunch.,0
658," Due to the taxi strike,",0
659," They charged exorbitant rates for they knew at 11:30 PM,",0
660," no internet (barring the little I have on my phone),",1
661, I wonder if I was ever comfortable with these as a mere 5 days should not make me this uneasy.,0
662," Mitra and having seen the expensive boutiques and the coffee shops etc there,",1
663," (Had I stayed for 3 days,",0
664, if room was not comfortable?,0
665, if the current setup would have been possible for the facilities being used here to make life easier for residents have been made available in a specifically commercialized world.,1
666, It is nice if a fellow traveler allows you to have the right of way when there is only a sliver of road between two large pools of water from last nights monsoon.,1
667," We have met a family from Virginia staying here for a year,",0
668,"This week we checked out the fancy pool and the kids has lots of fun playing in the water,",1
669, allowances are made without thought and paths open up.,1
670," Where we sleep now is my idea of a the perfect room: it's uncomplicated,",1
671, this would be considered a very nice place and that is why it cost a fair amount in comparison to stay here; we subsidize the Tamil and Auroville and thus they treat us like special guests.,1
672,"we rented another scooter as I had to tie up accounting issues back in Auroville proper,",1
673," Even me in my bellow the knee shorts and modest enough t-shirts have garnered enough attention as to make some locals think they can come over and rub sand off my legs,",1
674," to hold her much to the disappointment of the young men,",1
675,"In our new neighborhood we've discovered a four lane pool at New Creation that is quite expensive to swim in,",1
676," We didn't have any luck at all in regards to finding anything on our shopping list (tiffins,",1
677, There wasn't too long in sunset and we could not have reached Ooty the same day so we decided to stay at Bandipur.,1
678, Patel had contacted a lot of hotels before setting out for the trip and was angry on me for not helping him out in the hotel finding effort.,1
679, Sadly all the resorts he had contacted were either full or non-existent.,0
680," located a resort with exactly 2 rooms vacant,",1
681, We dumped our bags in the room and set out for a tour of Bandipur sanctuary.,1
682,We gorged and guzzled at the resort and played cards in the night.,0
683, We easily found our prearranged cab driver and were excited to begin the last 3 hour leg of the trip.,1
684, He is uncertain of his surroundings and is feeling insecure and has voiced that this is especially obvious when we are in our room with quiet time.,1
685,"Wifi has been down since we arrived and internet is very spotty,",0
686," (as is electricity as it was last night when we had to sleep in a hot room without a fan),",0
687, The General Participants fly back 2 weeks today and then we will be involved in training the new National Volunteers and possibly meeting the new Team Leaders from the UK.,0
688,It has been challenging travelling between two teams and trying to give all of the volunteers the support they require especially with 11 International and 10 National volunteers requiring my attention.,1
689, Next batch they will have four team leaders and place one in each location which will make life a lot easier for everyone.,1
690, I have been lucky enough to take part in lots of events that the teams have organised and to see the needs of two very different areas.,1
691, travelling on buses alone has allowed me to have conversations (or attempt conversations) that would otherwise not have occurred and to gain more of an insight into life in Southern India today.,1
692, although still in luxury to many here.,0
693," fast internet connection,",0
694, Having this experience without having to face a few difficulties and challenges would not be the same.,1
695, The team in Vellore was lucky enough to organise a health rally in Vanjur which attracted two health inspectors as speakers and 30 members of women's self-help groups.,1
696, internet use and to use the library.,0
697,I have managed to get away for one weekend to meet up with the rest of the volunteers who are working in other parts of Tamil Nadu.,0
698," """"Sleeping can wait"""" they told me.",0
699, After the quiz we attempted to get to sleep but that was easier said then done as the festival didn't stop until well after midnight and there was no air-con in the rooms.,1
700,Carensa has had to balance the disappointment of grazing her knee badly with the celebration of becoming a member of the English Korfball squad.,1
701,Ella has really developed in confidence as the trip has progressed and has become more comfortable with the surroundings and the total change in lifestyle.,1
702, she was part of an ultra-organised and efficient leadership team.,1
703, so internet usage may be lacking.,1
704, on arrival we were informed that there were not many jobs and that 2 further holes had to be dug for a decorative arch inside the church!,1
705, this meant that it was a lot more efficient as there were fewer people so more jobs to go around and more frequent breaks!,1
706,"After waking up on Tuesday and getting ready for a morning on the project site we were informed that unfortunately due to a missing engineer we were unable to work,",1
707," We all had a tonne of fun messing about in the pool and lazing around on the grass,",0
708," Cannot wait to see you all and give Rex a massive tummy rub and """"kisses"""".",1
709, You'll be pleased to know I've managed to r shower when the water finally decides to work!,1

712, I'm having an amazing time and have actually managed to not burn as of yet!,1
713, can't wait to see you all soooon.,0
714, The girls had the luxurious however claustrophobic experience of buying their sarees and then we quickly headed back to our meeting point at the entrance of the temple.,1
715, plus electricity and therefore access to the internet has been dodgy!,1
716, Hopefully once we return from our temple visit and shopping there will be further updates.,0
717, and we all cannot wait to have a break and do some shopping.,1
718, The troops were allowed an extra hours rest to attempt to retain energy.,1
719, We managed to overcome a lack of equipment issue so everyone was working at maximum capacity.,1
720," After a good laugh we were allowed to spend some time with the local students; playing football,",0
721, This allowed the work to be completed whilst the temperature was cooler.,0
722, Due to our hard work and efforts over the past two days the teachers rewarded us by taking us all to the ice cream shop and treating us to an ice cream each.,1
723, we are currently sitting outside our rooms enjoying the night breeze playing many different games of cards.,1
724, The plane journeys went like clockwork however after arriving in Trivandrum we ended up waiting at the airport for another 4 hours waiting for the coach which did eventually turn up…9 hours later…when we had already left.,1
725, This did however allow us to get an eye opening experience of an Indian taxi driving on Indian roads.,0
726,It has now been 5 weeks since I left the UK and started my summer of volunteer work in India with ICS and Restless Development.,0
727, While we had a few Tamil lessons during training I have only managed to master a few basic words and sentences and being understood is a real effort.,1
728, Sign language and mime help but the difficulty is exacerbated by the different writing and having 247 letters in the Tamil alphabet!,1
729," Sadly the first few days we suffered a cockroach infestation,",0
730, rat droppings and flooding but hopefully these are sorted now with just the odd cockroach to be seen.,0
731,During our stay in Vallipattu we worked in our teams - livelihoods and health.,1

733,Socially we were lucky enough to be invited to an Indian wedding.,1
734, When we were staying with Parameshwari Alice and I were lucky enough to try some on and realised how important they are to Indian women.,0
735, Hers were beautiful silk but we went for cheap and cheerful as it might be the one and only time we get to wear them.,0
736, who ruled Tranquebar for over 200 years.,0
737,"We stayed at the 'Bungalow on the beach',",1
738, the rooms in the hotel are not numbered; they are named after the ships that docked at Tranquebar port during its Danish past.,1
739," We stayed at the room christened as Countess Moltke on the first floor; our room overlooked the hotel's garden but a small turn around the veranda…voila,",0
740, The room had a 15-foot high ceiling with all wooden beams & battens…the door itself was 10-foot tall.,1
741," four-post solid wood cot and other furniture added a period touch to the room…the toilet was not too spacious,",1
742,I had to chase the bus and managed some space next to the driver.,0
743, The bike was in bad shape with shockers almost gone but still the guy was generous enough to take me along.,1
744," Jamuna mattur is a beautiful village and suddenly everybody was kind enough to pose for my camera right from elderly ladies who threw their sickles on ground and tucked their sarees ,",1
745, I was back at kavalur observatory at 6:00 PM and was asked to wait for another half an hour.,1
746, After it was dark we were allowed in the gates the battery of my camera was used up so can’t take the snaps.,0
747," Guys did some shopping raging from clothes,",0
748, we reached the room around seven in the evening and around eight we started again for dinner after the guys boozed.,0
749, Around four again guys started shopping and we boarded the cab around five.,1
750,There was a big crowd having fun in the small water pool they were jumping into the small pool from rock and tree which I think was not safe though I didn’t see anybody getting hurt.,1
751, After trekking for some distance we spotted a pool with aqua blue pristine water there was no garbage around and it was surrounded a lush green tree.,1
752,On the flora and fauna front the tree as green and shady which I didn’t expect initially as the hills seemed to be barren and we spotted monkey’s which were quite friendly and waiting for leftover food from the trekkers.,1
753, scooped me up in a taxi from the tiny Coimbatore airport and we were immediately on our way for a weekend trip to the Nilgiris mountain town of Ooty.,1
754,"Shopping and eating aside,",0
755," Before we were allowed to continue,",0
756, one highly recommended by the owner of the bed and breakfast we were staying at near Ooty.,0
757," we taxied our way three hours to Coimbatore,",0

759," There are shops with blue shutters downed,",1
760, we checked into the Mahe de Bourdannais room; it had a pillar and a half.,0

768, I then returned to the hotel and had a nap for a few hours before meeting up with the group again to go to a Kathakali show (yes another one!,1
769, Easier than it sounds.,0
770,After that we returned to the homestay to change and went out for a meal in the village before staying up til 1.,1
771," We arrived at our resort after lunch,",0
772, All of a sudden an angry elephant came charging out of the bushes and chased us down the road!,1
773,We returned to the resort unscathed and had dinner before disco-ing the night away.,0
774,We left the resort and drove through the Mudamalai park to Mysore.,1
775,it is a beautiful place unfortunately I cannot show any photos of the inside as no photos allowed but got a few from outside.,1
776,"In the evening it was the standard affair of dinner and then cards in Sathish's room with obviously Sathish,",1
777," Sathish and I went for brunch and then a walk round the shops with Shiv whilst he bought loads of pashminas,",1

779," I had the job of submitting volunteer data (C forms) to the government online,",1
780, It's a quiet space where each person in the circle has an opportunity to share how they are feeling or issues on their mind.,1
781, allowing people to decide how much to pay and looking at alternative ways of paying that move away from money.,1
782, but I didn't manage to finish the course as I had to help cook dinner.,1

787, We had decided to stay in town knowing that accomodation is better outside in the hills.,1
788," But as we were staying just for 1 night to get the train the next day,",0
789, it was easier to stay in a place close to the train station.,0
790, We choose the Mount View Hotel which was ok.,0
791, Afterwards we were off for a nice cool beer and finally found one in a dark hotel bar.,1
792, the station master had put us on the waiting list as the train had already been sold out.,1
793, So we wanted to make sure we could get the train by being the first ones in line for the waiting list.,0
794," For 3 hours we had to wait - well,",0
795,Once we reached Mettupalayam it was a 10 minutes walk to the bus station where we immediately got a local bus to Coimbatore where we wanted to stay for the night.,0
796, It was another hour and a short Rikhsaw ride later and we found a very pleasant hotel in one of the sideroads near the junction.,0

810, Temples within temples and queues of people lined up to be blessed by the priest inside these inner temples– for this they pay extra maybe 20 or 50 rupees depending I suppose on the holiness of the area.,1
811, Outside every temple you are sure to find them waiting to be given as offerings to the Gods.,0
812," The first thing that struck me was that the room was airy and light,",1
813, its amazing how efficient it all is and how it works.,1
814, Vijawarda station was clean and our hotel was just around the corner.,0
815, Once again we saw some amazing shops and carts selling all sorts of goods.,0
816, surprise only to find out the train was delayed a bit and then a bit longer and then even a bit longer than that all in all 4 hours later it arrived and oh we could have slept a bit longer in our nice room and had breakfast at the hotel!,1
817, We did manage to watch life for those hours and its fascinating.,0
818, Firstly they need to charge people for plastic bags.,0
819, With the time we had waiting for this train I went and got info for the next trains we were planning on taking and that would prove to be a big help.,0
820, trunks of every size all waiting to be loaded or having just been unloaded.,1
821, The Indians are a very patient bunch and they wait very patiently on the platforms in the waiting halls sitting on the floor in family groups often sharing some food – its almost like they have come here for a picnic.,1
822,We got a pre-paid rickshaw to our hotel the Ramada on Egmore and it turned out to be a great big room views not incredible more like we can see a glimpse of the city.,1

830,Dinner was on the roof top of the hotel overlooking the Madurai temple complex.,1

847, Besides I read in many blogs that the boatmen were asking extra money (300/- to 500/-) apart from the regular boating charges (150/- per hour) which you pay in the TTDC counter.,1
848, But I collected every piece of information about Pichabaram before making my trip.,1
849,We stayed in a hotel in Chidambaram.,0
850, From hotel we took a walk to the Chidambaram bus stand (half km from hotel) and asked there about Pichavaram bus.,1

855, Hand held video cameras are allowed on written request (Rs 25).,0
856, Although the ticket rates are increased the inside is not maintained properly.,1
857, While the cement boat was very much a part of the golden beach now it has been separated and the security guard did not allow us to go towards that side.,1
858, I was very disappointed and thought probably I won't see those beautiful views again.,0
859, I waited till 4 o'clock till the temple opened.,1
860, no shops and no disturbances inside.,0
861," One good thing is that photography is allowed in the premises and you can take pictures of temples,",1
862, However photography is not allowed inside the pooja places where the deities are worshiped.,0
863, There are enough space on all four sides of the tank for doing pooja and other rituals.,1
864, I was very impressed to see that there is no shops inside the temple premises.,0

926, He managed to get me wide angle lens which was enough for me to click at least a few.,0
927,I knew that Tiruvanamalai has a rail station too however the train services were not frequent and hence a ride would be nice enough to get me there.,1

929, a few shops and smiling local people.,1
930, I deiced to stay close to the main ‘Arunachaleshwara Temple’ which is just a mile away from the Main bus stand.,0

946," We did see a little decent weather here and there,",0
947, 5 minutes into our journey from the airport to our pre-booked hotel however and already it was starting to look we were in for one hell of a ride.,1
948, People I can only assume have had enough of this life and are ready to move onto the next.,1
949, this wasn’t necessarily due to the city itself as we could only muster the will to get out of the hotel once a day to either buy essentials or book train tickets etc.,1
950, we had done the usual and booked ourselves into a ‘fairly decent’ Hotel for a few nights so we could get our bearings.,0
951,"we always take after flights to a new country mainly because it’s easier to have accommodation set up for us already and when taxi or Tuk tuk drivers try to take you to their ‘friends’ hotel in exchange for some cheeky commission,",1

1060," back in cochin its A/C rooms that are of demand,",0
1061," and we didn’t think that half an hour would be long enough to enjoy the temple,",0
1062, so we decided to stay and see the temple we had accidently visited.,0
1063, What must have been thousands of people were winding their way through security and a shoe drop-off (visitors are not allowed to take their shoes or their cameras into the temple).,0
1064, but slowly enough to put coins in the collection box.,1
1065, pausing only long enough for a glance.,0

1071,They incidentaly have just returned from their family holiday but in spite of that they offered their help to drop us to airport in case taxies are not running.,1
1072,Next day morning they came to our place but fortunately the cab driver called up and said he is ready to drop us to airport.,0
1073,We got refreshed and contacted the taxi driver that we have booked with the Sun Valley Homestay.,1
1074,"They greeted us with warm welcome and after quick check in we stepped into our room named """"Clarke Quay"""".",1
1075, All the 12 rooms there are named after places/monuments in Singapore.,0
1076,Rooms were big and had balcony.,0
1077,Plus they have made very clever use of mirrors so the rooms appears bigger than actual.,1
1078,Plus decent cold in the air.,1
1079, i would rate Sims Park higher simply b'use its better maintained than Ooty.,1
1080,Apparently its the only operational tea factory in the area which allows visitors inside for a tour.,1
1081,That Volunteer took us the the whole tea making process from start to end with quiet a bit of details which were news to us.,1
1082,They have a shop where one can buy all their produce at reasonable prices.,1
1083, they allow you to explore their plantation and if you want can also click some pictures of you with your family that too in tradtional costume wore during cutting tea leaves!,0

1085,Sunvalley management has also kept a local guide book in each rooms for help of visitors.,0
1086,somethings which you wont find on internet at times.,1
1087,So it took us some while after leaving hotel to reach there.,0
1088,We had nice time and manage to finish exploring it just in time to reach Ooty station for catching Toy Train.,1
1089,Sun was about to set so we didnt enjoyed the beautiful views from the train for too long but whatever we could was good enough memory to take back.,0
1090,Two days in Sunvalley went really well and we were really pleased with the kind of stay & service that we got there!,1
1091, as a guest you are allowed to explore it any time.,0
1092,"Unfortunately Sai was not comfortable in the middle and hence we spent very short time there,",1
1093,we have hired their car services only for that.,0
1094,Driver stopped at a roadside hotel which we didnt find good for food.,1
1095,It was around 415 pm when we stopped in front of Jade Garden hotel which we have booked for our stay in Mysore.,1
1096,"No doubt hotel was good from food,",0
1097,facilities perspective but staff was not as people centric as we expected.,1
1098,There was no better shopping oppourtunity than this!,1
1099,Shopping was good and so was time spent.,0
1100,we ordered food in the room which we realised is the best option considering nusance Sai would cause if we have to go down to the Restaurant.,0
1101,we decided to opt for that instead of expensive car hire for next day.,0
1102,Its a grand place and very well maintained too for all these years.,1
1103,They also have battery operated cars for old/kids if anyone wants to hire them to explore the palace.,1
1104,Its the clan of Vodiyaar's who has been ruling as Kings of Mysore till it became part of India during independance.,1
1105, private rooms etc.,1
1106,We have read that Mysore Zoo is one of the best maintained in India so our hopes were elevated.,1
1107,Overall it was nice experience to see all those wonderful animals and in a fairly well maintained zoo!,1
1108,In fact somewhere inbetween guide also shares their disappointment over not getting recognised by Karnataka government but having recognition of Goa administration.,0
1109,In some 20 odd rooms that wax museum mainly showcases musical instruments from many part of the world.,1
1110,First one left us midway citing gas issues and 2nd one charged us little above.,0
1111,But at the end we reached safely back to hotel which was more important.,1
1112,Musical fountains at Vrindavan were main attractions and it starts only around 7 pm so considering time & distance we hired a cab for the day for rent of INR 1000.,1
1113,On the way you have small shops to pick up some local stuff.,0
1114,Temple is old but well maintained and has imprint of Karnataka style architecture.,1
1115,"From there we stopped at Government recognised shop called """"Kavery Emporium"""" in main city.",1
1116,"Every second name of place/shop in Mysore will have """"Kavery"""" in it for obvious reasons that its their main river and which is also in the news over dispute over its water sharing with neighbouring Tamilnadu.",1
1117,Its always better to shop Chandan from Govt shop over anything else.,1
1118,"He also took a halt at locally famous """"Mahalaxmi Sweets"""" shop where we picked up local favourate """"Mysore Pak"""" and some chivda.",1
1119,Can easily accomodate more than 2000 cars i believe.,1

1121,We stayed for some time and then moved on as it was getting dark and it was out in open.,0
1122,Sai as well had a decent time.,0
1123,"After a decent 60-70 mins,",0
1124,Hired Meru at the airport and back we were in our sweet home.,1
1125, safety and comfort over anything else.,1
1126,1) Stay at Sunvalley Homestay - I doubt you will get a better choice in Ooty/Conoor.,1
1127,4) Vrindavan Gardens - It can be better maintained but still has enough charm of its own.,1
1128,10) Shopping in Mysore.,0
1129,"On a quitte Rameswaran en taxi encore car l'horaire du bus ne nous convenait pas (et le prix était très raisonnable,",1

1133,When we got to Chennai it was sooo busy at the station and it was huge so we couldn't find our hotel taxi.,1
1134,Stayed in the hotel most of the time though because going out was a bit of a hassel but the pool was dirty and really small.,1
1135, Inside the hotel itself was really nice though.,0
1136, Tout est facile d'acces a pied.,0
1137, but the volunteers spent much of the day glancing uncomfortably at each other.,0

1175, which was then replaced by the pungent flower garlands hanging from shop canopies.,1
1176,We browsed the stands selling clothes and a few volunteers bought school supplies.,1
1177,After shopping we went to lunch.,0
1178, Some of the volunteers have been here for quite a long time already; they have been craving anything that isn’t curry and rice.,0

1213, Throw in some functioning wifi and we are all set up for a week.,1
1214,For a start there are enough of them to cope with demand so we are not crammed in; they are not so ancient so as to be about to die at any minute; the drivers don't think they should be representing their country at a Grand Prix; and the roads are made of smooth tarmac with upward rising speed humps rather than downward dropping pot holes (sample size = 3 journeys).,1
1215, It is difficult to tell where the town ends and the temple begins as there are streets and shops inside the temple compound.,0
1216,"We didn't plan to stay long in Madurai,",0
1217, so we took a room near to the out-of-town bus station and nipped in to visit the Sri Meenakshi temple on an autorickshaw.,0
1218, Such is its popularity that the queues regularly stretch a couple of hundred metres into the thoroughfare.,0
1219,We experienced the variable climate from a 4th floor room with a balcony overlooking the Cathedral sized church and the sweeping coast receding towards the wind farm and nuclear power plant.,1
1220, but the rest of us couldn't wait to see it.,0
1221, Umila took notes on every shot (216 in total) so that we could organize it into appropriate categories.,1
1222," As I walked past on my way back to the guesthouse where all of the volunteers stay,",0
1223,I am back to my room for a bit before my last class of my first week (although not a whole week).,1
1224, the young ones get ready for bed and a volunteer reads them a bedtime story.,1
1225, they weren’t able to communicate it in an organized and effective way.,1
1226, There are many students and the room is small.,0
1227, No internet in the guesthouse.,0
1228," which hangs in the main room of the school building,",0
1229, it isn’t possible to keep perishable food in the volunteer’s refrigerator.,1
1230," I was fighting to stay awake in our volunteer meeting last night,",1
1231," I so grateful for them—they are a time for volunteers to talk about problems,",1
1232, but at times think I’d be comfortable with a light blanket.,0
1233, It was not even hot enough to make me fully understand that I had come so far.,0
1234, shops with brightly painted gates pulled down in front for the night.,1
1235,My room and roommate are both lovely.,0
1236, The room is comfortable and clean.,0
1237, I feel lucky to be in such a nice room with such an nice person.,0
1238, I guess I will have to wait until tonight.,0
1239, Unser Hotel liegt am Strand von Mahabalipuram.,0
1240," Welch andere Welt in unserem Hotel in Madurai,",0
1241," Wir verbringen den letzten Abend mit unserer Gruppe im gemütlichen Dachgarten eines Hotels im Geschäftsviertel,",0
1242," Wir sind Gott sei Dank ein wenig abseits in einem Hotel mit privatem Strandabschnitt,",0
1243, There was a small platform where all of the volunteers and Miss Beena sat to watch the events.,0
1244,"Except for lighting issues (which are almost a given at SB--our limited electricity leads to a lot of back-up plans),",1
1245," I stayed up """"late"""" with the eleventh and twelfth graders in the school building.",0
1246," I managed to do this last week for the eleventh and twelfth graders,",0
1247,So after we finished our volunteering in the South it was time to get back on the road and head for the mountains.,0
1248,So we have been at the volunteering project now for 2 weeks.,0
1249," obviously there are certain rules of politeness that apply to all peoples,",1
1250, and differences in how queues are handled (I cannot count how many people have budged me in line because I left two feet of space between myself and the person ahead of me).,1
1251," But there were also things that I did not expect: being followed by the hotel owners in Hampi (see """"Humming in Hampi"""" if you have no idea what I'm talking about),",0
1252, the general rule of thumb is: take them off if you see other shoes at the door.,0
1253, it was accepted that one removes one's shoes at the door of any shop or restaurant (as long as the restaurant did not have a dirt floor).,1
1254, and then again when we entered a room with an Egyptian mummy.,1
1255, but the only explanation we could think of for the first gallery was that the room contained several Quarans.,1
1256, I decided to stay at SB and get some mehndi.,0
1257,It is almost a rite of passage for volunteers to have mehndi done for them by the students.,1
1258, to ease application and therefore allow for complex designs.,1
1259," the American volunteers have had a lot of conversations about the gastronomical losses: no turkey,",1
1260," It is far easier to discuss the food that I'm missing than to discuss the overheated kitchen,",1
1261," And food is definitely an easier topic than discussing the laughter,",1
1262," In case I don't say it enough: Friends,",0
1263, and now I eat it comfortably every day.,0
1264, how male friends in India feel comfortable holding hands.,1
1265, I'm lucky enough to have instant access to those I love through the internet.,0
1266, and solar power on the path as I go back to my room every night.,1
1267, I'm lucky to be staying in a place where I can get water through plumbing even in my second-floor room.,0
1268, we took a taxi to Tirupati from Chennai.,0
1269,Distance from Chennai (airport) to Tirupati is 180 km and from Internet we had learned that it will take about 3.,1
1270,(2) Queue for Rs.,0
1271,(3) Queue for Rs.,0
1272, On different days of the week the queue for Rs.,0
1273, Lord Balaji gives you appointment at a fixed hour and you don't have to wait in the queue for more than 3 hours.,1
1274, You can rest in your hotel room and come at the appointed hour.,1
1275,15 in the Vaikuntham Queue Complex.,0
1276, It is a stepped room with metal grill walls on all four sides (hence I prefer to call it cage).,1
1277, We were explained that sometimes it takes more than 24 hours of waiting in free darshan.,0
1278, We were looking for the volunteers to unlock the cage and take us out.,1
1279, We passed through a maze of queue system for next hour.,0
1280, there was another queue system for collecting coupons for 'laddus'.,1
1281, after waiting in the queue for 5 hours.,0
1282,Queues didn't end there.,0
1283,The TTD (Tirupati-Tirumala-Devasthanam) must be given full credit for making all possible efforts to maintain order and provide as much facilities to the visitors as possible.,1
1284, Volunteers were poilte and courteous.,0
1285,Next on the agenda was to search for room to stay at night.,1
1286, All the accommodations are managed by the Temple authority and are booked in advance.,1
1287,We decided to climb down the hill and stay in some hotel at Tirupati (there are many there).,1
1288,So after Alleppey we caught a train to Trivandrum and stayed at the YMCA for a night.,1
1289, We managed to find a hotel that served a cool beer and ended up watching the start of the Diwali festival and fireworks from the rooftop of the hotel (I told Jess the fireworks had been planned in advance for her!,1
1290, facilities for young people with learning and mental difficulties and a 14 acre plot of land used to grow plants and trees for the purpose of organic farming that is shipped out to local farming communities.,1
1291," There was a lot of prep-work: For weeks in advance we (the volunteers and staff) would hold little secret night """"meetings,",1
1292,"volunteer put it,",0
1293, there is never enough love to go around for each individual student.,1
1294," I ended up dancing in the volunteers' rendition of """"Gangnam Style"""" and """"Bare Necessities"""" (which I choreographed),",1
1295, I also acted in a skit where all of the volunteers pretended to be the students and Ms.,0
1296," so I spent time singing in the music room with Vinceya,",1
1297," The first two I managed just fine by myself,",0
1298, but I did not want to because past volunteers have singed their sarees on the firecrackers (not to mention I would have to borrow a saree).,0
1299," what I had was bobby pins and some hair spray some other volunteer left,",0
1300, But Cathy was gracious enough to french braid my hair very nicely and turn a mess into something fancy.,1
1301,"In general I stayed out of the chaos,",0
1302, son and myself) checked in Hotel Vivek where we had booked a room thru net.,1
1303, situated in upper Coonoor near Upasi at Figure of 8 Road and after calling the hotel we could locate the place.,0
1304, There are a few small fruits and vegetables shops and tea stalls located in the junction.,1
1305, There are a number of shops congested in this area.,0
1306, There is one vegetarian hotel Sri Lakshmi near to the bus stand.,0
1307," As we heard about the tasty biscuits available in these bakeries we shopped in the New Indian Bakery,",1
1308," A large number of tiny shops and stalls selling fruits,",1
1309, It was getting very cold and we came back to the hotel for dinner without further wanderings.,1
1310, Interestingly the poojary (performer of rituals) of the temple was a young fellow who had his MBA done and was undergoing management consultancy as told to us.,0
1311," lots of shops displaying paintings,",0
1312," Some stayed below the trees,",0
1313, waiting for customers.,0
1314, we headed over to the Mandir and stayed until lunch.,0

1316, maintained the choir while there was no teacher.,0
1317," so I'm thinking of buying them (with my remaining fundraised-money) """"Carol of the Bells"""" or some other simple Christmas piece with enough copies for each of them to actually see the music.",1
1318,"I was unsurprised but slightly disappointed by the anthology's choice of using this,",1
1319, He can't have been comfortable carrying those round on his head!,0
1320, We entered the station and were shown to the upper class waiting room to use the bathroom if we needed.,1
1321, We walked into the waiting room and the stench of stale urine hit us hard.,0
1322," but this was a tiled room with a tiny little hole in the corner,",0
1323, There was little to no leg room sat down.,0
1324, The hotel seemed ok at first glance.,1
1325, We were told our rooms were not ready and we were to be given one between 14 people to freshen up and leave our bags.,1
1326," The room we were given was to be someone’s room for the night,",0
1327," it had to be the smallest room in the world,",0
1328, Needless to say I couldn't wait to see our room!,0
1329,We all got into taxis for a day tour of Mumbai.,0
1330," correspondence to people including Hitler and Tolstoy and there was a room with different scenes depicting pinnacle points in his life,",1
1331," It is also flanked by a Taj hotel which is a gorgeous,",0
1332,"sellers were just guys mingled in with the crowds and when I pulled out a wad of cash it turned out I had managed to only bring out 10 rupee notes (around 11p a note) this doesn't stretch very far (even in India) We borrowed money from Louise and hopped on a boat just as they decided it full,",1
1333," To Plantys disappointment we had not come to see elephants,",0
1334," This put a member of our group off going any further and Planty gallantly offered to stay in the bar with her,",1
1335,in the sense that you just stand and wonder how on earth people managed to create such impressive structures.,1
1336, We couldn't wait to leave this island and its crazy junk food obsessed animals.,1
1337," We rushed back to the hotel with under an hour to get ready,",1
1338, our taxi driver basically gave us a guided tour of Mumbai which we had already done that day.,1
1339, Our room was actually impressive!,0
1340,The next morning we decided to brave the streets of Mumbai over the hotel “restaurant” for breakfast.,1
1341, We saw the others in a coffee shop and they warned us not to eat anything with cheese in.,0
1342, we knew they hadn’t started our wraps yet and had to get back to the hotel so said we would just buy our drinks and leave.,1
1343, In the taxi the driver asked if we liked music.,0
1344, especially when another taxi nearly crashed trying to overtake.,1
1345," I should have noted Plantys new rule of never order anything green as it turned out to be a sort of salty mango jelly concoction,",1
1346,We got in a taxi with an orange Ganesh and two plastic crocodiles on the dashboard.,1
1347," the “alor resort” was not much of a resort,",0
1348," we were shown to our room which was obviously back out the hotel,",1
1349, The cheap beer continued in the restaurant.,1
1350, I was watching one in the bar toying with two young men and no sooner had I mentioned it she turned her attention to the locals playing pool with Rick and Planty.,1
1351, We made it back to our taxi and told him we'd seen enough of old Goa and to go to the spice farm.,0
1352, He didn't even flinch when four soggy westerners bundled into his taxi and told him to basically skip all of Goa's history and culture and find the elephants.,1
1353, The weather had managed to clear up but down at the beach it became evident it was going to rain again.,1
1354," I tried to argue the ethics of taking an animal out of the gene pool before it has chance to breed,",0
1355, We got a taxi which proved to be the slowest journey ever.,0
1356,The plan for the next day was to check out hire mopeds to check out the other beaches north Goa has to offer.,1
1357,50 for a days hire and set off.,0
1358," I don't think either of us enjoyed the journey back to the hotel and its safe to say mopeds were not my favourite mode of transport whilst in India,",1
1359," We managed to leave the hotel pretty much straight away,",0
1360," we were reliant on Shaz one last time to sort our taxi and we parted with him telling us if we need anything whilst in India or if we ever return to not hesitate to call,",0
1361, We had debated whether to keep our booking for the south Goan hotel as we only had one night there and were leaving early next morning.,1
1362," if we hadn't had the worlds slowest taxi driver and got lost the journey would have been minimal,",1
1363, The hotel was beautiful!,0
1364, We dragged ourselves out of our luxurious room and down a palm tree lined path to the beach.,1
1365, All for the price of a beer which is cheap anyway!,1
1366, Back at the hotel there was time for a quick dip in the pool before dinner.,0
1367, Our hotel arranged a taxi and we made it to the airport in around 30 mins.,0
1368, especially when you have leg room fit for a toddler!,1
1369,we decided on another prepaid government taxi service from the airport and for £3.,1
1370, Every surface in the cab in fact was floral!,0
1371," The guy who's job it was to allocate taxis pestered for a tip,",1
1372, because we found him rude bur then ensured we tipped our taxi driver double (the look on his face said he knew our game) our arrival at the hotel was bizarre.,1
1373," We had booked five star because it was cheap and I thought it would be good to go from Dubai to basic backpacker accommodation to luxury,",0
1374, Before our taxi entered the premises a guard had a metal detector in the boot.,1
1375, We got to our room and to be honest we saw as much of Chennai as we did of Delhi!,1
1376," I was slightly disappointed with Chennai if i'm honest,",1
1377, being the business centre and full of swanky hotels I expected more.,1
1378, Afterwards we went into the hotel bar and had a beer.,1
1379, Our hotel said bye with a complimentary box of south Indian sweets (an acquired taste).,1
1380," We had tried to book a taxi again but failed,",0
1381, i'm sure Planty will go into the colourful detail so ended up travelling to the airport in a hotel car with “accord metropolitan” splashed up the side.,1
1382, India took us out of our comfort zones and really showed what we are capable of.,0
1383, I don't ever think my comfort zone will shrink back to what it was and I think I’ve learnt a lot about valuing experiences over possessions.,0
1384," and headed across to our platform to wait for the train,",0
1385," I waited and made sure all the girls where on before I climbed aboard (because I'm a true gentleman),",1
1386, and observed our surroundings for what would be our new hotel for the night.,1
1387," but our guide told us to stay in our seats,",0
1388, the more chance there is of us using their hotel/restaurant/tuk tuk etc.,1
1389, He soon managed to find it when I shouted him to “TURN THAT F*****G ALARM OFF!,0
1390," we got a bunch of taxi's to the hotel,",1
1391, leaving us all sweating our arse's off in the taxi wanting to gently remove every extremity from his body.,1
1392," and sweaty taxi journey,",0
1393, but our rooms weren’t ready yet.,0
1394," There was only one room ready,",0
1395," Some of the information and the things that he said were really interesting,",0
1396, and I was quite disappointed when I found out there are no elephants on there.,0
1397," While we waited for our tickets,",0
1398," As we waited for the boat the same lad casually walked over and hurled some abuse at me in Hindi,",0
1399," I said I'd stay back with her to keep her company,",1

1408," We got into a taxi and headed for the airport,",0
1409," Staying true to the stereotypical view of westerners,",1
1410," we headed outside to be greeted by our already waiting taxi's,",1
1411,We arrived after an hour drive through the tropical climate of Goa and arrived at our hotel and checked in.,1
1412," We were shown to our room which was out of the hotel,",1
1413," We waited a while for our food,",0
1414," but I don't mind waiting for food,",0
1415," the resort was hit by a monsoon,",0
1416," we waited for the rain to stop as we paid our bills,",1
1417," while the bar staff came over with free shots for us (which were the size of a triple shot back in the UK) we were informed that 330ml bottles of kingfisher were on offer at 2-4-1,",1
1418," Just before I had decided that I'd had enough showers for the day,",1
1419, and we made our way inside to wait for our tour of the farms.,0
1420," As we waited for the buffet to be prepared,",0
1421," allowing us to climb on top of her,",1
1422, We sat just behind the elephants head and waited as the owner gave a command.,1
1423," enough of that soppy crap,",0
1424," we headed for a shop to buy some beer,",0
1425," we analysed the menu while gulping down the very cold and very cheap beer,",1
1426," feeling a bit disappointed and also trusting him,",0
1427,"While we waited for our food,",0
1428," but I managed to pull off a speech that seemed to impress my fellow travellers,",1
1429," me and Rick stayed outside for a short while when Shaz highlighted how we'd made the trip so much fun for him,",1
1430," me and Lotty only stayed for one because I felt pretty rough,",0

1436, who told us that he'd sort out a taxi for us to take us to south Goa.,0
1437," The hotel was amazing,",0
1438,"that we had stayed in over the last 15 days,",0
1439," As we only had the one night in the hotel (due to our original direct flight from Goa to Sri Lanka being cancelled) we decided to make the most of our time there,",0
1440," and enjoyed a quick dip in the hotel pool,",0

1466, I like this guy because his information and knowledge are quite authentic which is missing amongst most of my office colleagues.,1
1467,It was very interesting information indeed.,0
1468, I waited for more than 45 minutes.,0
1469,out of the bus stand and found a couple of taxis were parked outside.,0
1470," The rooms on the southern side remain in good condition,",0
1471, but the rooms on the western and northern sides have been substantially damaged.,0

1480, It's a panic attack waiting to happen.,1
1481," and we bought several very cheap kurtas (tunics,",1
1482, and other volunteers who have been here longer said it has been a while.,0
1483," But the temperature is comfortable day and night,",0
1484,"or so cabbies waiting for jet-lagged customers,",0
1485," but I made it safely to Shanti Bhavan and was immediately swept up to my room where my roommate,",1
1486, Ally and I (and possibly other volunteers) are planning on going to Hosur this weekend.,0
1487, And I was anxiously waiting for Mandapam station to come so that I can see the longest railway bridge.,0
1488, As soon as we came out of our AC coach the hot and sunny weather has welcomed us at the Rameswaram.,1
1489, We did not have idea of how much Auto person will charge but knows that Station and temple is not too far (Approx.,1
1490, As we were new the Auto person charged us Rs 60/-As regards to accommodation we were advised by my uncle to visit a Dharamshala which was close to East gate of the temple and has a very good view of sea (See Pic 2).,1
1491, So we preferred to go directly to that Dharamshala and luckily we got the room at second floor.,1
1492, This dharamshala is managed by Bajarang das bapa seva trust (Phone no.,1
1493, There are 16 rooms in that Dharamshala and most of the time it is occupied by a group booking.,0
1494, The room was ok ok not so good in terms of housekeeping or maintenance but what good was in the room was clean Toilet and bathroom and clean bedsheets and Pillowcover.,1
1495, I think they allot the rooms to the family or to the group and not to the individual (Jyada log to room milne ke chances jyada).,1
1496, As soon as we have completed our registration formalities the Dharamshala staff has offered us to take Lunch which was going on and was I think is included in the room cost.,0
1497,There was a big dinning room at the ground floor of the building and food was served on a Pangat basis (Sitting on a floor in a row).,1
1498,"We had asked the dharamshala staff and they said no rules and regulation regarding clothes ,",1
1499, but wear which is comfortable as you have to take bath in sea and then walk down to temple to take holy bath at 22 Kunds.,1
1500," Also you are not allowed to go inside the temple with wet clothes for Darshan so either you can carry clothes for changing or come back to dharamshala,",1
1501, So we went to sea (Also known as Agnee Teertham) which was very close to our room at 1445 hrs.,1
1502,But There were very few people who were buying this tickets as there were many in between guides who were charging Rs 50/- per person to take you around all the Kunds and their attender will pour water on you.,0
1503, So for 3 person we paid Rs 225/- ( No charges taken for my 04 year kid) to this guide for Kund holy bath.,1
1504, one we can go back to our room and change the clothes and then come for Darshan and second we can change the clothes at the temple itself and do the Darshan.,1
1505,After Darshan we returned to our room and planned to go around the temple.,1
1506, One important thing is that there are number of Lodges and Dharamshala at East and South side.,0
1507,I am just writing down few dharamshalas and lodges phone numbers from where I had collected their cards.,1
1508,As when I was researching on Accommodation part I was not getting any dharamshala and lodges phone number on the internet with very economical charges and we went without booking any room inadvance which could be quite risky when you are going with old people and kids.,1
1509," There are many other lodges like Sahukar wala bhawan ,",0
1510, One thing one should note that in general case I do not think there will be any problem as regards to room and food near temple.,1
1511, And it is advisable to take room either on East side or on South side.,0
1512,After standing in a queue for almost 15-20 minutes the queue started moving .,0

1662, There is little to do in Pondicherry but it is a pleasant enough place to wander for a few hours.,0
