0, I would step into the noisy world outside and walk a short ways up the street.,0
1,"I threw my arms up to the heavens and cried out,",0
2, and cleaned and sutured the wound.,0
3, I was bit worried because my friends said that there will be heavy crowd because of the festival time but surprisingly very less number of people were there and peacefully we had our darshan.,1
4, They have set up a viewing platform on the roof of the shop to overlook the temple and act as a draw card for prospective clients.,1
5,"The trip down the beach turned out to be a trip down the new,",0
6,"A trip with the promise of a views of a beautiful hill station,",1
7,very close to the Botanical Gardens near the heart of the city and Hotel Lake View for the last day.,1
8, The traffic near the city reminded me of the crazy Bangalore traffic but it eased off as we moved out of the city.,1
9, The lake was about 30 km from the city and on the way I was able to city the Emerald lake which looked supremely scenic with the surrounding greenery.,0
10,The Avalanche lake can only be viewed when you book a safari which is run by the forest department.,1
11, The safari's first highlight was the Cauliflower Shola which gets its name as the canopy of trees on the hills when viewed from a view point resemble a cauliflower.,1
12, And finally to top the views came the Avalanche lake.,1
13, Doddabetta turned out to be a dampener after all the hype as it was overcrowded though it had some good scenic views.,0
14, The surrounding is very peaceful without the din of the city.,1
15, The photos speak for themselves in this case ? Dolphin's Nose and Lamb's rock are both view points offering differing scenic views of Ooty.,1
16, Lamb's rock had a view of green hills forming a V boundary to the city with cloud patterns at the top in the blue sky.,1
17," At Dolphin's Nose view point,",0
18, The route was easily one of the most beautiful routes I have been on.,1
19, Then it led to a forest like path for about a km which opened to lush green pastures and provided a view that was breathtaking.,1
20, Post the view was a climb through a dense region for about a km which was breath-taking.,1
21, I started off to Needlerock View Point at Gudalur in The Nilgiris.,0
22, It was a short walk to the top and the overall 360 degree view was amazing from the top.,1
23, From there I moved on to Pykara Waterfalls which was about 20 Kms from Needlerock View Point.,0
24, the waterfall was not something spectacular though it was pretty well maintained and scenic.,1
25, I still had time and thus on the way back decided to head to the super crowded botanical garden.,1
26, it was decorated beautifully though there wasn't much space to move around.,1
27," After viewing all the decorations which included trains,",1
28,I returned to check into Lake View Hotel.,0
29, Hotel Lake View was definitely a very well located and maintained restaurant.,1
30, As the run is untimed you can take as long as you want enjoying the amazing scenic routes throughout the run without worrying about the competition.,0
31,The peaceful environment with the small crowds compared to the hustle and bustle of the city or the throng of people in a city is certainly refreshing.,1
32, Ooty is undoubtedly blessed with natural beauty with stunning views though the timing might probably be better after the monsoons probably during Aug-Sept-Oct.,1
33, or hang strands from their rear view mirrors in their vehicles.,1

331, to relax and read our books for the afternoon.,1
332," and there are traffic lights,",0
333, and traffic continues to flow in at least two of three directions at all times.,1
334, until we spot a traffic policeman loitering nearby.,1
335," while the rest of the traffic continues unabated,",1
336, There are allegedly spectacular views over Chennai.,1
337, Problem 1: there is a heat haze/pollution so not much is visible.,0
338,all of Ren’s photos on her camera after she showed him a photo of the beach where I’d picked up my necklace/bracelets – they liked them and wanted to know what I paid for them.,1
339, I don’t remember walking – we were just jammed into a mass of bodies that carried us along with them.,0
340," There was something very calm and inclusive about the atmosphere inside,",1
341, our views on India and life in general.,0
342, and then visibly relaxed when I changed the subject.,0
343, and I showed them my photos of the beach at Mamallapuram because some of them hadn’t been to that part of India.,1
344, but I came very close when we stepped into the streaming crowd at this station.,1
345, you just got pushed forward by the momentum of the crowd until you were deposited outside the station.,1
346, the distinctive brightly-coloured gopuram (gatehouse tower) and outer temple walls came into view at the end of the street.,1
347,) to be walking along an Indian road without fear of being deafened by horns or knocked over by a speeding motorbike.,0
348, I say ‘sadly’ because it was a beautiful temple and I would have loved to have some photographs to make sense of all the fast moving colour and movement we witnessed.,0
349,The Sri Meenakshi Temple is considered to be the most beautiful temple in South India.,1
350, very crowded with both local worshippers and pilgrims who had travelled from all over India.,0
351, remembering that he had told me this was one of the most beautiful temples he had seen.,1
352, and the praying and chanting crowd was pressing in on them.,0
353," Andrew and Brian bore the brunt of my weight as the crowd fell into me,",1
354, but I can see how easily a stampede could have occurred in such an enclosed place when crowd numbers aren’t controlled.,0
355," more poverty and beggars than we’d seen in the other towns and cities,",0
356, I was amazed by the starkness of the beach and surrounds.,1
357," The chaotic traffic and masses of people made it impossible to ride more than 50 metres without stopping to avoid cars,",1
358," I loved the relaxed family atmosphere at the Five Rathas and Krishna’s Butterball,",1
359," We made our way up some narrow stairs to the atmospheric Santana Beach Restaurant,",1
360, We had to disregard the state of the beach and turn a blind eye to the bloated cat that had washed up just in front of us.,1
361, As we walked back along the beach I picked up a necklace and a few bracelets from a beach seller – I wanted something to remember my first Indian surf experience!,1
362, so we welcomed the chance to relax and cool down.,1
363,We drove along the foreshore where a sea-misty Indian Ocean was the background for a popular but drab beach front area.,1
364," We were surrounded by beautiful trees which unfortunately supplied a brilliant environment for mosquitoes,",1
365,"especially in traffic with trucks,",0
366, I found negotiating the streams of traffic a challenge.,0
367,Next we braved more crowds through another market area and congested roads to a massive open air bas-relief wall frieze known as Arjuna’s Penance (or Descent of the Ganges).,1
368, it would have been nice to have had a longer bike ride – perhaps on the network of quiet back streets that radiated off the main drag (rather than on the main road itself).,0
369,"Andrew and I don't like crowds much,",0
370,We walked to Santana Restaurant on the beach for lunch.,0
371," we had a good view of the beach below us,",0
372,"The beach wasn’t really set up for lounging about,",0
373, so after lunch we found a space on the far end of the beach that wasn't occupied by cows or groups of young guys.,1
374," There were the usual shops selling beach sarongs and trinkets,",0
375," The traffic had subsided,",0
376,"We had a short photo stop at the Bison Valley viewing point before continuing on to Jungle Retreat,",1
377, sipped cold beer and took in the stunning view of Mt Nilgiri towering above us.,1
378, and it provided a stunning 360 degree view around the local villages.,1
379," The view from the top of the hill was incredible,",1
380, especially the breathtaking view of Mt Nilgiri in the early morning sun.,1
381," We walked past people cleaning the streets,",0
382," The good news was that the views were spectacular,",0
383, we stopped at a lookout point for beautiful views of the valleys and mountains surrounding us.,1
384, with the mountains framing the picture.,0
385, so it was a case of being very quiet while we showered and got ready for bed - a bit hard to do when you've got the giggles.,1
386, On the way I looked back towards the Retreat and the mist clad peaks of the mountain range behind it were just starting to glisten with the first rays of the sun.,1
387," We made good time walking across fields and across villages,",0
388,"At the top of the hill the view was fabulous,",1
389,"The setting and quiet beauty of the Jungle Retreat was fantastic,",1
390, the relaxing atmosphere of sitting around the pool and the family dogs and cats!,1
391, and I began to drift in and out of sleep and in and out of the numerous conversations of people around me until all I could hear was the distant white noise of voices.,1
392," We were in a noisy rest stop on the side of a busy road,",0
393," We were crossing together and the majority of traffic had stopped,",0
394, The traffic madness began to subside and less and less people lined the roadside.,1
395," Mountains loomed in front of us,",0
396, and I began to wish I was still on the morning train (train travel is far more comfortable than sitting in a minibus climbing a mountain road).,1
397, We had another two hours of this spectacular (and at times terrifying) ascent into the greenery of Tamil Nadu’s higher plateau.,1
398," The traffic build up was incredible,",0
399,"30pm for our scenic trip back to Ooty,",0
400, Ootacamund or Ooty is one of the three hill stations in the Nilgiri ranges (Blue Mountains) and has much colder weather.,1
401, It was comfortable and clean-ish.,0
402," The view was stunning,",0
403, overtaking trucks and jeeps on blind corners at every opportunity with an ever-present soundtrack of honking of horns.,0
404,The trip was supposed to take three hours but took a bit longer due to the traffic we encountered when we had to stop for a wild elephant on the road.,1
405, The poor elephant had probably been trying to cross the hilly road but couldn't due to the constant stream of traffic in both directions.,0
406," there were spectacular looking tea plantations that dotted the surrounding hills,",1
407, but it looked more densely populated than Ooty.,0
408, There were stunning views of the lush green valley spread around us.,1
409, and in hesitant English one of the guys suggested that we should definitely visit Hyderabad because it was beautiful and hot – 'no cold cold like this'.,1
410," This line is part of the Nilgiri Mountain Railway,",1
411,forests and winding tunnels cut into the beautiful mountain side.,0
412," It would be very fair to call it a beautiful garden/park,",0
413, winding mountainous roads.,0
414," it is the 4th most populous city in India,",1
415, so we had the chance to enjoy some of the scenic views on the trip the previous day.,1
416," After a relaxing afternoon at this park we took the bus back to Chennai,",0
417, mainly saying that the beach was always crowded and dirty.,0
418, I have been to much dirtier beaches around the world.,0
419, so from Marina beach we went back to our hotel.,1
420," Really beautiful place,",0
421, commonly called ECR road from Chennai to Pondicherry is a scenic highway.,0
422,Our first stop was the famous golden beach park.,1
423, On one side the never ending sea “Bay of Bengal” and on the other side the beautiful coconut trees standing in rows.,1
424, The panoramic view makes the journey worthwhile.,1
425,"There were fields where salt is separated,",0
426,Visit to puducherry is incomplete without a walk along beach road .,0
427,Most of the beaches is a little away from the town except for small stretch of sand on Goubert Avenue.,1
428,5 km long walkway running along the beach is the delight of puducherry.,1
429,Lastly we sat at the rocky beach with fruit salad in our hand relaxing; the cool splatter of sea water hitting our face every time the huge waves collides the rocks.,1
430,"Mamallapuram Beach and Temple,",1
431," along a cow-strewn East Coast road we arrived in the beach resort of Mamallapuram where we gathered ourselves,",1
432,PS our bells and horn are invaluable in Indian traffic and the Kindle and selfie stick are getting plenty of abuse.,1
433, The sight of villagers with their towels wrapped around their heads in an effort to save themselves from the hot coastal sun reminded me that the bus is air-conditioned and what looks beautiful to me from my comfortable seat has a very different reality.,1
434, small towns and luxury beach resorts (I guess it is too tempting to leave such a locale unexploited for commercial ventures.,1
435, The Mother believed that the city would be a place where people from all over the world can come together to live in peace and unity.,1
436,"""""Auroville is meant to be a universal town where men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony,",1
437, The center known as Peace Area also has an open air-auditorium and a lake.,1
438," The quiet all around me,",0
439," broken only by a bird’s call or noise from an occasional human activity,",0
440, The immensity of the structure and the sprawling gardens and peace of the place made a deeper impact on me than the Inner Chamber.,1
441, The petal contained a meditation room (air-conditioned with the same dreamy ambience as the inner chamber).,1
442, On reaching the Visitor’s center we learnt that the bus would not be in for another 90 mins and we decided to take an auto-rickshaw (Tuktuk for Laurent) to the Auroville beach on the other side of the East Coast road and then head to Pondicherry from there.,1
443, The beach was a disappointment.,0
444, being an Indian and having brought a foreigner with me I wanted to leave the dirty beach and dirtier road to it as soon as possible.,0
445, However I was comforted when he remarked that he was amazed how clean the white shirts and the white dhotis of the local people given that they seemed to travel and live in such conditions.,1
446, I had never seen these beautiful creatures before and was excited.,1
447," The beach next to the restaurant where small boys were trying to surf in a small area,",0
448, Built in Gothic style and the red and white church looks beautiful from the inside ( The Sacred Heart Church near Egmore in Chennai was quite a disappointment and I was thought that Pondicherry might also be the same).,1
449, The “beggar” was a properly dressed fellow with no signs of poverty.,0
450, made a beggar of him and robbed him of his sense of self-respect.,1
451," The “beggar” apparently spoke fluent French,",0
452, But I also warned him that Kolkata would also be crowded and hot.,1
453, (He has since decided on Kerela as he said that the heat and crowd would be too much for him!,0
454, there was chaos and for people who did not have their own transport it was like dealing with a bunch of pimps.,1
455, I knew I would miss the peace and quiet of Pondicherry in general and Auroville in particular.,0
456, I think I understand the idea behind Auroville and all such places which are meant for quiet contemplation better now.,1
457,"In the peaceful atmosphere,",0
458, the trip brought into sharp focus the need to reduce the noise in my head and re-visualize the possibilities with my own self.,1
459,- view from our 'drumstick' or Tamarind tree.,0
460," It's nice not to be honked at so much,",0
461," even if the honking is meant as a nicety,",0
462," We discussed traffic here in the south as compared to the north,",0
463,"We continue to visit the beach often and have discovered a much nicer,",1
464," They are gorgeous hand carved/crafted works of art in many cases,",1
465,but decided that the beach was much more fun.,0
466," art and relaxing together at Arka,",1
467, The new place is beautiful and I am free of feeling unwelcome due to the disquietude that Malek and Sephina produced in such an otherwise serene environment.,1
468," Though I've recently really enjoyed the days of walking 3km with Sephina on my back to Auro Beach and around town,",1
469, In the past five days we've ventured to the beach 4 times.,1
470," which is said to be 'the' or one of the nicest beaches in India,",0
471," reminds me of Long Beach in CA,",1
472, pre-beach clean up minus seagulls and seaweed.,1
473," It's littered in trash (as are the roads in general,",0
474, just got back from the beach again and enjoyed swimming somewhat far out with Sephina and Malek both.,0
475, It's happened several times at the beach where a group of twenty something men will come over and ask to have their picture taken with just Sephina.,1
476, The road from Mysore onward is a 2 lane one but is flanked by endless sunflower fields on both sides for a long stretch making a wonderful sight.,1
477, This too had extremely scenic views to offer.,0
478, We could see clouds descending down on the mountains and turning into droplets of rain.,0
479, The chaotic dance of Indian traffic fascinated the kids and I and reminded me of the many months I’d spent years ago in China.,1
480, He is uncertain of his surroundings and is feeling insecure and has voiced that this is especially obvious when we are in our room with quiet time.,0
481," (I’m having a hard time warding off mosquitos) other small injuries and mostly homesickness,",0
482, My housemates were able to chase them off with a stick but not before the monkeys had spilt samba all over their clean washing.,1
483,Two weeks have passed since my last blog and I have spent my time travelling between my two placements - Alangayam in the mountains with a few stalls and a small bus station and Vellore City where I have a choice of restaurants and a supermarket just 5 minutes away!,1
484, The message of Vector Borne diseases and eliminating breeding grounds for mosquitoes by using stagnant water and recycling empty containers which might hold drops of water will hopefully be disseminated amongst the villagers.,1
485, We drove into the mountains in the 'party bus' which took about two hours as we had to stop at two check points.,1
486," The road through the mountains was a tad terrifying,",0
487," After much deliberation we started an hour and a half trek through the mountains which led us through a tea plantation where a few of us had a go at harvesting the tea,",1
488," We continued on the walk through the mountain where a few members of the group found leeches attached to their legs,",1
489, After a five minute rest we started our trek to a waterfall which took about an hour.,1
490, On our way to the waterfall we passed some epic scenery and crossed small rushing rivers.,1
491, When we got to the waterfall the majority of us jumped in and started splashing around with an Indian family that was already there and used it as an opportunity to use the water for a much needed shower.,1
492, After about half an hour we got out of the water and started the trek back when the heavens opened and drenched us even more.,1
493, Over the ridge of another mountain peak you could hear the thunder.,1
494,Ivor has taken on the role of Official Restaurant Critic and is far from reticent at airing his views on sloppy service.,1
495, This has kept both him and Archie in Oreos and Mountain Dew.,0
496, Hope everyone's having a nice time in England and relaxing whilst we're here working.,0
497, It was beautiful yet eerie.,0
498," Right now we are all relaxing playing cards and reflecting on how lucky we are at home,",1
499, It is lovely being surrounded by mountains and we are lucky in that it is a few degrees cooler here than in was in Chennai which definitely makes a difference for having a good night's sleep.,1
500, This is a fantastic example of how communities can use up stagnant water safely to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes and Vector Borne Diseases as well as create a source of food for the family.,1
501, Women workers in the fields only earn 100 rupees a day for 6 hours work 6 days a week so extra food would be welcome.,1
502, Hers were beautiful silk but we went for cheap and cheerful as it might be the one and only time we get to wear them.,0
503," the traffic started getting little thinner as we zipped down the East Coast Road to reach Mamallapuram (erstwhile Mahaballipuam),",0
504,beach with the sea merely a few steps away from its boundary wall.,1
505, though it was very clean and functional.,0
506," We walked out into the beach…adjoining the boundary wall of our hotel,",1
507," on one corner of the beach stands Masilamani Nathar temple built in 1305 AD,",0
508, The short strip of beach below the fort's rampart had many fiberglass fishing boats perched on it.,0
509, Explaining the view at Coaker's Walk in words is just not possible you have to experience it.,1
510,"I spend most of the day there itself as it was the best panoramic view of plains with massive lake,",1
511,The commercialization hasn’t destroyed the beauty of the place as it has happened to all the hill station in north.,0
512, The compartment was heavily crowded there was no place to stand and then every now and then vendor s was passing by and the only way out was to move clockwise on your axis so that they can pass.,1
513,Took bus to alangayam it was heavily crowded it took us half an hour to reach alangayam.,1
514,This place was good for taking snap as the bus moved on the kavalur the road was covered with gulmohar trees who were on full blooms the field were green and orchard were laden with ripened mango.,1
515," Jamuna mattur is a beautiful village and suddenly everybody was kind enough to pose for my camera right from elderly ladies who threw their sickles on ground and tucked their sarees ,",0
516, The road is pretty much navigable and there were no traffic issues.,1
517,There was a big crowd having fun in the small water pool they were jumping into the small pool from rock and tree which I think was not safe though I didn’t see anybody getting hurt.,1
518, The place was littered with water bottle and plastic and was stinking as well.,0
519, It was calm and quiet and we could clearly hear some buzzing sounds created by local insects.,1
520, traffic and lifeless concrete was irritating but alas !,0
521, scooped me up in a taxi from the tiny Coimbatore airport and we were immediately on our way for a weekend trip to the Nilgiris mountain town of Ooty.,0
522, Quickly the bland urban colors and stale dry heat were replaced by lush greenery and cooler mountain air as we ascended to over 2200 meters on narrow switchback roads.,1
523," we were witness to was a bustling few intersections of crazy traffic and sidewalks of alternating restaurants and stores,",1
524," The first half of the hike winded through tea patches and the top portion of the mountain took us through eucalyptus forests,",1
525, eventually emerging at a cleared plateau with a small shrine and views of the surrounding valleys and mountains.,1
526," gave emphasis to the depths of the mountains we stared at,",1
527,We walked the narrow road on the side of a mountain which winded its way through the “Ooty suburbs” consisting of small houses along the hill side forests and beautiful tea fields.,1
528,"to the cricket field across the street,",1
529, where I dazzled the crowd with my bowling and batting skills.,1
530, We made a few stops at crowded view points and with each stop we were swarmed by Indian tourists who perhaps were unaccustomed to seeing white people.,0
531, complete with traffic and small towns along the way for its majority.,0
532, the tigers and leopards of the area are attracted to the constantly honking traffic!,1
533, granted there was still a significant amount of through traffic and plenty of honking.,0
534,"tigers populating the 320 square kilometer reserve,",1
535," I spent a half day visiting a beautiful Hindu temple called Marudamalai,",1
536,"I felt like a peaceful island,",0
537," watching my mother as she picked up a pink crab on the beach thinking it to be a shell and as she jumped a foot off the ground when it nudged her hand asking to be put back on the sand,",1
538, Clusters of school children crowded the rocks.,0
539, I placed my head on the Samadhi with yellow roses laid out on it and while it was peaceful I didn’t experience that intense joy I had felt the first time.,1
540, The brick buildings were beautiful and a huge chime called Swaram made music.,0
541, We watched the short film on Auroville and got a viewing pass to the Mandir.,0
542, The viewing platform is a good km from the center.,0
543, the crowd was ferried in vans and we were led by a resident to the gardens surrounding the Mandir.,1
544, which was incredibly beautiful and the experience surreal.,0
545,"Total relaxation days,",0
546, Not relaxing in the slightest!,0
547,So this relaxation massage went along the same lines.,0
548, After which I was free to go supposedly more relaxed and with cleaner sinuses!,1
549,"Up early and took a quick drive through beautiful countryside to the Edakkal Caves,",1
550, we had to walk up a steep mountain and then climb hundreds of steps to get there!,1
551, but the views and the caves were spectacular.,1
552, We then drove to a beautiful village to see the construction of a sustainable community before witnessing a new born calf tottering around.,1
553, on route we stopped off at a peaceful and beautiful tea plantation.,1
554,In the end we left the elephants in peace and found a leopard.,1
555,it is a beautiful place unfortunately I cannot show any photos of the inside as no photos allowed but got a few from outside.,0
556," Friday was cleaning day,",1
557, a temple built on top of a rock 273ft high - the view from the temple over the flat city was amazing!,1
558, It's a quiet space where each person in the circle has an opportunity to share how they are feeling or issues on their mind.,0
559, because everybody has what Shami called a “beautiful dream”.,0
560,This week my weekly second Seva is toilet cleaning – I'm interested in learning more about how they maintain the compost loos.,1
561," Each day after breakfast I clean 6 toilets,",0
562, noises that don't make sense in your own language.,0
563, but what I do remember is the beauty of the landscape that was described.,0
564, many hairspins with amazing views over the Nilgiri Mountains.,1
565, We choose the Mount View Hotel which was ok.,0
566, It looks more like a farming field than a racecourse.,1
567, we could enjoy peacefully a nice cold Kingfisher.,1
568, really beautiful and it would have been worth hanging around in one of the villages.,0
569, but it is a peaceful and pleasant way to experience the landscape.,1
570, organized and clean town.,0
571,After some action packed days it was time for some beach hours.,0
572, pillow and mosquito net.,0
573, dropping leaf litter and providing shade.,0
574,"cooking and cleaning jobs,",1
575," My bike got a puncture at the beach and there was nowhere nearby to get it fixed,",0
576, Eventually we arrived at the beach which was not in the direction we thought we were going at all but it was lovely and with a warm breeze blowing so very comfortable.,1
577, Once the doors were opened and we were ushered into a beautiful restaurant that really transported one to somewhere else.,0
578, seats for express trains in two different categories and then unreserved 2ndclass with wooden or plastic seats crowded with a gazillion people but very cheap.,0
579, We got some advice where to stand which was wrong and so ended up on the wrong end of the platform and then got some great help and we had a mad scramble back up the platform through the crowds to the other end of the platform.,0
580, With all the chaos there is also incredible management.,0
581," New clean linen arrived for us and the old ones taken away,",1
582, Vijawarda station was clean and our hotel was just around the corner.,0
583," It was lovely the view was great and the scenery before us was very pleasant with many hills,",1
584, But this station was incredibly clean – as soon as a train had departed railway staff were on the tracks picking up what they could recycle and then hosing down the tracks as even though on the train it says don’t use the toilets when at a station many people simply don’t care.,1
585,"We arrived latish in the afternoon to normal chaos which I cant find the words to describe- people everywhere feels like millions of them,",1
586,We got a pre-paid rickshaw to our hotel the Ramada on Egmore and it turned out to be a great big room views not incredible more like we can see a glimpse of the city.,1
587, We were excited to come across several teams who were vaccinating children against polio - part of the campaign that has achieved a polio-free status for this populous country.,1
588,This was truly one of the most spectacular religious monuments we have seen - anywhere.,1
589, The view was spectacular though the haze made photography difficult.,1
590,the Ooty Botanical Gardens which were set up in 1847 and had a very relaxed wander.,1
591, Chennai is a major military post and so beggars and dozens of fit young soldiers mixed.,0
592, The beach was wide and dotted with small fishing boats.,0
593,We were heading south along wide boulevards and toll ways to the beach resort of Mamllapuram which is part of a playground for rich Chennai-ans.,1
594," A local guide gave us some pointers on avoiding the traffic but the bigger challenge was the old-style and low mounted handle bars that work to restrict your knees,",0
595, More noise than damage and a whole lot of head waggling seemed to convey blame and contrition at the same time.,0
596, Cath and I went down to the beach for a swim at about 1530.,0
597, The beach was lined with fishing skiffs - half and full sized.,1
598, The half boats were a buoyant wood and only used in very calm weather.,1
599, The water was clean and a refreshing temperature.,1
600,Right on the beach front.,0
601, The room was well set up and the facilities clean and functional.,1
602, there was a cacophony of sleeping sounds during the otherwise peaceful night.,0
603,Onto the bus again for a somewhat hair-raising climb up the mountain roads towards the hill station Coonoor.,1
604, Beautifully cool and less humid up on the plateau.,1
605, which had a spectacular view to the east down the valley to the plains below.,1
606,We enjoyed a beautiful sunrise from the balcony of our room.,0
607," One of those where one is looking down on the mist and smog of the villages down below,",1
608," A simple and clean operation that harvests,",1
609," From there to some way down the mountain to Mettupalayam,",0
610, one of the stations for the Nilgiri Mountain Railway - otherwise known as the toy train.,1
611, The place was really fantastic to watch the beautiful sceneries around.,1
612, Boating as such was not so special as we had done two boating sessions (Paradise beach and Ousteri lake) during previous two days.,1
613, But the mangrove views were interesting.,1
614, Those are very beautiful photographic points.,0
615, Now the northern side beach is used for fishing and is known as fishing beach.,0
616,The sea beach is very close and visible from the temple.,1
617,Although the beach is visible from the temple you cannot go to the water from the temple because of the wall in between.,0
618,You may like to view my video on the shore temple and sea shore in youtube below.,1
619,(The statue man in Golden Beach)Subsequently when I visited the place I did not find any substantial improvement.,1
620, While the cement boat was very much a part of the golden beach now it has been separated and the security guard did not allow us to go towards that side.,1
621, You may like to watch my video of the golden beach in youtube.,1
622, I was very impressed with its beautiful Gopuram and spacious courtyards in the premises.,1
623," The views of the Gopurams were covered by recently constructed buildings,",1
624, I was very disappointed and thought probably I won't see those beautiful views again.,0
625, It is the peaceful land of Lord Nataraj or Chidambaram.,1
626,There are four beautiful Gopuram (entrance) at the four sides of the temple.,1
627, The views of the Gopuram can be described only through the pictures.,1
628,The temple tank is one of the most beautiful places inside the premises.,1
629, one of the finest place to experience the peace of spirituality.,1
630, The beauty of the pillars and their reflections in the water cannot be described in words.,1
631, I at least wanted to stick my toes in the waters of the Bengal Sea so we headed down to the beach and started walking towards the Shore Temple.,1
