306, During our training in the UK we were told that it would be hard to see the development impact we had made in such a short space of time but personally we would notice our own development and I can certainly see this within my teams.,0
307," Everyone's personal journey is different but hopefully there will be many positives,",1
308," The road through the mountains was a tad terrifying,",0
309, The plane journeys went like clockwork however after arriving in Trivandrum we ended up waiting at the airport for another 4 hours waiting for the coach which did eventually turn up…9 hours later…when we had already left.,1
310, While we had a few Tamil lessons during training I have only managed to master a few basic words and sentences and being understood is a real effort.,0
311,After just over two weeks training in Chennai we moved to our placement districts to begin the real work.,1
312, If we run out of water we can go to the end of the road and get some more from the local well.,0
313,For 10 days we lived with a host family in a smaller village in Vallipattu about a 45 min bus journey from Alangayam and about 30 mins from Nimmiyampattu where we go to work in the Youth Resource Centre.,0
314," the traffic started getting little thinner as we zipped down the East Coast Road to reach Mamallapuram (erstwhile Mahaballipuam),",0
315, The possibility of getting lift was very vague as everybody was standing on the road for lift.,1
316,where only few trains stop by.,0
317, I never knew that the train will stop at vaniyambadi I had ticket till katpadi only but my fellow passengers insisted that I should get down at vaniyambadi.,1
318,This place was good for taking snap as the bus moved on the kavalur the road was covered with gulmohar trees who were on full blooms the field were green and orchard were laden with ripened mango.,0
319,Tada falls is something like 100 kilometers on Chennai which is very much accessible by road and train from Chennai.,1
320, The road is pretty much navigable and there were no traffic issues.,0
321, After trekking on dirt road for around 2 kilometers we came to another small water body which was like major attraction for lot of people.,1
322,We walked the narrow road on the side of a mountain which winded its way through the “Ooty suburbs” consisting of small houses along the hill side forests and beautiful tea fields.,1
323," the big black rocks right by the road and the sea that didn’t seem deterred by them at all and looked so angry like it wanted to swallow the town whole along with me (this was right after a cyclone and I was sure it had its sights set on me),",1
324,Up early Tuesday as we had a train from Kochi to Calcut at 9.,0
325, The train journey was rather uneventful in comparison to my previous one.,1
326, Then we had some free time before having to catch train to Chennai.,1

331,"We caught the train to Villapurum on Sunday instead of the bus,",0
332, I spent the journey on a metal luggage rack above some of the seats – a great way to travel!,0
333," But it's a really interesting training in coping with social issues,",0
334," but then sometimes have to lift buckets of poo + compost out if they're getting full and transport them to the composting area,",1
335, as they took the side road to Ooty and not the main road.,0
336," But as we were staying just for 1 night to get the train the next day,",0
337, it was easier to stay in a place close to the train station.,0
338, Afterwards we made our way to the train station.,0
339, the station master had put us on the waiting list as the train had already been sold out.,0
340, So we wanted to make sure we could get the train by being the first ones in line for the waiting list.,0
341, we were very happy about the little bookshop in the train station where we bought some wonderful books.,1
342, we can highly recommend the toy train ride.,0
343, It was quite comfortable and we had a pleasant journey to Kollam.,0
344, we had to wait for 2 hours to catch another local train to our final destination: Varkala.,0
345," and this local train was exactly the same that you can find when you google """"india train ride"""".",0
346,My journey here was more interesting than most – I left Heathrow on January 22nd 2014 and turned 25 on the plane.,0
347," The woman who took the course was a trained doctor and nutritionist and was incredibly interesting and knowledgeable about a wide range of health impacts and benefits of different foods,",1
348, Whilst drinking our soup a procession came up the road to the temple - effigies were carried under umbrellas accompanied by a band and many priests.,1
349,looking for it on my journey only to find out that it is a specialty of the Annalaksmi the restaurant I was being taken to.,0
350, Once the doors were opened and we were ushered into a beautiful restaurant that really transported one to somewhere else.,1
351,We got dropped off at the train station and our journey began.,0
352, Finding out which platform to be on is only made available a few minutes before the train leaves and then it’s a mad scramble to the correct one.,0
353, Trains are very long with many different classes – we had booked 2nd class a/c .,0
354, seats for express trains in two different categories and then unreserved 2ndclass with wooden or plastic seats crowded with a gazillion people but very cheap.,0
355,which tell you the trains number that is arriving as it comes and others that point out where your carriage will stop and it does!,1
356, Some people have already been on this train for a night and a day looking a bit disheveled -to your berth.,0
357, One turned out to work for the railways and was on his way to some place that meant he would have to get off the train at 4am and the other was pediatric anesthetist who was going to a conference and getting off one stop before us.,0
358,30 train to catch.,0
359, surprise only to find out the train was delayed a bit and then a bit longer and then even a bit longer than that all in all 4 hours later it arrived and oh we could have slept a bit longer in our nice room and had breakfast at the hotel!,0
360, But this station was incredibly clean – as soon as a train had departed railway staff were on the tracks picking up what they could recycle and then hosing down the tracks as even though on the train it says don’t use the toilets when at a station many people simply don’t care.,0
361,Its always a full train cause as soon as a person gets off at a station the place is filled by a newcomer.,0
362," did I tell you how mind boggling it is to actually find the train you need from all the choices you have – fast trains,",1
363, express trains some stopping lots and some hardly at all.,0
364, With the time we had waiting for this train I went and got info for the next trains we were planning on taking and that would prove to be a big help.,1
365,In the morning we made our way back to train station to sort out onward tickets.,0
366, There is a foreign desk there and the agent was so friendly – once again I can’t believe how many trains they have to look through millions of people are travelling all the time sorry to go on about it but it does boggle the mind.,1
367, There was going to be a bit of a wait so I walked the platform photographing trains and people and the interactions between them.,0
368, Very much like the last sleeper train and clearly many people were on-board from earlier overnight travel.,1
369," Getting off was more of a hassle than getting on the train because there were plenty of people trying to force their way onto the carriage,",0
370," When the old train rolled in we were in the right place and Maddy boarded - Grant,",1
371, Peter and Roy all checked out the train ( they got on to inspect the carriage to make sure they thought it was safe).,0

375, At the bottom we were following narrow bitumen roads and dodging traffic.,1
376, Along with dozens of other Jeeps we cruised slowly along the single lane roads spotting animals which were completely unperturbed by our passing.,0
377,"We made an early start with a nice breakfast of """"dosa"""" and headed to the station for a train headed to Incombatore.",0
378,Onto the bus again for a somewhat hair-raising climb up the mountain roads towards the hill station Coonoor.,0
379, and avoiding being run off the road by the crazies coming down the mountain.,0
380,"On the way to the 'toy train' station,",1
381, We arrived a bit early to buy the tickets so we had a chance to walk the streets a bit and check out the steam train that runs the lower and steeper section of the railway using a geared system.,1
382,The train itself was very quaint with little narrow carriages richly trimmed with carved wood.,0
383, perhaps Queensland trains should also be counted as toy train relics of the British Empire?,1
384, It was probably the cheapest transport from only location to another I ever had.,0
385,The boat journey first starts from a larger water surface like a lake and then goes into the narrow lanes inside the mangrove forest.,0
386," The roads on the four sides of the temple are called """"car roads"""" (car means ratha or chariot).",1
387, west car road and south car road at the outside of the temple.,0
388,Through these pictures I will take you through the same journey I went through and show you everything that I saw.,1
389, about 60km journey and picked up our guide on the way who was an Eddie Murpny look alike with the grand name of Marharajah.,1
390, any guides reading this will remember their training at the British Museum which included this process so it was fascinating to watch as they gave us a demo going through the various steps.,1
391, Our driver wanted to get us there early because there would be loads of sugar cane trucks on the road and they could hold us up but we suspected that it was because a) he didn't know where the airport was and b) he had to drive back to Delhi.,1
392, on the whole we were finding it much cleaner and certainly the roads were better.,0
393," and the array of goods being transported on overloaded shoulders,",0
394," even if you are on an unlit road and wagons drawn by oxen are on there too,",0
395, trains and other forms of transportation became widely available.,1
396, regardless of the road you are on and/or how thick or narrow the road is.,1
397," but a barrier divided two lane road on both sides coming to a """"T"""" with another cross street.",0
398, not slowing down for anything until a snake crossed our path on the highway south.,1
399,"we turned off the highway at a juncture obscurely signposted towards Auroville,",0
400, I won’t hit the road even it takes all from me.,0
401,I knew that Tiruvanamalai has a rail station too however the train services were not frequent and hence a ride would be nice enough to get me there.,0
402,80 miles hovering through the newly tarred GST road up to Tindivanam which took just over than 2 hours and then the ‘Green Rider’ took a right towards ‘Senji’ or ‘Ginjee’.,1
403,We had been cruising through the GST road and then after switched to hit the NH 66 which connects between Pondicherry and Krishnagiri.,1
404, I saw a few people dressed in all saffrons marching through the road and later I saw them in Tiruvanamali as well.,0

411, you would expect this to be a pleasant journey up the mountain soaking up the views on route.,0
412, 5 minutes into our journey from the airport to our pre-booked hotel however and already it was starting to look we were in for one hell of a ride.,0
413, The lane separator painted on the road was an absolute waste of the council’s time and money as everyone acted as if it was mere decoration rather than actually having a purpose.,1
414, this wasn’t necessarily due to the city itself as we could only muster the will to get out of the hotel once a day to either buy essentials or book train tickets etc.,0
415,Train Carriage or Prison cell.,1
