2," The pollution is so bad here,",0
3," No matter how many times you view photographs or watch travel shows about the Taj,",0
4, was the grotesque deformities of a number of beggars surrounding the main entrance.,0
5, Beggars are to be found all over the station and totally ignoring them is the only way.,0
6, Organized chaos ensued with people grabbing whatever seats were available and to hell with reservations….,0
7,"This was a pretty boring drive thru endless fields under agriculture,",0
8, The Khajuraho Temples in Madhya Pradesh are amongst the most beautiful medieval monuments in India.,1
9, which means a crossing point between heaven and earth.,1
10," The pollution is so bad here,",0
11," the existing air pollution and incense being burned,",0
12, We needed some quiet time to be able to comprehend at least a little bit what had happened in the 6 days in Vrindavan.,1
13, It was family owned and for dinner that evening we sat in the family's dining room and ate beautiful home cooked (and vegetarian!,1
14, as me and my luggage squeezed through the crowds to the platform furthest away from the entrance.,0
15, beggars and sellers do their rounds on an Indian train.,1
16, rubbish strewn everywhere.,0
17," the white marble still clean and smooth,",1
18, The two red sandstone buildings that flank the Taj would probably have been spectacular sights in themselves had they not been literally overshadowed by the Taj.,1
19,It is as beautiful as they say.,1
20, warm day and the traffic was not so busy.,1
21, The trip would prove to be far easier and more relaxing than the previous one.,1
22, We walked through the huge main gate and admired the view out over the valley then a walk back around the cloisters to the front entrance.,1
23, The gardens surrounding the building are peaceful and even though there were many people there it did not feel crowded.,1
24, The view back to the entrance was grand and up close the walls of the Taj gleamed white.,1
25, We were shown how they do the inlays and then taken to the shop where we eventually bought a beautiful marble plate with a traditional design.,1
26, inlaid with beautiful patterns just like the Taj.,1
27, small but beautiful in their design and decoration.,1
28, This was pleasant as we have been very busy up to now so a relaxing afternoon ensued.,1
29,Many things are spectacular; some quite confronting.,1
30,The old part of Varanasi is a maze of tiny crowded lanes.,0
31, After a bit of research we have found that the greater Delhi area has a population of almost 25 million people!,0
32, London has a population of around 8.,0
33," Delhi also has one of the highest population densities in the world at almost 30,",1
34, breath-taking architecture amazing and a fantastic view of the Taj Mahal.,1
35, We've spent the day relaxing today in Jaipur and will 'hit the sights' tomorrow!,1
36, boats are available for viewing the entire stretch of Varanasi Ghats from a grand stand.,1
37, how can you travel to India without visiting the beautiful Taj Mahal?,1
38,Just before I give you some more information I just want to point out that the Ganges is one of the most polluted water bodies in the world.,1
39, some sh*t trinket souvenir or a beggar coming asking for “bakshish”.,0
40," Sometimes the beggars aren't even poor,",1
41," Once that's been done they're sent to heaven and aren't reincarnated as someone else,",1
42, got stuck in traffic and then dropped off at the main entrance which is the busiest one and had to walk through a park to get there.,1
43, A huge gate purpose build for your first view of the Taj.,1
44, Entering from the side takes away from your initial view of the Taj slightly because you can see the main dome.,0
45, But it was still a beautiful sight.,1
46, It's an absolutely beautiful structure.,1
47, Straight out of the station and into the chaos of Delhi.,0
48, Hotel Atithi was probably the most modern and clean hotel so far.,1
49," Thank heavens our guide sort of pulled us through the security,",1
50," relaxing lunch,",1
51," Although the traffic wasn’t as bad as Delhi,",1
52, it was still pretty chaotic and the ride was longer that I’d figured.,0
53, but not quite as nice or clean as the hotel in Delhi.,0
54, children playing on the street a very relaxed slowed paced way of living.,0
55,check in and went to our rooms to relaxed for a bit.,1
56," We drove through Varanasi's traffic with ricks,",1
57, We then got on a boat (same as the day before) and placed our mats on the top of the boat and started our 1 hour yoga session as the boat moved towards the beach on the other side of the river.,1
58,) I hope I am sin free and clean of bad energy as I did submerge in he Ganges up to my knees!,1
59, Took pictures with the monks and walk around the ruins taking pictures and enjoying the calmness and peace of the temple.,1
60,pretty cool and made he experience even more authentic and peaceful and calmed.,1
61, At that point we were standing or leaning on a small area by a wall holding bags of he others and I started thinking of my previous trip to India around Rajasthan with Kyle and how when I was anxious he would calmed me so much by simply holding my hand or hugging me.,1
62, We got to the hotel and grabbed our yoga mats for a well deserved relaxing class and headed to the ashram.,1
63,The yoga class was amazing I wa sable to focus and relax and let out all the anxiety from he day.,1
64,"The Varanasi market is really crowded and is basic a street food,",0
65, The view of the room where we did yoga (open space) was towards the Ganges.,1
66,- Traffic is insane!,0
67,"Temporary respite from the dirt and squalor of the crowded streets was provided by a western style cafe within a textile shop providing another browsing opportunity,",1
68, I imagined that they were gonna kill Rob in a back Street and that a bunch of men were gonna come into the office kidnap me and sex traffic me like something out of Taken ( completely overreacting!,1
69,"com now) It was a nice experience and we started to feel a little settled again once we ignored the curious and sometimes aggressive stares and the horrific roads of honking horns and near misses with tuk tuks,",1
70, Hindus believe this place is sacred as the lord Shiva (One of the Gods) let goddess Ganges flow from his hair so that people could go peacefully to the other side and also be reincarnated.,1
71, Many of the people in India litter everywhere and a lot of them spit on the floors alot!,1
72, and some cows were able to move along the cramped and crowded lanes.,0
73," cleaned up a little,",1
74, and multitudes of boats crowded the shore for a look.,1
75,calm both so that one might meditate.,1
76, We told him that we would be walking eastwards to see all the ghats in that direction that we hadn't had a chance to view yet.,1
77, I was reminded how liberally Indians honk their horns.,1
78, and in the cramped lanes only motorbikes can go (their horns still suck).,0
79," Certain ghats have more touts and beggars than others so when you're feeling tired,",1
80, it was set on fire as a crowd of people watched.,0
81,now and then different beggars or people trying to sell something would stop by us.,0
82, One beggar had both his arms amputated at the elbow joints.,0
83, responded that the beggar had had his arms cut off so he could try to earn more from begging.,1
84, The lesson took place with an incredible view of the Ganga and for two hours we did Asanas (poses) and Pranayamas (breathing exercises) and then completed with incredible and synchronized OM chants.,0
85, I tried meditating too and after that I walked down to the Ganga and waded my legs into the polluted water.,1
86, and we walked through the evening ceremony at the Main Ghat that was being viewed by hundreds.,1
87," A meal a little later on and a quiet stroll along the narrow lanes,",1
88," Amidst the chaos and cacauphony of life,",0
89,The usual first breathtaking view of the Mausoleum is spoilt by the drizzle and the grey background of the sky against which the Taj seems to dissolve in the thin mist.,1
90, is suffering the ravages of pollution and general degradation.,0
91, It is a beautiful but small white marble structure with exquisite inlay work outside and delicate wall paintings of fruit and flower motifs within.,1
92,could view the Taj.,0
93," There is beautiful blue tile inlay on the outside,",1
94, It was in a beautiful seventeenth century palace.,1
95, There was beautiful artistry throughout.,0
96,I still don't understand how they manage to speed through these crowded narrow roads.,1
97, so much traffic and congestion.,0
98, our drive on the horn all the time.,0
99," Beautifully built,",1
100," Quite crowded but we were able to walk around,",0
101," Presently cleaning the minarets,",1
102, so scaffolding spoiling the view but still very impressive.,1
103,"Considering that one of the most beautiful buildings in the world,",0
104, The early morning sun cast a soft and beautiful glow on the building.,1
105," It has some of the most beautiful carvings that we have seen on our trip so far,",1
106," Just so hard to believe it was built in 1630 by the King to remember his beautiful wife who died giving birth to their 14th child at aged 39,",1
107," While there's a good view of the Taj,",0
108,a name for ourselves as one of the waiting staff apologised for the noise and hoped we'd managed to sleep when it finished.,1
109, I asked him if there were any more parties in the hotel for the next couple of nights and he said that there weren't so it should be quiet - phew!,0
110, This turned out to be incredibly quiet and we walked straight through.,1
111, It's a fantastic view but amazing that the rooftops between there and the Taj have not been taken over as viewing points.,1
112," He kept telling us it was fixed when it wasn't and after we'd been listening to the running water for 20 minutes and somebody turning up to clean up the bathroom after the engineer,",0
113, though with nightmare Delhi traffic and a lost driver only just!,0
114," navigate to the Ganga side ghats and ponder the views above Manikarnika burning ghat,",1
115,A few of the worlds population are lucky enough to see some of the great wonders here on earth.,1
116, Everything that relates to beauty and elegance an be describe to the detailed marvelous architecture.,1
117,"What I found in Ayodhya was a peaceful old charm small city that decried the tumultuous events of 1992,",1
118, with people leading simple lives oriented around the worship of Lord Rama in a beautiful central temple where it was clear many pilgrims came from afar to visit and receive blessings.,1
119, People in the neighbouring streets were quietly and peacefully going about their business.,1
120, In my view he was a saint to be emulated for sure.,1
121," Nous gardons notre calme et le prenons au mot… Nous attendons tout de même le photographe pour récupérer les photos prises au début de la visite,",1
122," We had a big clean room,",1
123," a super clean bathroom,",1
124, bottled soda in the cafe just to enjoy our first view of the Taj.,0
125, What a beautiful building.,1
126,wonderful views of the Taj.,1
127, But a very nice view anyway.,1
128, And Nina decided to head south into the warmer parts of India for a relaxed time on the beach.,1
129, The beauty of Vrindavan lies beyond what we see.,1
130, It was a full moon night and it was a really great atmosphere - with the full moon shining over the fields around Vrindavan.,1
131, He was very proud of his beautiful daughter.,1
132," tourists numbering more than twice the population of Agra pass through its gates to catch a once-in-a-lifetime glimpse of what is widely considered the most beautiful building in the world ……and we were there,",0
133, gazing at that beauty - I will never take our luck for granted.,1
134,"thousands of semi-precious stones in beautiful patterns,",1
135,We also enjoyed the view alongside of the Yamuna River (which used to be crocodile infested).,1
136," We set off from the hotel expecting to jump in a tuk-tuk however we ended up walking along the road which was crowded with cars,",1
137,"Throughout the day we would have to stop and move aside as men carried bodies beautifully covered in orange silk and flowers,",1
138," Our hotel was clean and quiet,",1
139, The title as the most beautiful building in the world is very much deserved and we could have spent all day wandering around the gardens.,1
140,In the afternoon we visited the Baby Taj (smaller but older and arguably more beautiful than the Taj Mahal) and the Mosque and Palace (Fatehpur Sikri) 40km north of Agra in the town of Sikri.,1
141,After a quick clean up at the hostel we headed out and made a beeline for the closest ghat.,1
142," people just relaxing by the ganges from younger to older groups sat together,",1
143, the odd holy man with long dreadlocks sat on their own at peace and the odd tourist here and there.,0
144," It felt like a nice relaxing place for a local,",1
145,would see your attempt to relax as an invite to try harder and more insistently than the last.,1
146, The views from the ganges were quite impressive as we took in all the buildings and unused ghats as well as the greenery on the opposite side of the river to the more rural areas of Varanasi.,1
147,hectic India we were definitely looking forward to some relaxation and a slower pace in South India.,1
148, clean with plush interiors .,1
149, The three of us were in a hurry to reach Baga Beach and of course come back within the 4 hours limit.,1
150, So you girls want to look around or just go to the beach directly.,1
151," And here we were heading towards the beach in the beautiful yet unknown place to us ,",1
152,"Beautiful houses painted in greens,",1
153, colourful dresses and peaceful faces … that’s what I could see all around me.,1
154," A place could actually be beautiful and peaceful and fun and yet not be a Bollywood set ,",1
155, beaches and the resorts .,1
156,That four hour visit to the beach and back was like a refresher course in the past and the present of Goa.,1
157," this time not only was fun filled because of the beautiful sunset at beach and the gaiety and festivity around ,",1
158, the beaches clean and the town peaceful .,1
159," A true gentleman with a clean soul ,",1
160, We had a really clear view of the cremation area.,0
161," Anna bought a beautiful Saree,",1
162, then have an hour to relax before setting off for the last auspicious ceremony later tonight.,1
163, and traffic of all descriptions!,0
164," The traffic was so crazy,",0
165," Anna also felt that the crowds were just too much,",0
166, some saying it’s the most beautiful thing they'd ever laid eyes on.,0
167, we'd heard the best time to view the Taj Mahal is at sunrise.,1
168," The best spot to view the palace at sunrise is actually from Agra fort,",1
169,morning the crowds weren't too big and the air was cool.,1
170, The view was amazing.,1
171,Both rooms were not dingy by any means and also had amazing views of the taj mahal.,1
172,It was lovely to walk around and admire this beauty but in the sun the marble floors were very hot.,1
173, We understood the streets were chaotic but the train stations too!,0
174, You could certainly see that it was every monkey for themselves as they scrapped over rubbish and food thrown onto the tracks.,1
175,"All that traffic on the tracks: trains,",0
176," I wandered around the busy streets of Varanasi (the traffic is MENTAL),",0
177,"View of Yamuna River,",1
178," They mention the pollution of the river and the streets,",0
179, the ever present chaos and noise.,1
180," but it was such a clean cut and with ca 1 cm still at place,",0
181," Although very clean (they were expecting the visit of President Obama who never showed up),",1
182," Crowded beyond belief,",0
183, and with that the usual random crowd of men gathered to stare.,0
184, The place was stinking and again there was litter and honking horns everywhere.,0
185," sitting in the sun listening to honking horns,",0
186," but even if it was just a reduction in litter and pollution,",0
187, and Varanasi which probably belch out a thousand per cent more pollution in 1 day than London does in a year.,0
188," the noise and the filth,",0
189, I met some nice Australian and British girls and we first went to the Lotus Temple by a tuktuk and experienced the caotic and very noisy traffic and saw lots of almost-accidents.,0
190, followed the crowd that left the central station and accidently found the old Delhi market at night.,0
191," chaotic but save place,",0
192,(3) Red Fort is a very big building but the counter area was crowded and the counter line very long.,1
193," a peaceful park with a Ghandi monument,",1
194, I became more fascinated by the peaceful openness towards every religion.,1
195," The high and drunk men were seriously freaking out and a crowd of 30 or more appeared around me,",0
196, those first Rays of the morning sun glistened on the water and it actually looked like a beautiful serene place.,1
197," always had clean faces for bedtime,",1
198, It really was beautiful and very skilled intricate work.,1
199, He offered us tea and it was actually a nice relaxed environment with plenty of time to look and appreciate the product with no hard sell.,1
200, They were beautiful and so colourful.,1
201," I'd like to think she'd bought some clean underwear since Delhi,",1
202," but I reckoned I could probably pick one up in Aldershot for the same price given that there is a huge Nepalese population in the town,",1
203," no longer would I be going out of my way to keep quiet-I decided to take a leaf from Molly Brown and do what I would be doing if I had a room to myself,",0
204," I had a shower and I wasn't best pleased when I noticed she hadn't cleaned the toilet and used my facecloth that was on top of my wash bag,",1
205, chose to reverse that part instead to pull up outside of the shop-all with oncoming traffic beeping us out of the way.,0
206, they were almost crowding around us.,0
207, I deliberated weather or not to hold on or risk leaving my bags and chance what would probably be a honking smelly toilet.,1
208, It was so nice just to feel clean and relax and I was really looking forward to seeing the sunset tonight.,1
209, There were more cows and more motorbikes (a pair of cows were even locking horns in the middle of the road with vehicles swerving around them) it was the most insane place yet.,0
210," It just seemed peaceful and without sounding like a complete moron,",1
211," one of the most beautiful buildings and iconic landmarks on earth,",1
212,was a good example of why the English are so rubbish at cricket: here was the evidence they couldn't bowl.,1
213, It was so cleverly designed and built from red sandstone and it was just a lovely place in general with beautiful gardens and flowers.,1
214, Shar Jahan ordered that the workmen have their hands chopped off to stop them ever recreating anything so beautiful ever again.,1
215, All polluting traffic is now banned from driving within a certain radius of the building now and instead you hop on a type of electric bus to get to the entrance.,0
216, The guards where blowing whistles at those taking pictures and it was generally chaotic-not the serene final resting place you'd think.,1
217,Up early and down to the temple the security was quiet tight and I was frisked twice; it was strange to see members of so many different sects in one place many engaged in devotions.,1
218, and for the most part it is horribly chaotic place.,0
219," never regarding the traffic lanes,",1
220, and only sometimes acknowledging the traffic lights.,1
221," how do you drive into oncoming traffic at 100 mph,",0
222,"Second driving lesson: They honk their car horns all day and all night long,",0
223, Even the back of the trucks have signs saying ""horn"" or ""horn please.,0
224," Other vehicles driving in the chaos are rickshaws,",0
225," Around every corner of the complex there is a new beautiful detail with ancient Hindu and Muslim architecture,",1
226, where you can get a good view of the whole lake and palace complex.,1
227,many intricate embroidered rugs and a gorgeous crystal chandelier that I believe our guide said was a gift from another country.,1
228,""""" The one thing our guide was able to tell us about this place was that the many beautiful windows of the Hawa Majal weren't only used for decoration but that they also had some sort of screen on them that allowed cool breeze to come in and that permitted the ladies to look through to view the proceedings of the people down below.",1
229, It made us thank the heavens we had not traveled here with our husbands because they probably would have been bored to death!,1
230, which are seriously one of the most gorgeous traditional dress styles in the world.,1
231, We also went to a shoe store and got these gorgeous Indian style shoes which all had intricate beads and colorful designs on them.,1
232," This means driving right into oncoming traffic in the pitch dark night,",0
233," You have to ride a pollution free vehicle up to the Taj Mahal,",1
234, these strict rules are in place in order to keep the air around it as clean as possible and to maintain a protected barrier.,1
235," It was very crowded and we knew it was only going to get worse,",0
236, The traffic was worse and the hotel we stayed at wasn't so great.,0
237, as well as taking several quiet moments to pray and contemplate.,0
238, nestling serenely on a mountain backdrop staring at the snow capped Himalayas.,1
239," quiet days saw us exploring tiny markets,",1
240, in a restaurant which also nestled into the mountain side as the sun set over the snow caps.,1
241,The Taj is the most exquisitely beautiful building I have ever seen.,1
242," with no litter or discarded plastic bags in sight,",1
243, some wearing really beautiful saris.,1
244," no plastic litter allowed,",1
245," relaxed and refined place with fine Taj views),",1
246, The platform was crowded with people.,0
247,"green fields with both men and women working in them by hand,",1
248," loads of rubbish everywhere (mainly shredded plastic),",0
249, At every level crossing there were crowds of people on bicycles waiting for the train to pass.,0
250,along crowded streets.,0
251, There is a rooftop restuarant with a fine view over the Ganges and a staircase leads you down to the walk along the riverfront.,1
252," beggars and holymen asking for money,",0
253, We are so lucky that we can slink back to the quiet of our room or the rooftop restuarant.,1
254," In the mornings there is a rather nice mist over the Ganges,",1
255, but according to the locals it wasn’t crowded at all (due to the inclement weather).,0
256, I quickly realised that I’d hate to be here on a crowded day!,1
257, I needed a couple of extra strength Kingfisher beers to calm the green chillies we’d ordered on the side (or at least that was my excuse).,1
258," The traffic chaos was unbelievable,",0
259, but I caught glimpses of villages and fields covered in a yellow flowering plant as we sped by (I later learnt it was mustard/rapeseed).,1
260," This was the India of documentaries on poverty – with rubbish heaps randomly scattered through streets,",1
261," We saw the beautifully decorated rooms where Shah Jahan had spent his last days,",1
262, I really wished we had better light for our photographs so that I could have captured the depth of the beauty in the design here.,1
263," It was a super clean hotel and the room was smallish but very,",1
264, the view of the Taj Mahal from the hotel rooftop wasn’t a selling point.,1
265, where he had a view of the Taj Mahal and supposedly stared at it for the rest of his days.,1
266,The red sandstone walls that surround the Taj Mahal prevented it from being viewed from the road.,1
267, we walked towards the grand gate - which is a spectacular arch of red sandstone directly in front of the Taj Mahal.,1
268, but it was certainly a majestic and breathtaking sight when we finally stepped through the archway and were faced with the sheer size and beauty of it – a mass of white marble set amid beautiful formal gardens.,1
269," It has such a beautiful and magical atmosphere,",1
270," Even though crowd numbers were down due to the weather,",0
271," I think the sum of the parts of the complex is far more beautiful in its symmetry and effect,",1
272, I loved the practical aspects of the fort’s architecture and the clever and beautiful additions that converted parts of it into palaces.,1
273,Even with the fog in the area it was still spectacular to see.,1
274, Lol but the view and the scenery along the way was spectacular.,1
275, You could easily spend half a day wandering around these beautiful but crumbling examples of Mughal architecture.,1
276, thankfully it is a peaceful place today.,1
277,The rooms were quite clean and big.,1
278," The Taj is one of the most well preserved and architecturally beautiful tombs in the world,",1
279," The fort has a beautiful view of his masterpiece,",1
280,"The town is relatively peaceful and green,",1
281," I wonder if they are in the same category as people claiming Delhi airport to be super hectic and chaotic; when we there we saw no evidence of that,",0
282," It probably would if you weren't dodging traffic and weaving through the crowd,",0
283, the dailly schedule seems chaotic and intense to my English sensibilities.,1
284,30am boat trip along the Ganga gave a rare opportunity to experience a quiet and peaceful Varanasi.,1
285, a handful of others also staying at Mishra beside us in the wooden boat that was being rowed by a quiet local.,0
286,They were also very beautiful in a stark and haunting way.,1
287, During winter North India experiences thick fog that gave the beautiful gardens of Dhamma Chakka a ghostly quality beneath the compound's blue-white lightbulbs.,1
288, The 10 Day course spent the first three days focused entirely on anapanna (mindfulness of breathing) to calm and focus the mind before teaching vipassana on Day 4.,1
289, and even species (ie the points of view of non-human life) have the potential for near infinite possibilties.,1
290, The moon is stuck like horns above a tree.,1
291, It was a classic Delhi view - the city stretching out before you until it disappeared into the smoggy haze.,1
292, In the smaller version you get in Delhi they don't allow you to sit next to the driver so Jane had to sit on someone's knee and the three boys jammed on the seat.,0
293," The Agra fort probably upstages the Red Fort with its views of the Taj,",1
294,The mist cleared as we reached Fatapur Sikri.,1
295, The palace had some beautiful carvings and a unique monument to Akbar's favourite elephant executioner (it used to crush criminals in front of him).,1
296," There was clean sheets,",1
297, Though there were many other people there its size meant it was peaceful and calm.,1
298, It was a much needed break from the chaos of India we'd experienced so far.,0
299, with an understanding but low opinion of India's caste system and fairly critical views of the machismo of Indian men.,0
300, We spent 20 minutes or so looking around the beautiful hall of the Bara Imambara before heading upstairs to what I thought would be the balconies.,1
301, After reaching the balcony and getting a lovely view across the Lucknow we decided to return to the front gate and move onto another attraction further down the road.,1
302,"After a chaotic first week in India,",0
303, The hostel had a open relaxation area and up stairs a kitchen we could use.,1
304,"The past 48 hours have been a chaos of our mistakes,",0
305, It was so beautiful with the light and candles.,0
306, we finally got a rickshaw to drop us at the Ganges and it wasn’t long before we had searched and found a room at Hotel Ganges View just south of Assi Ghat on the Ganges River.,1
307,Slightly above our budget (as we were in need of some pampering) we paid up the room for 6 nights for 9000 rupees and decided to sit tight with a little view for my birthday week.,1
308, After a few beeping horns and a great cheeky Chai I decided to head back to the room to take advantage of our satellite TV and comfy bed.,0
309,in the morning Casey was feeling much better so we decided to take a little stroll down the river to check out a few of the main sights here on one of the most polluted rivers in the world.,0
310, On our stroll from the south you begin by passing small lanes filled with dust that is created from the traffic and dried out cow dung that I have to say doesn’t make most of the streets in Varanasi comfortable to walk around.,0
311," Now I had been reading about the on goings around these waterways and you often read of the rubbish and pollution,",0
312,luckily for us the prime minister had visited a few days ago so in a matter of hours India was sparkling clean by Indian standards anyway.,1
313, The Ganges almost looked clean enough to swim in.,1
314,The difference between walking through the streets to walking alongside the river is the calmness you can feel whilst at the water’s edge.,1
315,Further North you quickly see the day to day activities of Varanasi locals and amongst them you will see beautifully dressed women and half nude men all washing themselves and the households laundry in the heavily polluted river.,1
316," You can see people washing Laundry near piles of collected rubbish and even further north,",1

326, but all got out of bed sleepily to greet us and make us some beautiful Chai.,1
327,It did have views to the Taj Mahal.,1
328, Its a small area close to the Taj that you can view the Taj Mahal against the backdrop of a sunset and popular with tourists and locals alike.,1
329, A few of the local boys decided to become fixated on beautiful Taylor and in the end I had to tell them I was her mother and to leave her alone!,1

333, Beautiful even from that distance.,1
334, We then headed off to our hotel to relax before heading out to see the Taj Mahal.,1
335, It was breath taking to see the Taj Mahal as it is more beautiful than we ever expected it to be.,1
336, It was a dream come true to see it and spend time in such a beautiful setting.,1
337," We relaxed and chatted,",1
338,The noise made by the looms was really loud.,0
339," relaxing and chatting about Jude's university work,",1
340," Jude and I opted for a quiet meal on our own,",0
341, dogs and cows roaming and crazy drivers beeping horns and people milling around on there way to or from somewhere.,0
342,It was quite a peaceful experience and we saw fish jumping and Dushyant said they even had fresh water dolphins!,0
343, So may be the water isn't as polluted as we westerners think.,1
344, You submerge yourself under the water 3 times and then chant and it is supposed to cleans your soul and absolve your sins and make you pure again.,1
345, We took the boat to small sand bank in the middle of the river where it was less crowded and cleaner.,1
346, Dushyant calmed the situation down and I deleted the shots which seemed to offend.,1
347," It was very beautiful so sat and watched it from our boat on the river for a while listening to the monks chant,",1
348, Then a tuk tuk home to the hotel We got stuck in traffic and found ourselves being followed by a man who had taken a shine to Mary and was walking with his dick out in his hand.,1
349," We moved slowly through the traffic and he kept catching up to us,",0
350,The train was very crowded and many of the passengers were police and army people returning home after the elections.,0
351," It was noisy with people walking past chatting or on the phone - hello hello,",1
352," noisy people sitting on the edge of our beds,",1
353, As usual we had to dodge to maic traffic and avoid an early death on the roads lol but we managed it and all arrived at the air conditioned hotel all in one piece.,0
354, It's hot sweaty and very noisy work.,0
355," The replies we visited are amazing and still look so new and beautiful and the photos do not do them justice,",1
356, However the crowds soon flocked in and spoiled the natural beauty.,0
357, at its peak around 99k visitors a day can view the monument.,1
358," It's a vast complex cleverly built on a hill side with a 360 view of the surrounding area surrounded by a 16KM wall to protect it,",1
359, Some of them were beautifully painted and I hope to upload some photos on here soon so you can all see.,0

363," We are staying in a small family run hotel which is basic but clean and comfortable,",1
364,They also collect the cow dung and dry it out nard use it to fuel their fires and then use the ashes to clean the dishes.,1

367, At this point i conveniently found an amazing viewing spot off the path on a huge boulder right in prime location for sunrise watching.,1
368, The sun peeked over the mountains and we watched in awe as it bathed the valley and city in golden light.,1
369, After sitting for half an hour or so the rest of the group came back down and sat with us for a few minutes taking in the view before we walked back down and walked to a restaurant for breakfast.,1
370, I had the mixed fruit pancake which was immense and just what I needed after climbing up most of a mountain and coming back down all before 9am!,1
371," Danielle relaxed by the pool,",1
372, This was beautiful and I really enjoyed the intricate and dainty architecture as well as the many shades of colours.,1

375," He then started making noises and splashing at the water and then behold,",1
376, It was beautiful and there was a great viewpoint of the two mahul which gave us our first glimpse of this wonder.,1
377," for me I haven't seen the Taj Mahul from this side and to be honest I think it is my favourite view with the river in front of it,",1
378,"We were cream cracked after this so relaxed and had a delicious Indian thali meal,",0
379, It had a rooftop restaurant with great view of the snaking Ganges and the buildings hugging its eastern shores.,1
380, cleaning their clohes and cleaning themselves to using it as a toilet or a pen to keep their water Buffalo in.,0
381, I felt like we were leaving the calm and into the storm.,0
382,and stressed my foot was going to need a total clean out at the hospital for absolutely no reason at all.,0
383," l have read that the ganges pollution levels are 3000 over the 'safe' limit,",1
384, if not for getting away from the busy streets below to relax or the great views but to see Monkeys getting chased off by the owners dogs!,1
385," We spent most of our time there learning about the history of this beautiful building,",1
386, but perhaps the noise and press of the crowd made it seem less special.,0
387, but how can one enjoy beauty if people are shoving and pushing and whistles are being blown into your ear?,0
388," Singhji says that sometimes it is so crowded that even he does not want to enter the impressive Taj Mahal,",0
389, as the noise and smell and crush of the masses of people can be overwhelming.,0
390, a gorgeous white marble building that almost every visitor to India must see.,1
391, We gingerly tiptoed through the alley until we reached a mass crowd of people lining up to get in a small temple door.,1
392, Instead it turned out that my mosquito repellant was a dangerous article (deodorants etc ok but mosquito repellant not).,1
393," after admiring the view of the sunny day outside,",1

406," Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal To ensure that no other living structure would ever rival the beauty of the Taj Mahal,",1

412, on the opposite side of the river Yamoona to the Taj Mahal where his favourite wife is buried and this gave us some lovely views of the Taj Mahal itself.,1
413, it really is such a contrast from the chaos outside to the serenity inside and of course the luxury and comfort inside to the poverty and sadness in the street.,1
414," crowded with people so we didn't get a Princess Diana moment but Delboy knew all the photoshots and where to take them,",1
415," It is such a beautiful building,",1
416," It would be nice to walk around in peace and calm,",1
417, noisy - everything we had experienced but greatly magnified - but that is what Varanasi is all about!,0

420," noisy spiritual experience with ringing bells,",1
421, no crowds in front of us for the first 10 minutes - pictures of the Taj Mahal in its pure and pristine elegance.,1
422, and watched a beautiful sunset.,1
423, with most of the men taking an early morning dump in the middle of the field next to the tracks!,0
424," no english but plenty of crowd whistling and shouting gave us an idea,",0
425, From Agra we travelled up to Varanasi where we walked hurriedly between traffic coming from every direction to the Ganges to watch the sunset and ceremonies the accompany it.,1
426, It was so relaxed compared to India and the hustle and bustle that came with it.,1
427, We spent a lovely day with Henry and Haydon showing us about Durbur square and walked upto monkey temple to get an incredbile view of the whole of this awesome city.,1
428, I could already see why this was classed as one of the most beautiful buildings ever constructed.,1
429," To say it’s beautiful is really an understatement,",1
430," Looking at the Taj Mahal from the ‘classic postcard view’ doesn’t get boring,",1
431, and with the world’s most beautiful building in our view we sat back and basked in the moment.,1
432," The fact that this place would bring us burning corpses and people bathing in one of most polluted rivers in the world still however,",1
433, fairly quiet and the room was half decent albeit a little dark.,1
434,"After this relaxing tour of Sarnath,",1
435, we hurtled towards the ceremony at an unbelievable pace considering the amount of traffic on the roads.,0
436," Narrowly missing the ‘traffic police’ (Cows in the middle of the road) as well as pot holes and humans,",0
437, and the tranquillity and calm of being some of the only people on the river gave us a great feeling of peace.,0
438,peaceful it is within the University walls in comparison to the hustle and bustle of Varanasi outside.,1
439," and after dismissing the hawkers selling death views from balconies and other vantage points,",0
440, There above me to the left was a man on a gorgeous little balcony.,1

446, it was quiet and not too crowded.,1
447," It’s beautiful in pictures,",1
448, and it’s just as beautiful in person.,1
449, just because it was so unexpectedly beautiful and pleasant inside.,1
450,We had another of my favorite experiences in India while eating breakfast on the hotel roof in view of the Taj Mahal.,1
451, There are a lot of beggars there who seem to make do alright because pilgrims are likely to give alms.,1

461," There are no traffic lights,",0
462," horns blare non-stop,",0
463,You can only handle so much Varanasi before you need to escape to a quiet place.,1
464, Luckily we had an amazing guesthouse that was located 10 minutes outside the old city in a quiet area.,1
465, Our room was big and clean with air conditioning!,1
466, All of the traffic began to swarm around the vehicle.,0
467, I don’t know if it so much for respect of the structure as it is to keep it clean and the marble shiny.,1
468," There is also a beautiful orange stone called the fire of India and when light hits it,",1
469, All were very beautiful and VERY expensive and heavy.,1

478," the view of the banks from the river should be beautiful too as you take in the sight and sound of evening prayers,",1
479, the banks are very crowded and we stay for some time before returning to the hotel.,1
480,after the temple darshan or viewing we are stressed as its very crowded and generally there's a lot of pushing and pulling as is the case with all famous Hindu temples.,1
481,in the evening we stroll down to Nadesar House opposite the Taj and it is this beautiful palace now converted to an emporium.,1
482, my friend had also told me about the gorgeous benarasi silk sarees that Taj can arrange for you to buy from but we refrain from that since I already possess many of them.,1
483, We were ahead of most of the traffic on the roads into Kashi and were dropped off with our guide at the main entrance.,0

486," We took turns viewing the temple and during my turn,",0
487," Michelle waited in one of the clean stores selling aryuvedic oils,",0

490," The crowds of people,",0
491, We also got to view their vegetable garden used to prepare dishes for the restaurant.,1
492,"We started out on the broad crowded streets on the periphery of Kashi and steadily moved towards the river through increasingly narrow streets,",1
493, From here we viewed the previously mentioned sites from a discreet distance providing a new perspective.,1
494, Our guide helped us to view this from a balcony above and then moved us to a position just beneath one alter.,1
495, a pollution intensive industry.,0
496, our room has a direct view of the Taj Mahal.,1
497, it was raining so hard our view was obscured.,0
498, We pushed our way through the crowds (it was REALLY packed).,0
499, allowing us to view the Taj Mahal without rain pouring down.,1
500," Although designed to view against a bright blue sky,",1

509," It may be simplistic to say that the Indians seem so calm in the midst of this apparent nationwide chaos,",0
510, it's a weird combination; revering the waters of the Mother Ganges while at the same time polluting her to sickness.,1
511, which is so polluted I didn't even run my hands through its waters - a very un-me thing to do.,1
512," Do a little research and you will see how this river is polluted to such levels I'm convinced these people just may be the strongest people on the planet,",1

544," Most of the hotels and restaurants in Agra advertise their views of the Taj,",1
545, what a beautiful site.,1
546, The garbage cities give way to fields of grains and even greenery.,1
547, It seemed clean and the owner gave me a cold bottle of water on arrival and showed me their stunning rooftop restaurant overlooking the Ganges.,1
548, The reason I wanted to go to Varanasi was to see the Hindu religious ceremonies for the dead and the morning bathing rituals in the beautiful but very murky Ganges.,1
549,The temple while beautiful seemed a way of forcing people into giving money for blessings which reminded me of the pre-Lutheran church.,1
550, The hotel itself was in a suburb of Agra and the room was clean even if the shower was again cold.,1
551, I can easily say I have never seen a more beautiful building.,1
552, Unfortunately it wasn't a very clear night so it was difficult to see the Taj's changing colours but the view was still awe-inspiring.,1
553, what can I say… the Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen.,1
554," We couldn’t believe that we were standing in front of the Taj Mahal and it was us they wanted pictures of :/ We also couldn’t get over the “you -beautiful” remarks,",1
555,"Yet of course for every (uncalled for) ‘beautiful’ remark we do have to have a little giggle at the men who refer to us as “healthy” looking … at the same time this is being said,",1
556, Naast de enorme chaos moesten we ook wennen aan de hitte met zo’n 45 graden.,0
557,"Om de chaos even te ontsnappen hebben we een dagtrip gemaakt naar het vredige Sarnath: de plek waar Boeddha zijn beroemde eerste “teachings” gaf over de middenweg naar nirvana,",0
558, Het gaat zelfs zover dat de Chinese regering door middel van censuur de Tibetanen afschildert als “Peaceful Terrorists” richting haar eigen volk.,1
559,and beggars come to the Kumbh Mela to gain something for themselves.,0
560, Standing out in the Rainbow Camp you could hear all of the noise blending together to form a hum that lasted all day and all night.,1
561, the rest of the time I dearly enjoy the solitude and quietness of the Rainbow Camp.,1
562, The Rainbow Camp was a peaceful paradise in a world of chaos and noise.,1
563, After a few days someone discovered that if you walked 10 minutes to the right of camp you would come upon a clean tributary that was secluded and perfect for swimming.,1
564, Daily we would walk over to the swimming hole to swim and relax and completely forget about the Mela.,0
565,and shows another way of viewing the world.,0
566," Although it was a large crowd I doubt it was anywhere close to 200,",1
567,Immediately as we started digging a huge crowd gathered to see what the crazy foreigners were doing.,0

569," thick-walled streets heavily populated with people,",1
570," with the crowds of people in boats and on shore,",0
571, and I was a little disappointed we did not have the time to stop at this elegant shop filled with an array of beautiful long black dresses designed for Muslim women.,1

573,LH is in a quiet residential area about 1km from the main market and 3km from the train station.,0

581,The roads are pretty good and we get to the Fort View Hotel at 8-00pm.,1
582, We head for the Sheesh Mahal restaurant as its location is good in the middle of the palaces (and it serves beer) but the menu is rubbish so we go back into town to explore more options.,1
583," the town is bustling and noisy though in a good way – from the LP description we’d expected a quiet backwater,",0
584, The bustling and noise is because Orchha is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus – it has the only Temple in India where Ram is revered as a King (Ram Raja Temple).,1
585, The ground level view looks fine to us.,1
586," We thought that there may be some fun in the neighbourhood which is a pretty middle class area and it’s likely to be less problematic as Holi can get a bit chaotic in some places with oil colours,",1
587," After a quiet breakfast,",1
588,"their makeshift """"shops"""" as well as beggar children who followed us around asking for money,",0

606,I don't think we have ever experienced such chaos as met us in the Old City's Chandni Chowk.,0
607, all in as many lanes as it takes to keep the traffic splashing in puddles and every last man fighting for supremacy.,1

616, which was a 5 min walk from the Taj Mahal and the hotel rooftop restaurant and incidentally our room had views of the Taj.,1
617, so beautiful so surreal!,1
618,The next commissioned shop was in a jewelry store but neither of us was interested and even though the stones and jewels were beautiful we just weren´r interested enough and not completely sure they were authentic.,1
619, I noticed that there was a signed by the entrance that said that the area was 0% pollution free!,1

636," this massive city was 'considerably larger than London and more populous' according to Ralph Fitch,",0

657,"view of the narrow muddy path with its crazy turns,",0
658, cliffs and it was really scary drive and I was actually praying so we would survive without falling over the mountain cliff edge.,0
659, we already knew we loved this place with its high mountains and pretty landscape and wheat fields looking like paddy fields and we saw our first monkey on the way up.,1
660,"When we reached a mountain village Sult Mahadev,",1
661, The village was surrounded by high mountains and we still didn't know that it's not our final destination.,1
662," Actually not a walk but proper treck up the mountain and as we were walking,",1
663," Indu pointed out on a few white houses on the top of the mountain and that was our final destination,",1
664, the more amazing view was arising in front of us and you could feel the peace of this place.,1
665, On the top of the mountain and completely out of this world.,1
666, Had to take the crazy bus down the mountains again to much colder Ramnagar and quickly buy some new clothes as everything we had was filthy at this stage of our trip.,1
667," We were driving for ages and then we saw this noisy parade with lights,",0
668, it didn't take long for the crowds to make a new circle around us.,0
669, The way I always imagined Taj Mahal is this huge huge beautiful building.,1
670, that we have pretty much pictures free of the usual crowds and got completely drenched.,1
671, we asked our driver and our guide to take us to a shop so we could buy something new and clean and mainly dry!,1
672, brick factories and mustard seed plants fields and it was getting warmer and sunny again.,0
673," It is noisy and crazy but not too much in comparison to Delhi or Mumbai,",0
674, super crowded and it is pretty much impossible to find an accommodation and the prices are sometimes up to 10 times higher than usual.,1
675, Maybe it is just too busy now for a quiet mediation or maybe I am not ready for that yet.,1
676, So we are leaving the holy city a little bit earlier than we planned (just in two days) and we will try to reach some nice and quiet beaches near Kolkata to recover from all the madness and hopefully to celebrate Davy's birthday somewhere nice.,1
677, So we arrived in Delhi but only stayed a few hours as we were heading for Ramnagar up north in the mountains to meet our indian friend Indu who we know from back home.,1
678," as we got further up the mountains the roads became thinner so much that only one vehicle could fit but they made 2 fit,",0
679, the edge of the road on 1 side was just looking straight up a cliff and the other side was looking down a shere drop off a mountain and of course we got the 2 front window seats.,1
680,"The mountains were just amazing,",1
681, our first in a temple and after that it was almost a 3 hour trek up to meet the rest of the family high in the mountain and to where we would stay for the next 4 or 5 days.,1

684, we went and after getting inside the gates the heavens opened up and the rain was actually hurting is was coming down so hard and so fast it was almost like a river.,1
685," seen a tiny but gorgeous and ancient temple tucked away in the backstreets,",1
686, We had absolutely crazy week with an absolute highlight of our trip in the mountains with Indu and with some down in other places.,1
687, We found our pick-up straight away with a minimum of hassle which took us straight to the right hotel and we were checked into a clean enough room in minutes.,1
688," Whilst skyping my mum an increasingly loud drumming noise approached,",1
689, The chaos had begun.,0
690,Varanasi is a city with the approximate population of Auckland whose people play out their daily lives for all to see on the ghats on the banks of the Ganges.,1

692, cars overtake into oncoming traffic or occasionally undertake on pavements.,0
693, The view from the boat wasn't really any better than the view from the ghats.,0
694,his cell had a great view of his famous mausoleum across the road.,1
695, exactly as tall as wide and the size of external lettering gradually increased with height so to appear the same size when viewed from ground level.,1
696, It was a 5 min walk from the Taj Mahal and the hotel rooftop restaurant and incidentally our room had views of the Taj.,1
697, It's rather difficult to describe the interiors of the forts given the complexities of the history and the seeming chaoticness of the layout.,1
698, The Taj Mahal was a majestic piece of architecture widely thought of as the most beautiful building in the world.,1
699, After an aggressive negotioation with the entry guard and a 'guide' (Aneirin had to get his phone out to 'call the police' to get them to bug off) we managed to bribe our way up the public minaret which afforded us spectacular views of the city's vast canopy around us.,1
700, a near-constant orchestra of horns provides the entirely approproiate soundtrack to whichthe city pulses.,0
701," The junction from which the most noise eminated was in the process of playing out a traffic-planner's nightmare as the scarcely-followed rules of the world were totally abandonned in the pileup of tuktuks,",0
702, and a crush ofhuman traffic filtering through.,0
703," We scampered onto the metro which happened to be at it's most jam-packed (rush hour) so after an incredibly sweaty journey we spilled out to our departure station,",0
704," On reaching the river bank of the most polluted river in the world,",1
705, plus many traffic police.,1
706," beggar children,",0
707, chaotic and crowded.,0
708, Inside I found a somewhat quiet section and used it to take a break from the crowds and to get a better view of the scope.,1
709,Once back I relaxed for a bit before finding a rare sit-down restaurant and had some pasta.,1
710,Varanasi greeted us with horns blaring and people absolutely everywhere.,1
711, As the mists clear in the morning an empty sand bank appears across the other side of the epic river.,1
712," Another train ride jam packed with burps (nearly into my mouth),",0
713,beautiful but most people only really seemed to care about taking the typical 'pinching the spire on tiptoe' photos.,0
714,"Beautiful views from Shaniya Palace Hotel,",1
715, the centre of Delhi doesn’t look quite as chaotic as it was when we were here a couple of months ago.,1
716," Not sure much has changed – maybe we have just got more accustomed to the chaos and it all appears normal,",1
717, beauty and presence of what it looked like even 15 years ago when we came here last and definitely not a patch on what it was when M saw it as a boy.,1
718, The sad fact is that poor management of local tourists have caused the demise of what was once a beautiful sight – even with all the “security” around Indian visitors were trampling all over the site venturing into forbidden areas.,1
719, clean and have good shops and facilities – part of the new modern India.,1
720, It has a great location and an awesome vibe; feels like a really relaxed travellers pad.,1
721, There is a Roof top restaurant with great views down the river – or is it up?,1
722,(Travellers tip: Beware the guys who claim to be from the local Hospice and try and get friendly with local information or offer to take you to a close spot where you can take pictures or get a better view – all they are after is your money.,1

724, and lovely alternative views of the ghats.,1
725,rooms – as its two interconnected rooms - have great views of the Taj.,1
726,The roof top view is awesome and given that we are literally next to the Oberoi hotel which probably costs 100 times more per day we have picked a good one here.,1
727, On the drive we encounter a strike rally which causes total chaos with the traffic.,0
728, layout and craftsmanship are beautiful and magnificent.,1
729, We decide against the sunrise slot as the cold weather brings on a very heavy mist which doesn’t clear till about 8.,1
730,"We cannot but marvel at the Traffic system in the country for its ability to keep going against the odds – cycles,",1
731, It’s chaotic but it seems to work – even when people drive down the wrong side of the road.,0
732, It’s amazing that road rage isn’t prominent or the population of the country would reduce pretty rapidly.,1
733, There are some lovely views of the Taj in the distance which make great photo opportunities.,1
734,The sunset doesn’t seem too good and we are not sure where we could get a good view of this over the Taj so we head “home” to the Taj Plaza for a night in as we have to get up at 3.,1
735," Beautiful clear morning,",1
736, although his description of it being ‘beautiful and white’ slightly under-sells the visit!,1
737, The exterior is austere and overpowering compared to the simplicity and pure colour of the Taj but inside the fort holds great beauty and intricate design.,1
738, designed so the Emperors could sit during the warm summer months near to the water and the amazing views of the Taj from the royal balconies.,1
739, We all had time alone as the beauty of the sun setting silenced the moment.,1
740, through the very busy traffic of Agra.,0
741, Jerry and Joe had gone off to have some quiet time so it was a real mother daughter moment sitting with another mother who had a big heart.,1
742, The prodigious use of the horn and flashing lights (nobody dips headlights; always on full beam) would get you beaten up in UK.,0
743, with little crowd and much better ambiance.,1
744,Beat the noise today by waking up at 5AM and getting picked up by my driver (who only speaks broken English) at 6AM to avoid the Delhi morning traffic.,1
745, Dit bestond uit geroosterd brood met jam en een stapeltje biscuits en een paar hard gekookte eieren.,0
746, As much as I am enjoying the adventure I am also thoroughly missing my hills and mountains back home.,1
747, Only Rs250 per night for both of us (about $6 NZ) but having some sort of party and shouting kick off at 9pm and go till midnight while being eaten alive by sandflies and mosquitos AND having mild food poisoning was one I would rather just forget than 'put down to experience'.,1
748, Crossing into the lane of on-coming traffic to avoid the floats with the gods on them (Haviva says that was the moment she realized she wasn't in the US anymore).,1
749," A nerve-wracking walk through crowded streets,",0
750, partially because a whole crowd of people came down to the river carrying a body of a holy man.,0

770, a big open space with trees and a lake and lacking the noise of the city and horns.,1
771, incredibly peaceful paradise of rice paddies and lotus ponds.,1
772, I’d relax in a corner under a fan and devour various books on Buddhism.,1

774, the crowd would erupt into a mixture of applause and whooping.,1
775, We were going to experience the Taj at both sunrise and sunset to see its beauty from both angles.,1
776, I navigated around the building and ended up on the roof where the view was magical.,1
777, a bit more modest but a very lovely area to spend a quiet hour or so.,1
778, The garden is very peaceful with a large water basin in the middle.,1
779, the palace was pretty clean so being all philosophical just might work.,1
780, It’s moderately clean but the openings in the wall for the fan and under the door have allowed a few critters to get in.,0

787, They needed to clean my first one and prepare the second one.,0

792, crowded boats and looking out from windows.,0
793, I decided to cut short the ceremony like most of the crowd and headed back up the ghat.,0
794, The crowd was very dense and I couldn’t work myself a way through it until a cow came out of nowhere and pushed people out of its way.,0
795,I have been quiet yesterday because I was not in the mood to get out of the hotel.,0
796,After my last entry I had dinner on a tree top (I’m not kidding) with a nice view of the temples of Khajuraho and went to bed watching Wanted on Star Movies (That’s the only channel along with National Geographic that is in English).,1
797, I upgraded my usual hotel choice and took a nice shower in a clean bathroom.,1
798," it got crowded with pilgrims,",0
799, handicapped beggars hoping for some spiritual spirit and souvenir stalls selling crap and bottles to bring some holy water home.,0
800," I walked around the beautifully kept gardens,",1
801," When too big a crowd gathered around me,",0
802,"Beautiful monument and great at sunset,",1
803, Non-polluting vehicles have been introduced around the site to avoid pollution and preserved the Taj.,1
804, To be truthful visiting the Taj Mahal felt more like a chore than a real desire - until we encountered the beauty of this wonderous complex.,1
805, for some reason all the lights in my room cannot be turned off simultaneously and a power outage at 3:30 caused the noisy fan to stop turning.,0
806, Right before a busload of Chinese tourists came crowding the queuing area.,0
807, enjoying the views and making videos.,1

819, now polluting vehicles aren't allowed within a couple of hundred metres) was really enjoyable.,1
820,The crowds were not bad at all and as we entered we got a full panoramic view of the ghostly building.,1
821, Initially the light was not that strong making photos difficult as it is looks like an appartition but we took our time to take this initial view in and appreciate the scale of the place.,0
822," There are some really neat things about it's construction aside from its incredible beauty - the text that runs up to frame the door way does not look smaller the further away it is from you,",0
823, Aside from the classic shots across the gardens we were really interested in some other views and the details of the architecture.,1
824, After taking off we weaved our way throught he mountains until safely above them where we got tantalising glances of the snow capped peaks below through the clouds.,1
825, It is a different perspective driving through the chaos in a car and we are not that is entirely comfortable observing people eeking out a living behind a sheet of glass.,1
826, We had some kids persistantly beg with faces pressed against the car window as we were stuck in traffic for what seemed like eternity and our 'helpful' driver tells us things we already know because of course he wants a tip at the end.,1

855, stunning views and maybe a trek.,1
856, This hotel has a rooftop restaurant with a superb view of the Taj Mahal.,1
857, It was fortunate that I had taken a photo of this view yesterday as this morning it was very hazy and the Taj was almost lost in the mist.,1
858, The Taj Mahal is considered to be the most beautiful building in the world and I for one could not disagree.,1
859, Eventually we set off and the traffic was already starting to build up.,1
