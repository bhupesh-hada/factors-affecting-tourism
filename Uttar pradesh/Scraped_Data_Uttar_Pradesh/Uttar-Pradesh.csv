Varanasi
Tanta gente passa per Varanasi ogni anno: milioni di pellegrini arrivano per un bagno purificatore nel fiume Gange, migliaia di turisti stranieri vi cercano l'essenza della ""vera"" India, altri infine vi giungono semplicemente per morire; in queste poche righe cerchero' di spiegare come riuscire semplicemente a sopravviverci.

Il primo obiettivo e' naturalmente quello di non ammalarsi: strano a dirsi ma piu' ci ritorno e piu' capisco che non riusciro' mai a farmi gli anticorpi necessari per resistere all'attacco di quelle misteriose creature che popolano i cibi da strada (e non...), in grado di causarmi le piu' bizzarre e fastidiose reazioni corporee; probabilmente anche loro riescono a trarre dei benefici dalle acque del divino Gange, in grado di trasformarli e renderli praticamente invincibili. Non mi permetterei mai pero' di affermare che il fiume stesso possa essere la causa di tutti questi malori, sacrilegio! E comunque, lo sprovveduto turista, in caso di ""problemi"", potra' tranquillamente rifugiarsi in uno dei tanti ristoranti per stranieri ed iniziare una frustrante dieta a base di riso, patate, banane e brodi, cosi' triste in questo paese dalle infinite offerte culinarie.

Una volta risolto questo contrattempo, inizia la missione di cercare di non calpestare gli innumerevoli escrementi
Vacche del Gange
di vacca sparsi per le strade della citta' vecchia, la zona piu' a ridosso della sponda del fiume; facile a dirsi se non fossimo in un paese in cui questo animale riveste un ruolo di primo piano nel pantheon religioso locale; tori, bufali, vacche e vitelli si aggirano pacificamente indisturbati tra i vicoli, a volte talmente stretti da non permetterti il passaggio se non a serio rischio di beccarsi un'incornata: anche i locali ci vanno cauti. Il risultato e' un campo minato di stronzoni multiformi che attendono solamente di essere calpestati se non si presta la massima attenzione ai propri passi, dimenticandosi completamente di tutto cio' che ci sta attorno: sara' per questo che ancora fatico ad orientarmi tra questo labirinto di stradine buie e maleodoranti. Il risvolto positivo e' pero' dato dal valore intrinseco di questi rifiuti: vengono infatti accuratamente raccolti in grosse ceste, appallottolati e trasformati in grosse pizze che, dopo essere state essicate al sole, rappresentano una preziosa fonte di combustibile utilizzata nelle cucine piu' povere di tutta l'India. Anche il piscio di vacca, sebbene molto piu' difficile da raccogliere, non va completamente sprecato: nuovi risvolti nella medicina ayurvedica ne stanno ampiamente confermando le sue gia' da
Le sponde del Gange
tempo appurate qualita' mediche.

Puliti ed in buona salute, si deve ora affrontare una missione prettamente invernale: quella di resistere a delle temperature notturne che possono scendere anche a 4-5 gradi. Fondamentale, ma non scontata, e' una scorta di indumenti caldi (""ma va!, l'India e' un paese caldo!"") e l'accesso ad una fonte di acqua calda con cui poter compiere la abluzioni quotidiane; una coperta di lana verra' prontamente fornita dalla guest-house, ma di fonti alternative di riscaldamento nemmeno l'ombra. Per le strade i meno fortunati dovranno accontentarsi dei fuochi improvvisati con plastica e poche schegge di legno. Essendo a Varanasi, abbiamo comunque l'opzione di andare a girovagare lungo quelle sponde del Gange dove avvengono le cremazioni dei morti, i cui grossi falo' costituiscono una piacevole, sebbene macabra, fonte di apprezzato riscaldamento.

Come occupare allora le scarse ore di benessere trascorse in questa strana citta'? Di gran moda va il gioco degli aquiloni ma, avendo ormai raggiunto una certa eta', l'opzione piu' appropriata nel mio caso sarebbe quella dell'arte del volo dei piccioni. Molto piu' in voga, soprattutto tra gli stranieri di origine orientale, e' lo studio di uno strumento musicale tipico indico, tra cui alla grande vanno
La strada verso casa
il sitar, anche se con ovvi inconvenienti pratici dovuti alle sue dimensioni, e le tabla, un paio di piccoli tamburi dal magnifico suono ma che, se non attentamente maneggiati, possono trasformarsi in formidabili strumenti di tortura per le nostre delicate orecchie. Fortunatamente trovo un'alternativa nell'apprendimento (anche se con dubbi risultati) della lingua hindi, che mi terra' costantemente impegnato in queste corte, tristi giornate invernali nella grigia e nebbiosa Varanasi.
p.s. Ora, non fatevi delle brutte idee su di questa strana citta': sappiate che mentre scrivevo queste righe non ero, ovviamente, in buona salute e quindi I'll mio spirito potrebbe averne risentito....

Varanasi and the Ganges – Northern India

Having been captivated by this incredible country before, I jumped at the chance to return and explore further east; to experience the river on which more than a billion people depend – the Ganges. Over the coming weeks, my footprints will track from the teeming masses of Delhi to the pink city of Jaipur; marvel once again at the marble edifice of the Taj Mahal in Agra - all familiar locations now - and then onwards to new territory. But first I drag my butt out of bed at the crack of darkness and head to the airport. As much time as I spend at McCarran, I should have a parking space reserved with a golden plaque bearing my name.

Today’s itinerary has the first stop in Seattle – home of my favorite Delta Sky Lounge, where I’ll have a 3-hour layover before boarding yet another 777 to make the 11-hour flight to Paris….thank all the gods on high for lie flat beds in first class. With the assistance of a few cocktails, hopefully sleep won’t be too elusive – I still have a further 8+ hours of flight
DSCN0680
time on to Delhi from Paris, arriving close to midnight the following day.

The Seattle/Paris leg of my journey was a delight. Not only did I get to catch up on 4 new movie releases, but I also managed to get the multi-functional seat in just the right position for napping, which went a long way towards passing the tedious hours of flying and had me touching down in the French capital just before daybreak. The final leg on to Delhi was the hardest. I was brain-fried at this point and there wasn’t an area on my body that didn’t ache – such is the life of a road warrior. By the time we were crossing over the Caspian Sea in Central Asia I was able to doze off, and didn’t awaken until we were actually flying over the western end of the Himalayas (nope didn’t see Everest or K-2 unfortunately), and coming into land on the northern plains of India.

It’s a long hike from the jetway to immigration and thankfully only two other international flights landed around the same time. I was 4th in line to get my tourist visa and was shocked to find myself
DSCN0681
in baggage claim less than 20 minutes after touchdown – that must be a record for clearing Indian security – it took me 90 minutes on my last trip here. My driver was waiting just outside the Arrivals Hall and 45 minutes later, we were pulling up in front of the hotel.

For the first few days in India, I’ll be chilling out at the Doubletree Hotel and as they also have an executive lounge, no doubt I’ll be spending quite a bit of time there as well! It’s ideally situated close to the metro, so riding around Delhi to sightsee, should be a breeze.

A lovely surprise awaited me at check in – I expected to be upgraded, that’s standard for Hilton diamond members – but I didn’t expect to get a suite with a living room….this is taking being spoilt to a whole new level. It even has a dining table which seats 10 people, and the best part is the wrap-around glass windows with incredible views overlooking the entire neighborhood. It’s been a very long and tiring 2-day journey to get here. Now all I want to do is soak in the tub and climb
DSCN0682
into that beckoning king-size bed with lots of pillows – unpacking can wait until tomorrow, and so can everything else.

Mid-morning and time to check out the breakfast offerings up in the lounge, and as I’m in the exotic east and not North America, I’m going for the Asian choices in place of bacon and eggs. The chef was available and I asked for something different and tasty…..how’s this to start off the day? He is now my next best friend and I can’t wait to see what other choice cuisine selections he comes up with during my stay here.

The lounge is a bright and airy room with windows on three sides. I selected a table close to the west windows, so I can watch the morning sunlight creep across the landscape, as Delhi wakens to the new day. I’m looking forward to evening cocktails in here, as the views should be fabulous as night falls and the lights come on around the city. I have more than enough time to make friends with the staff - that always pays off. Once they are familiar with my preferences, drinks arrive at the table about the same time
DSCN0683
I do.

Interesting times here right now. On November 8, the country began “demonetization” (is that even a word?) whereby all existing 500 and 1000 rupee notes were recalled, are no longer considered legal currency, and have to be exchanged for new notes. To add to this chaos, banks and ATMS are only allowed to exchange these old notes for new, up to a maximum of 2,500 rupees per day (approximately $41) with resulting extremely long lines outside both every day. I even read in this morning’s newspaper that one old guy died, after standing in line for 3 straight days! How nuts is that? I have some local currency with me left over from the last visit – thankfully all in lower denominations, so still spendable (for now). This place is a hoot.

A symbol of the country’s rich past and thriving present, Delhi is a city where ancient and modern blend seamlessly together. It is a place that not only touches your pulse, but hastens it to a frenetic speed. Just a century ago, the British moved the seat of their empire from Kolkata to Delhi, and it has been the capital of India ever since.
DSCN0684
Now a thriving, cosmopolitan metropolis, the city has much to celebrate as it has already reached the milestone of completing 100 years as a capital. With a history that goes back many centuries, Delhi showcases an ancient culture and a rapidly modernizing country. Dotted with monuments, there is much to discover here. The seat of many powerful empires in the past, its long history can be traced in its many carefully-preserved monuments, ancient forts and tombs.

All this is combined with the best features of a modern city such as a metro system, bustling markets and fabulous eating places. The past and the present meld seamlessly together, making centuries-old monuments a part of the city’s daily life. Delhi is very much a history’s child. The story of the city is as old as the epic Mahabharata. Many empires rose to the heights of their power and were destroyed here. Among the prominent dynasties which made Delhi their capital were the Tughlaqs, the Khiljis and the Mughals.

Even today, it’s easy to catch a fascinating glimpse into the past in Old Delhi, with its labyrinth of narrow lanes, old havelis, and colorful bazaars. Rickshaws wind their way through this
DSCN0685
crowded, bustling capital of the Mughals, where life continues much as it did hundreds of years ago. It is home to three World Heritage monuments—Qutub Minar, Red Fort and Humayun’s Tomb that have survived many centuries, and give an idea of architectural wonders created by emperors in the past. Central Delhi, with its tree-lined avenues, imposing structures and buildings such as the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament House and India Gate, reflect Delhi’s colonial past. But modern Delhi has a lot more to offer. Delhi has a modern, well-planned and extensive Metro network that connects all corners of the city; this network is still growing. New roadways and flyovers have improved connectivity, the latest of which is the Signature Bridge, an ambitious project of Delhi Tourism.

New malls and entertainment centers jostle for space with a growing number of brand new hospitals, residential complexes, and sporting facilities. Delhi is now a dream destination for those seeking expert medical attention. Thanks to the advent of the Commonwealth Games, there are world-class stadiums like the revamped Nehru Stadium that can be accessed throughout the year. All of this has been developed and sustained while maintaining Delhi’s green cover, a unique feature that distinguishes
DSCN0686
this truly global metropolis from other cities in the world, where tree lines are subdued by skyscrapers.

Besides the Metro, the new, fun way to explore is by riding the Hop on/Hop off bus, better known as HOHOs. As many of you know, this has always been my most favorite way to explore a city, and it’s always first on my list of things to do after arrival. A 2-day unlimited use ticket is only $20 and makes 22 stops between the red and the green lines. Now I just have to figure out where the closest bus stop is to the Doubletree.

Delhi has tourist sites and monuments galore, but probably one of the most impressive is the Red Fort. Converted into a barracks by the British, this massive fort is a sandstone carcass of its former self, but it still conjures a picture of the splendor of Mughal Delhi. Protected by dramatic 54’ high walls, the marble and sandstone monuments here were constructed at the peak of the dynasty’s power, when the empire was flush with gold and precious stones. Shah Jahan founded the fortress between 1638 and 1648 to protect his new capital city of
DSCN0687
Shahjahanabad, but he never took up full residence, after his disloyal son Aurangzeb imprisoned him in Agra Fort.

The last Mughal emperor of Delhi, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was driven from the Red Fort in 1857 and exiled to Burma (Myanmar) for his role in the First War of Independence. The new conquerors cleared out most of the buildings inside the fortress walls and replaced them with ugly barrack blocks for the colonial army. Every evening except Monday, the fort is the setting for a bombastic sound and light show, with colored spotlights and a portentous voiceover, highlighting key events in the history of the Red Fort. Haven’t decided which night this week I’m attending this, but I won’t be missing it that’s for sure.

Second evening in town found me up in the lounge sipping a delicious white wine and watching the array of lights spring to life around the neighborhood. The pollution is so bad here, it’s like looking thru a layer of Vaseline – everything is blurred and fuzzy – not to mention how bad it smells at times, but nothing detracts from the exotic feel of the Indian landscape. The lounge hostess came over with
DSCN0688
an invite to a private cocktail tasting event down in the Spiritual Bar on the lobby floor, which was being held for the next hour. Sounded like something I could get into, so off I went. Had a great time and was certainly feeling no pain by the time I staggered back to my suite on the 11th floor. No doubt I’m in for a fantastic stay here.

I spent the next week roaming from Delhi to Jaipur and on to the home of the Taj Mahal in Agra. As I have written extensively about these cities previously, I’ll skip ahead. Once in Agra, checked into the fabulous Jaypee Palace Hotel for a couple of nights, before beginning the “new territory” part of this entire trip, in a couple of days. This city is the majesty of the Taj and its magical allure draws tourists to the site like moths to a flame. No matter how many times you view photographs or watch travel shows about the Taj, nothing compares to standing in front of this magnificent monument and having your breath stolen away in awe. I would consider it a “once in a lifetime” experience and no doubt,
DSCN0689
it is exactly that for millions.

Leaving Agra bright and early on Monday morning, today was the start of all new territory for me and it begins with a ride on a genuine Indian train. Arriving at the station, I was greeted by the usual mass of humanity but what struck me most, was the grotesque deformities of a number of beggars surrounding the main entrance. Some had feet missing, others twisted arms and missing fingers, but the one which made me stop and think, was a man seated in a tricycle with feet probably 5 times normal size. They reminded me of clown shoes with massive swollen toes and as he had stick-thin legs, the appendages appeared even larger. Some of these deformities are probably self-inflicted to generate income, but it’s very hard to comprehend mutilating your body in this fashion just to beg for funds. Beggars are to be found all over the station and totally ignoring them is the only way. Wearing sunglasses is a great help – they can’t tell if you see them or not.

Tickets for the ride to Jhansi have assigned seat numbers when selecting the first class, air conditioned coach
DSCN0690
but I soon found out, these are suggestions not absolutes. Trains stop in stations from 1 minute to 8 – thankfully Agra qualified for the maximum 8 minutes which was definitely needed! Organized chaos ensued with people grabbing whatever seats were available and to hell with reservations….I had to laugh….it’s SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO India. I ended up with a window seat in a row of 3. Didn’t do me any good. The windows are so filthy the outside world is a blur, but such is life, right? LOL. A couple of hours later we pull into Jhansi where my 4-hour bus ride is waiting to transport me to the next port of call: Khajuraho, home of the world-famous exotic carvings.

This was a pretty boring drive thru endless fields under agriculture, but there was one highlight. The bus came to a sudden halt in the middle of nowhere, and villagers were hacking down a monstrous Eucalyptus tree at the side of the road, and of course, they were having it drop right across the highway! Is this a great country or what? Using basic axes, they had it down in a few minutes but it took another 40 for them to
DSCN0691
remove enough branches to be able to pull the entire trunk out of the road so we could continue our journey. What a riot. As a result, I arrived at my next hotel, the Radisson, well after dark and completely exhausted. This has been one incredibly long day of travel.

A Little Bit of History:

Early next morning, I get to spend a few hours wandering around the marvelous monument site. The Khajuraho Temples in Madhya Pradesh are amongst the most beautiful medieval monuments in India. Originally a group of 85, they are the largest group of Hindu and Jain temples in the world, although only about 25 of them remain today. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, they have awed generations of people with their architectural brilliance, intricate carvings and most famously, their erotic sculptures. They were built by the Chandella rulers between 900 and 1130 AD, during the golden period of the Chandella dynasty. It is presumed that every Chandella ruler built at least one temple in his lifetime. One noteworthy ruler was Maharaja Rao Vidyadhara, who repelled the attacks of Mahmud of Ghazni. His love for sculptures is shown in these temples. Khajuraho which is located
DSCN0692
right in the heart of Central India,and is believed to be the religious capital of Chandellas. The Chandella rulers had tried to distinguish politics from religious and cultural activities by establishing their political capital in Mahoba, making Khajuraho a religious and cultural capital. The first recorded mention of the Khajuraho temples is in the accounts of Al-Biruni in 1022 AD and in the works of the Arab traveler Ibn Battuta in 1335 AD.

These temples, scattered over an area of about 9 square miles, depict the traditional lifestyle of women in the medieval age. Rediscovered almost nine centuries later, they give a poignant representation of life in the 11th century. A few of the temples are dedicated to the Jain pantheon and the rest to Hindu deities. The divine sculptures are a tribute to life itself, embodying everything that is sublime and spontaneous about it. Built using sandstone with varying shades of buff, pink and pale yellow, each contains an entrance, a hall, a vestibule and a sanctum. The inside of the temple has rooms that are inter-connected and placed on an East/West line and constructed with spiral superstructures.

The images of Goddesses and Gods sculpted on the
DSCN0693
temple walls represent the many manifestations of the divine Shakti and Shiva, the female and male principles, the Yin and the Yang. These temples are mainly associated with their erotic art, especially the western Devi Jagdambi Temple, located next to the Kandariya Mahadeva temple. It has rows of sculptures depicting divinities and explicit erotic sculptures, especially those depicting mithunas in sexual positions. It is because of these erotic sculptures that these are also known as the Kama Sutra temples. Most of the erotic sculptures can be found either on the outside or inner walls of the temples but not near the deities. However, it is a common misconception that the sculptures show lovemaking between deities. In fact, they actually show passionate interactions between humans along with changes that occur in the human bodies. It is also believed that these temples are a celebration of womanhood, as they depict sculptures of heavily ornamented, broad-hipped and busty, well-proportionate women adorning the temple walls. The well contoured bodies of the nymphs grab attention and they can be seen engaging in activities like putting on make-up, washing their hair, playing games and knotting and unknotting their girdles.

Another belief of these erotic sculptures,
DSCN0694
amongst them nymphs with their sensuous poses and pouting expressions, are a way of giving importance to wellbeing and love of life. During the medieval era there was a common belief that having erotic sculptures and decorative motifs was protective and auspicious. According to legend goblins, creepers and erotic sculptures were meant to be carved on the temple door to bring good luck. This was linked to the idea of young boys during the medieval era practicing ‘brahmacharya’, in which they were required to live in hermitage until they matured and became adult men, thus these sculptures are said to have been made to prepare them for the worldly desires and learn about them. Sounds like early Playboy magazine reading to me. The erotic art at Khajuraho is considered to represent the pinnacle of love and passion. However, during the period between 900 and 1300 AD most Hindu, Jain and Buddhist temples across western and southern India featured some form of erotic art.

This was a short whistle-stop before boarding the Jet Airways flight in the midafternoon to my final India destination, Varanasi and the world-famous holy river. Checked into yet another Radisson Hotel and prepared for the evening’s
DSCN0695
entertainment – this is what I came here to see and experience – Hindu cremations along the banks of this incredible waterway.

A Little Bit of History:

The River Ganges, also known as the Ganga, flows 2,000 miles from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal in northern India and Bangladesh. Regarded as sacred by Hindus, the river is personified as the goddessGanga in ancient texts and art. Ritual bathing in the Ganges was and is an important part of Hindu pilgrimage, and the ashes of the cremated are often spread across her waters. Described in the Mahabharataas the 'best of rivers, born of all the sacred waters', the Ganges is considered a tirtha, which means a crossing point between heaven and earth.

Situated on the west bank of the Ganges River in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi is India’s oldest city and thought to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Mark Twain, upon visiting in the 1890s, quipped that it’s “older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together!” Varanasi is also the religious capital of India
DSCN0696
and Hinduism. Millions of Hindus want to die, or at least have their ashes spread, in the Ganges here. In doing so, they believe they can break the perpetual cycle of samsara, of birth and rebirth, and thus achieve moksha, eternal liberation.

That’s why dead bodies are burning 24 hours a day, seven days a week. “This same fire has been going for 3,000 years,” said a worker at Manikarnika Ghat, the most famous riverside cremation site in Varanasi. “We average anywhere from 30 to 100 bodies per day. Each takes about three hours.” The corpses are covered in ghee (clarified butter), laid atop wooden planks, layered with ornate cloth, briefly dipped in the Ganges and then carried to the open-air pit and lit aflame.

Death is big business here. There are hotels that accept only occupants expected to die within 15 days (thankfully not part of the Hilton chain), and according to Uttar Pradesh’s official data, tourism is on the rise with thousands coming every month to watch this theater of death along the Ganges. And while workers at Manikarnika Ghat will tell you that families can pay “based on means,” there is immense pressure to buy
DSCN0697
the right kind of wood for these cremations (sandalwood for example, offers a better burn and therefore it is believed, means a better shot at moksha). In the end, a body can cost a family 7,000 Indian rupees ($105) to burn, over 15 percent of the average Indian’s yearly wage. It’s why many families deposit their recently deceased directly into the Ganges or into a channel that will lead to it. Liberating the soul of a loved one is worth running the risk that the body ends up being picked apart by carrion birds and wild dogs. The problem really is when the scavenging animals don’t come, and the bodies are left to rot in the river. You gotta love a city which thrives on death – somewhat akin to Las Vegas which can feel the same way on weekends, when the locust swarms of tourists arrive. Too bad we can’t dump tourists into the Colorado River from Hoover Dam!

Just before 5pm, the bus left the hotel and during the 30-minute drive to the river’s edge, I got to experience yet another typically Indian event, the transportation of actual dead bodies tied to the top of 4x4 Land
DSCN0698
Rovers. Apparently, this is handled routinely by a local company who never carry live passengers only the dead, on their way to cremation and having their ashes scattered over the holy waters. Not a single head turned as this vehicle careened down the highway – only those of us on the bus had any reaction to the spectacle.

It was after dark by the time we arrived at the landing where we boarded a large wooden motor boat in which we would spend the next couple of hours cruising the river. The pollution is so bad here, we were all wearing disposable masks. The combination of heavy smoke from the cremation fires, the existing air pollution and incense being burned, covers the entire city with a blanket of smog which burns the eyes, nose and throat – it’s worse than Delhi, Bejing and Cairo all rolled together! But in spite of this miserable atmosphere, the next two hours were something I will never forget.

A number of other boats were slowly cruising in the same direction and in spite of the sputtering sound of the engines, it was a surreal scene – something out of the Twilight Zone.
DSCN0699
Bright spots of light appeared in the distance – we were approaching the actual cremation site along the river bank. These bright spots were 12 fires already consuming bodies with smoke spiraling into the murky sky. A mass of people (probably friends and relatives of the deceased) surrounded each funeral pyre and the flames climbed higher and higher as additional logs were added. A couple of bodies right at the water’s edge were awaiting cremation, covered in red and yellow shrouds – it reminded me of a scene out of Dante’s Inferno – a sight to never be forgotten, that’s for sure.

After about 15 minutes, we started moving again and next up we were greeted with lights, sound, chanting and bells coming from the Aarti Ceremony, also along the water’s edge. This is the exact opposite of the cremation scene, it’s a celebration of life with new priests taking center stage. Here we were part of a massive audience. There must have been over a hundred boats, each with at least a dozen people on board, all enjoying this incredible sight. Hundreds more lined each side of the raised stages on land, wouldn’t surprise me if there were
DSCN0700
4,000 or more, all witnessing this incredible event. Seven priests performed intricate moves all involving fire in various containers; clouds of incense swirled around their heads and along with their singing and chiming of bells, made for a wild scene. We stayed here for about an hour before finally turning around and heading back to our departure point. What an incredible evening I had – certainly a once-in-a-lifetime event for me.

saddhus in Vrindavan
We left Jaipur early in the morning. At 9.30 am we had to be at Delhi Airport to pick up our luggage. We arrived perfectly on time and even had time for a roadside breakfast and a chai. Once at the airport our first challenge: we had to call the service desk to tell them to bring out the luggage as we were not allowed to enter the airport without a ticket. So we went to different service desks outside the airport to ask if someone could make a call for us (we even offered them to pay for the call). But they all gave us the same answer: during work they are not allowed to make phone calls and they do not have a phone for that. Finally we ended up on one end of the airport where we could enter a seperate parte with desks to buy tickets of all major airlines. And here we were successful. We could talk to the service desk, then go to the other end of the airport and wait. We waited the 5 indian minutes they told us to wait (which were about 20 ""real"" minutes) - and then, you cannot imagine the
enjoying a chai
relieve when both our backpacks appeared! Happily we received the luggage and then even discovered an ATM which gave out cash. The queue was not to long, but unfortunately only debit cards (which we do not have) and local indian cards were working. So no cash for us.

We have read a lot of comments also here on travelblog that the cash situation is not so bad in India. Believe us, we have been to India before and what we as low budget travellers encountered at that time was terrible. Maybe the situation has improved in the meantime. And yes, it is one possibility to book everything online (accomodation, traintickets, and so on). But booking online makes it more expensive. Walk in guests in India always get discounts and much nicer rooms! By booking transport tickets online, you loose flexibility (and this is not our way of travelling, esp. not in India). And the queues were mainly terribly long. There sometimes were riots. We have heard of murders (luckily haven't seen anything like this) and injuries of people waiting for ATMs. The presence of police and security stuff was immense and necessary. In areas away from the tourist route
buying some natural oils
it was simply impossible to get cash - just for a very high commission from private ""dealers"". In Goa it was easier, that is true. Even there, lots of shops are already closing down because people do not spend cash on buying things .However, we met many backpackers who gave up and left the country because the situation was not bearable. One couple was in Mumbai without cash for 2 weeks! We met them in Jaipur where they celebrated the 2000 Rupees each they got cash for the first time! So, all travellers who now have no or few problems: you are lucky! Enjoy it!

Back to our trip. After receiving the luggage, we got notice that our friends (all devotees of our spiritual master Paramahamsa Sri Swamin Vishwananda) had already landed. So we were waiting for them to get out of the airport. It took them 3 hours from landing to passing the passport control and getting cash at the money exchange to coming out. We patiently waited and were all very happy to meet! With them we could share the bus to our next destination Vrindavan. So, the rest of the blog will rather be a bit
procession around Vrindavan
spiritual - but this is part of our life in the meantime. We know that a lot of people might think ""they are crazy"" - we don't care. We love it this way - we have had the other life before, it led us into big troubles and health problems. This now leads us to happiness, to a long lasting happiness and not the short term happiness of the materialistic society.

We all were extremely excited to arrive there. Paramahamsa Vishwananda was inaugurating the new Bhakti Marga Shram and Temple, the Sri Giridhar Dham. And we had his grace to join him for this once-in-a-lifetime experience. Vrindavan is the holiest place on earth. And we were allowed to join our guru there for the inauguration of the temple. Our minds simply cannot understand or caputer what this means. It is just a huge gift. Around 2.000 people came together from all over the world to this event. But let me tell you a bit more about what we did and how the days were like.

The day we arrived we all settled down in our rooms, got organized (especially as we just got our luggage after 4 days)
Paramahamsa Vishwananda during the inauguration of the temple
and then had a satsang with the spiritual head of Paramahamsa Vishwananda in Switzerland, Swamini VishwaKishori Ma. She has the blessing of our master to guide us in Switzerland and gathered together the whole swiss group (about 25 people). At a satsang, a spiritual person is answering questions and telling stories about spiritual topics. After, we walked around the area of the ISCON Temple in Vrindavan and enjoyed some chai tea, of course. Even walking around Vrindavan, the holy city of Krishna, is considered to be a blessing and burning karma. The next day the swiss group walked part of the parikrama of Vrindavan (parikrama is a walk around a holy place), we visited Kaliya Ghat and the famous Bhanke Bihari Temple. We were all wearing our thilak (this is a sign on your forehead which shows the lineage in hinduism to which you belong), so really everyone recognised us as devotees of Paramahamsa Vishwananda or, if not, asked us and gave us the possibility to talk about our master. That was a very nice experience as the people mainly were really interested and open. For the afternoon we spontanously got an invitation of our master to do Hari Naam
on the bus from Delhi to Vrindavan
together. So we went to the new Bhakti Marga Temple. The Temple is beautiful. Paramahamsa Vishwananda welcomed us and all together we did a procession in the streets of Vrindavan. We were singing, walking and dancing - it was wonderful. People on the side of the streets were watching us. Our joy and happiness was infectuous and many locals joined in or had at least big smiles on their faces. In the evening we even could join in for puja, abishekam and aarti in the temple. This was not on the programm and most of the participants had not even arrived. It was like a special blessing for the about 300 people who were already there.

The next 3 days were simply filled with different ceremonies for the inauguration of the temple. As only few people could be inside the temple, there was a constant change so that everyone got time to be inside. Paramahamsa Vishwananda was doing the ceremonies, welcoming guests and blessing us all the days! It was amazing. Our narrow mind can only understand a fracture of what was happening there. We can observe what happened on the outside. But we all could feel that something
Satsang with Swamini VishwaKishori Ma from Switzerland
very special was happening as well inside of us and in the atmosphere. We, both have no idea what this is, but it was wonderful and we could feel that it was special. We got so many blessings! It was heart opening, making you happy and light. We lost our hearts in Vrindavan.....

And what happened ""on the outside""? 300 saddhus from Vrindavan were invited on the first day. They got prasad personally from our master. Different holy people and saints came to pay their respect to our Gurudev. There was a big yagya (fire ceremony) and a Maha-Abishekam. The main deities are Krishan and Yamuna Maharani. In fact, the Sri Giridhar Temple of Paramahamsa Vishwananda is the first temple in the world having Yamuna as the main deity. Every night in a big tent next to the ashram there was bhajan singing and dancing with Paramahamsa Vishwananda. On the last day of the inauguration, Sri Binod Biharidas, a saint who is living in Barsane (the birthplace of Radha) came to visit the Temple and our master. This was the most touching moment we have every experienced. Sri Binod Biharidas has never left Barsane so far. It was the
me during satsang
first time he left his place. And he visited Paramahamsa Vishwananda. I, Nina, was inside the temple when he came in. Our master even offered him his seat (normally, the guru seat is only for the guru). For me, it was nearly impossible to breathe. I just had tears in my eyes. No more details on this.

We both are so thankful that we could be part of such an event in such a place with Paramahamsa Vishwananda. It is unbelievable! After he left Vrindavan in the morning, we had some private time left in Vrindavan before we drove back to Delhi to catch our flight to our next destination. We needed some quiet time to be able to comprehend at least a little bit what had happened in the 6 days in Vrindavan.

If you have questions about Paramahamsa Vishwananda (any kind of questions), feel free to contact us at any time. You can also send us a private message via our website .

By the way: we did not make any pictures during the ceremonies as we wanted to fully absorb it without distraction. So, mainly, the pictures are from Bhakti Marga, the organisation of
the stealer of glasses - monkeys in Vrindavan always steal you glasses!

Coral tree homestay.
It was such a colourful building and I loved sitting in the gardens.
Day twenty two was not such an early morning, we had curry and strange fried bread 'doughnuts' for breakfast then met our driver and headed back towards Jaipur along our favourite bumpy roads. Playing I-spy kept us occupied and stopping at a little way station we bought some supplies and fed some Pringles to a dog who clearly had puppies. Everywhere we bumped into children they always got so excited to see us, calling out 'hello' and waving frantically.

We took the car directly to the train station, stopping along the way to try and find a cash point with no success. With only a small delay we hopped on the train towards Agra. The sleeper carriages in India are very different to those in Vietnam, there are six beds with two tiers in each area - one perpendicular to the other two and on the other side of the corridor. You can close curtains in front of your bed for privacy but there are no doors, and people walk up and down the corridor selling all sorts of things like noodles, samosas, pakoras, crisps and chai. All vegetarian which suited me very well!

It was only a four

hour journey and it flew by, we had been warned to watch out for people in Agra station as, being the home of the Taj Mahal, it is a major tourist destination and so lots of people are waiting to try and scam you in some way or other. However it was surprisingly easy and we met our driver outside with no hassle. He just about fit all our luggage into the boot and we had only a short drive until we got to the hotel.

The hotel 'Coral Tree Homestay' has to be one of my favourites so far. We entered from a dusty side street through a tall gate and into a candlelit garden space full of plants and trees and little tables dotted around. It was family owned and for dinner that evening we sat in the family's dining room and ate beautiful home cooked (and vegetarian!) food with some of the other guests. I loved the room; the walls were painted in bright colours and the bedding was decorated all over with elephants.

The Money Shot
Managed to get a reflection off the water too. This shot was surprisingly easy to take as tourists cannot walk by the watercourse.
So. It was time for my first train ride in India. But first, I had to get to the main train station in Delhi.

On the Delhi metro, all bags have to be scanned and all passengers have to be patted down airport style because of security fears. It is usually pretty efficient but with my backpack this time, it wasn't. Basically it was too big to fit through the scanning machine and rather being nice and waving me through - it's not like I look like or am a terrorist - the security guard insisted I couldn't take it onto the metro. Annoyed, I then had to take a tuk-tuk to the station and I really didn't think about the price I got quoted and realised halfway into the journey that I was ripped off by about 80-100 rupees. Sure, the ride was just £2.50 but I now only have £10 left to spend for the day! Bloody backpacker's budget.
At the train station, utter chaos. It was probably a normal day, as me and my luggage squeezed through the crowds to the platform furthest away from the entrance. On board the train, my bag wouldn't squeeze under the

seat and again I was left thinking I should've brought a smaller bag despite having travelled with mine for over a year now. And it was quite possibly the most antiquated train I have ever taken. With bars on the windows, it looked like prison transport. Old prison transport. Suddenly I was pining for Swiss trains, despite their price. But in truth, I was rather excited about this train ride - this is real travelling, I told myself. A family of locals shared my open cabin with me, the mother changing her baby's nappy right in front of everyone.
Like on the cheaper buses in Latin America, beggars and sellers do their rounds on an Indian train. I had my first cup of chai in India on-board - it was delicious! Like milk tea mixed with cinnamon, maybe cumin and lots of sugar.
Outside, we pass the rail side slums of outer Delhi. With the exception of the ones I saw out the window just outside of Cape Town, these were perhaps the poorest I have seen. Improvised brick buildings, corrugated iron roofs, rubbish strewn everywhere.

Politeness and courtesy aren't things here. People will often just do things involving you or your stuff without

asking and use curt orders when they want something from you. They don't seem to know how to ask for anything nicely. The lady sat next to me wanted my window seat so she could eat. Can you not eat where you're sitting now? Not wanting to cause a fuss, I swap seats. I've also had trouble understanding some of the locals and their accents, especially if their English isn't great. I don't understand any Hindi apart from when they put in English words into the middle of Hindi conversations, which is really often. I have also noticed that the word for ""no"" in Hindi is ""ney"" - the same as in Dutch, funnily enough (""nej"" in Dutch).

Our train left about 45 minutes late and constantly stopped in the middle of nowhere. I ended up arriving about two hours after I was supposed to. I'm guessing this is just Indian trains for you and I now realised why so many people were camped out on the train platforms.
I got an honest tuk-tuk driver for once and as well as charging me the right fare to the hostel, he also gave me tips about getting into the Taj

Mahal. He was hoping I'd agree to an all day tour the next day but at least he wasn't ripping me off.

Here in this most touristy of cities, I noticed food was more expensive and served Western style with curry in separate dishes along with the rice and bread that you ordered on the side. I missed my ₹60 thali in Delhi. The puri I had for breakfast the next morning however was delicious and may even have been the best thing I have eaten in India so far - even if it was ₹100.
And I do have to say that the highlight of India so far has been the food. Pretty much everything I have tried has been delicious and I have been eating curry literally every day. In saying that though, skipping lunch means that I am always starving when I have eaten, which might make things taste nicer than it is! But seriously, I have absolutely been loving the food over here - even better when it's ridiculously cheap!

My dorm mates went to the Taj for sunrise - I've done a few sunrises and to be honest, I never think that it's

really worth it. It's probably because I'm not a massive fan of sunrises and sunsets. And anyway, a sunset is pretty much the same as a sunrise except that you don't have to get up early innit.
And so that is how I timed my arrival at one of the new wonders of the world. There is usually a giddy sense of excitement and anticipation before seeing a famous sight and the Taj Mahal was no different. And then through the main gate, it's there.
And it is a magnificent sight.
Half of it is the setting - the wonderfully manicured gardens, the fact that there is nothing around it, the raised platform giving it pride of place, the symmetrical waterways that perfectly reflect the mausoleum. The other half of it is the size and grandeur of the mausoleum, even though I thought that it might be bigger. It's just massive. Something like the duomo in Milan or St Peter's Cathedral would be a comparable. The story behind it is a romantic one too; an emperor so heartbroken by the death of his mistress, that he built such a thing in her memory. Already huge by modern standards, this must've been something otherworldly during

the time it was built.

The building has been wonderfully maintained, the white marble still clean and smooth, considering it was built in 1653. There are some intricate carvings on its exterior but it was the size and symmetry that struck me the most. You can't take photos inside the mausoleum, not that there is much to take. It is dark and not particularly interesting. The two red sandstone buildings that flank the Taj would probably have been spectacular sights in themselves had they not been literally overshadowed by the Taj.

Literally at the end of the day as the sun set on the Taj - this ethereal presence in the fading light at the end of a heavenly waterway - one last look before I left confirmed why it has been described as ""a teardrop on the cheek of eternity"".

Taj Mahal reflected
Geo: 26.9847, 78.1019

We left Jaipur at 8am on Sunday morning. We had over 200kms to travel to our next stop, Agra. It was another clear sunny, warm day and the traffic was not so busy. The trip would prove to be far easier and more relaxing than the previous one.

Our driver first stopped about two hours into the journey at a local Hindu Temple. We all spent about 20 minutes exploring this place. It was very colourful with many worshippers, mainly women and children, paying homage to the gods. They seemed to be making offerings of puffed rice and small white flowers. They walked around the altar in a clockwise direction several times and then sat down. They were very welcoming and the children gathered around us waving and saying ""Bye-bye.""

From there we travelled onwards on reasonable roads, stopping at Toll Gates. The villages we passed through were busy with many families parading in their most colourful saris and outfits. The trucks were numerous, parked at the laybys and in front of the small food stalls. About 1pm we stopped at a Hotel for lunch. This was a modern place but built in traditional style. We went upstairs to a large
Entrance gate to the Taj
dining-room where the now familiar buffet awaited us. The main meat dish here was Tandoori chicken with several vegetable dishes and the usual rice and daal. Tasty and filling washed down with the Kingfisher beer.

The villages here seemed to specialise in their products. One had numerous places selling sandstone pottery creations including carved animals and temple decorations. We stopped at one for a look. The next had numerous brick kilns, their towers rising high into the air. It probably has to do with the location of materials for these things.

Our next major stop was at the fort called Fatehpur Sikri or City of Victory. This was built by Akbar, the grandfather of Shah Jahn who built the Taj Mahal. This is a red sandstone fort which is about 40km from Agra. We had to leave the bus at the bottom of the hillside and then ride in the government bus which cost 40 rupees for the two way trip. Once at the top we disembarked and our local guide, Ali, took us through the large gates and into the complex. Within the high walls, including a 55 metre gate, lay several buildings, one of which is a marble tomb for
I'm actually at the Taj Mahal
the Sufi saint, Salim, who blessed Akbar and prophesied that a son would be born soon. When this happened Akbar built the city in thanks. We had to take off our shoes and the red sandstone was very hot underfoot. The marble, however, was cool and welcoming. Inside the marble building was the tomb and if you bought a piece of cloth and flowers you could tie a thread to the screens and make a wish which was sure to come true. I didn't bother.

We then walked to the Mosque which is open-air like in Delhi and very similar in decoration and style. We were hounded by mostly children whom we tried to ignore, trying to sell us various goods. We walked through the huge main gate and admired the view out over the valley then a walk back around the cloisters to the front entrance. It was an interesting stop and the architecture is grand and detailed but the annoying hawkers rather spoiled the atmosphere.

Our final leg took us into the city. The road got worse as we came closer and the traffic, heavier. We crawled through a narrow market area teeming with people, motorbikes and cars and finally
The Mosque next to the Taj
arrived at our Hotel, Clark Shiraz. This is a 5 star complex, set in large and attractive gardens. We were met by our local agent and assigned rooms. We were told that tomorrow morning we needed to leave for the Taj Mahal at 5-45am to be there for sunrise and to beat the crowds. We spent the evening pleasantly, having a drink with our fellow travellers and then dinner in the Buffet of the hotel but an early night was needed.

The alarm awoke us at 5am and we were in the lobby by 5-35. It was only a short trip in the dark to the Taj. From where the bus dropped us it was a 500 metre walk along a brick paved road as the sky gradually lightened. There were many others walking the same path. Our guide, Atul, bought us tickets which included a free bottle of water and we were then herded into what looked like cattle runs, women on one side and men on the other, to pass through security and be frisked. The gates were open at 6-20am and we shuffled forward and pushed and were jostled until we reached the security lady who quickly brushed
Outsde the mosque
us down and we passed through.

We walked through another entrance gate through which we could see the outline of this iconic building and then emerged into the now growing daylight to see the edifice in all its majestic glory. As the sun rose the white marble glowed and subtly changed colours. Atul introduced us to an official photographer who came with us and took photos of the group and individual couples which would be waiting for us after our visit. Then Atul launched into the story behind the building of the Taj. By this time it was nearly 7-15 and several of us were impatient to get going so we agreed on a time to meet again and we set off on our own to explore. The gardens surrounding the building are peaceful and even though there were many people there it did not feel crowded. No hawkers inside was a blessing. We climbed up onto the marble platform about half way and took photos including ones with the reflection in the water channel in front. Then it was onto the main building itself. The closer we approached, the more beautiful it became as we were able to see the
Monkeying around
exquisite detail of the decorations.

We put covers on our shoes and walked up the steps to the entrance. The view back to the entrance was grand and up close the walls of the Taj gleamed white. The colours of the inlays all done using semi-precious stones glowed in the morning light. The flower panels carved into the marble were all unique, each different but perfect in design. We went into the mausoleum to see where Shah Jahn's wife, Mumtaz Mahal was buried. She died in childbirth, delivering her 14th child in 18 years!! Shah Jahn was devastated and hence built this amazing structure. He lies next to her having died 35 years later. Inside was unlit except for a single silver lamp in the centre. The darkness and the closeness with so many people vying to see the coffins was stifling. We walked all round this central room and saw the stone coffins lying side by side decorated beautifully.

Outside of this inner chamber we could walk around another passage lined with screened windows. We emerged into the now bright sunshine. On either side of the Taj are two similar buildings each facing the other built in the red sandstone so
Beautiful Taj
favoured elsewhere. Looking at the Taj the one on the left is a mosque and I am not sure of the purpose of the other. The river runs across the back of the complex and we walked around the outside and explored both buildings. We were amused watching the monkeys playing on the scaffolding of the eastern side which is being cleaned.

From there we slowly walked back to the meeting place and the rest of the group gathered there at 8-30. Then it was time to leave this magic place and return to the hotel for breakfast. Our photos turned out so well we bought all of them.

We left the hotel again at 10-30 and our first stop was at a stone cutting workshop where they use the time honoured methods seen in the decoration of the Taj. We were shown how they do the inlays and then taken to the shop where we eventually bought a beautiful marble plate with a traditional design.

From there we drove to the Agra Fort. This is another of the red sandstone buildings built by the Moghul emperors. This one was started by Akbar in 1565. We entered through the main gate, Amar Singh.
Stone worker
As we walked up Atul pointed out the slits in the walls for cannon,archers and boiling oil. It is surrounded by a moat which was filled with crocodiles. As we walked in we were shown the areas where the elephants would have been kept and the long entrance pathway which was an extra security element. This fort had two functions, It was a palace for Akbar and his descendants and a military stronghold. The British took it over in the late 19th century and now the Indian Army occupies over half of it.

The section we saw was the marble buildings constructed by Shah Jahn for himself, his wife and daughters, Of the 14 children only 6 survived. The youngest son got rid of his older brothers but the two daughters were looked after here. We went inside the room where Shah Jahn was imprisoned by his son and where he died. This was again marble, inlaid with beautiful patterns just like the Taj. The middle room was the bedchamber in which the 14 children were conceived, The remains of the lavish decoration are still here but only one corner has been restored to show the amazing gold leaf which covered
Amar Singh
the room. Either side of this are the rooms for the daughters, small but beautiful in their design and decoration.The last room we visited was the Hindu Palace dedicated to Shah Jahn's mother-in-law where Hindu decoration and text can be seen. The Moghuls were Islamic but they incorporated many Hindu and Christian symbols into their architecture.
It was very impressive and we enjoyed the visit. We returned to the hotel for lunch and then had the rest of the day to ourselves. This was pleasant as we have been very busy up to now so a relaxing afternoon ensued.
So far we have thoroughly enjoyed our experiences with the highlight no doubt, the Taj Mahal.

Men ready for festival celebrations
Of course everyone tells you that India is an awakening of all of your senses.Many things are spectacular; some quite confronting. The colours are psychedelic. It is a photographer's dream.

The old part of Varanasi is a maze of tiny crowded lanes. Sometimes we must step aside for a cow or two! Little ""hole in the wall"" shops sell or manufacture all sorts of things. A sunrise boat ride on the Ganges was like my old geography textbooks, only better! Our guide said ""Varanasi is a city of learning and burning"" with its large university and cremation ghats on the banks of the Holy Ganges. We had a rickshaw ride that was really unbelievable. Poor guys peddle bicycle driven rickshaw carts, with two passengers, for kilometres; weaving in and out of crazy, yes, crazy traffic. Cows, cars, motorbikes, kids & elderly pedestrians. All with the loud background honking. It was an unforgettable experience! Fabulous!

India Gate
Geo: 26.9847, 78.1019

To follow on from the previous blog, we took on New Delhi on Thursday 6th October. Firstly we went to an area called Connaught Place. It was sold to us as a more up market shopping area, however it was more a maze of run down buildings with faeces sprayed up the walls and people sleeping and living in every nook and cranny with the odd glitzy shop plonked in there! We swiftly moved on (after buying a top in H&M!) and embarked upon what we thought would be an easy enough 40 minute walk to India Gate... 2.5 hours later we arrived!
We had read somewhere that India gate wasn't really worth the hassle (and after plodding around for 2.5 hours in the blistering heat after taking a wrong turning you can't help but wonder is anything worth anything anymore!) but when you finally reach the Rajpath and you see the memorial India gate, you don't quite forget that your blisters have joined in holy matrimony and made one giant blister baby or the fact that you really need a wee and there's not a toilet in sight, BUT India Gate was definitely worth the hassle. As with most
Thank God we made it!
of the architecture we have encountered in India thus far, the magnitude of India gate was breath-taking.
As you may already know, Indian people are rather 'starey'. Some of them pluck up the courage to come and ask for a photo with you, especially at landmarks such as this (we can never sit down for too long otherwise they begin to form and orderly queue). When we were at India gate we had quite a few photos taken with various people then when we were on our way out one fella came running up to us. He showed us a printed picture of Sooz and himself and we thought he was trying to sell it to us. Nope! He just wanted to show the picture that he had paid for and thank Sooz for posing with him!
Once we returned to Connaught place, we thought we would take a stroll in Central Park. This was one of the nicer areas of New Delhi. Central Park New Delhi holds the 2nd largest national flag in the world. It sits atop a 207 foot pole and is 60 foot wide and 90 foot long! Pretty huge!

We were astonished at just how many people
India Gate
were in Delhi. After a bit of research we have found that the greater Delhi area has a population of almost 25 million people! To put that into perspective, London has a population of around 8.7 million. Delhi also has one of the highest population densities in the world at almost 30,000 people per square mile! We felt like we had met every single one of them too! Our time in Delhi was over and despite enjoying our time there we were definitely ready to be moving on!

Friday 7th October we spent learning a few lessons about Indian trains, where to book tickets and how to spend an hour walking around the station trying to find the tourist ticket office. The train journey itself was really pleasant and we arrived in Agra in about 3.5 to 4 hours.

We had every intention of seeing the Taj Mahal at sunrise like every reviewer has advised. However no one wrote that everyone else would have the same idea and we'd be standing in a queue for an hour to get in after rushing to get our tickets at 5:45am!

We eventually got in and despite missing the sunrise over the Taj, well what
Tried to make friends... Not interested
do you think?! It's the Taj Mahal! Wow! Not only is it visually incredible, it has an amazing story behind it and even though it had thousands of people in it's grounds, it had an amazing serene atmosphere. It was surprisingly calming. If it wasn't for the heat or the fact that we had to check out of our hostel and we hadn't packed, we probably could have sat there all day meditating, people watching and chilling out.

Last on the list for Agra was Agra Fort. Again, breath-taking architecture amazing and a fantastic view of the Taj Mahal. We then got the train to Jaipur. We've spent the day relaxing today in Jaipur and will 'hit the sights' tomorrow!

Kumarasamy Mutt, Kedar Ghat
The lane covering the main Ghats


Kumarasamy Mutt
When we decided to conduct our mothers final rites after her demise on 14th Sep'16, we barely had 5 days to organise the whole trip. After he cremation, our priest handed over the remains in a earthen pot still moist from the ablutions. as per our customs we need to take 4 articles associated with the ceremony being the mortal remains (ashes), the brass utensil, cloth knotted as a symbol and vessel with a spout for pooja.

The airlines person informed that we can carry the Asti, by hand baggage as the security will understand its significance but has to be packed properly. We were in fact prepared take it as baggage if it becomes a security issue. The flights available were from Chennai to Varanasi via Delhi. one should be prepared to dedicate a whole day for travel alone as transit at Delhi could be issue and it happened so as it was not a transit ticket, we had to check in again. The flight also got delayed, being the same airlines, they could accommodate us at a later flight. morning 10am flight actually left at 1PM. and the connecting flight was at 6:30PM. we landed at Varanasi at
Brahaspathi Temple
8PM.

Varanasi is an international airport but local flights park near the terminal and you need to walk to the exit, after Modi became the Prime minister from this constituency which speaks volumes in efficiency.

Our stay was fixed at Kumarasamy Mutt - http://www.srikumaraswamymutt.com/about.aspx and they had provided a transit house at our disposal. The reservations could be made from Tirupandal, Kasi Mutt also as these two are managed by the same trust. The Kumarasamy Mutt was founded by Swamy Kumaraguruparar and his biography can be seen in the above link. This Mutt also manages the Kedar gaht or Kedareshwarar Temple.

The lane from the Kasi Mutt slopes down to the arterial lane that leads to all the famous Ghats and to Kasinath Temple. These lanes are 5 feet wide and accommodates two wheelers, push carts, cattle and people commuting. The bulls and cows that one spots along the lane are pretty docile though looks threatening for a city dweller. The touch of feel of this ancient city could be felt only by a walk through this lane lined with silk dealers, food stalls, milk parlours, numerous small temples and glimpse of Ganges through openings at intervals.
Main bazzar road
During flood time the Ganges swells almost to the top step and leaves tonnes of silt in its wake,

Couple of minutes down the lane brings you to Kedar Ghat, where we spent our maximum time. the entrance to the Ghat is either from a passage adjacent to the temple or through the temple itself as one would wish to bath in the Ganges and carry the sacred water to the temple. Though the temple was rebuilt in 17th century it retains the structure and format of Northern Indian architecture rather than South Indian temple layout. The temple also has a shrine for Lord Badhrinath and Kala Birava deties.

From the Ghats, boats are available for viewing the entire stretch of Varanasi Ghats from a grand stand. The boat man charges about Rs.1,000/- for a single personal trip or can join the pilgrims paying per per person rates. Manikarnika Ghat and Haris Chandra Ghat are the cremation Ghats and you can see the piers burning continuously on cremation of the dead.

In spite of the Governments efforts the hygiene and cleanliness is still an issue though there is a hi-decibel public awareness campaign.

Kasi Viswanath temple
P_20160922_174017
is another must see for a pilgrim - https://shrikashivishwanath.org/. In particular, one should plan for Ganga Arthi at 6:30PM Dashashwamedh ghat and then proceed to Sapta Rishi Arthi at Viswanath temple at 7:30 PM. One would have to negotiate the narrow lanes leading to the temple and it has many entrances and would have to keep the tab on the gate number. The security is very tight and would need to deposit the mobile phone and the hand bag at the private lockers available with the pooja vendors. You would need to carry the ID proof. The Ticket has to be bought in advance and costs Rs.150/- per head from the temples. So plan to visit the temple by 5PM, have a Dharsan, collect the tickets and head for Ganga Arathi. You can expect to do a lot of walking.

Other important temples to visit are near Lalitha Ghat, the wooden temple identical to Pasupathinath temple at Kathmandu, Bindu Madhava temple and Kala Bahirava Temple. The Bindu Madava original temple was destroyed and new one is next to the Mosque where it was originally situated.

The Goddess Lalita also sports the name of Rajarajeswari another name of Durga.
P_20160922_174037_HDR
This Ghat is very steep and you would have to walk through tunnels to reach above levels.

The Kala Bhirava temple is situated in the midst of myriad of lanes and one can easily get lost with out a guide. http://www.varanasi.org.in/kalbhairav-temple-varanasi. The famous Kasi thread that one wears on hand is available as prasad along with holy ash taken from the burning Ghats.

The trip was very tiring as we had to take innumerable baths at the Ghats and walk kilo meters. However be prepared for stomach aches and ear blocks. Antibiotics are a must on your return. Time is well spent visiting this ancient city and commercial quarters and will offer you the range of Banaras sarees, 40% cheaper and Lassi from road side shops.

Since we had gone for specific trip, we returned after the 13th day rites, yet the places to see are Birla Temple at BHUIT, Saranath Stuphi, Bhod Gaya, Gaya and Sangaman at Allahabad.

We plan to return after an year, first visiting Rameshwaram, then Kasi, Allahabad, Gaya then again Rameshwarm to complete the ritual.

Jai Kasinath.

Today was a tourism day, how can you travel to India without visiting the beautiful Taj Mahal? It is impossible like going to Paris without seeing the Eiffel Tower... I learnt that the Taj Mahal is a big ivory-white marble mausoleum commissioned in 1632 and by the Mughal Emperor: Shah Jahanto to house the tomb of his favorite wife : Mumtaz Mahal. This monument is venerated by all of the Indian that is why I wanted to see it. I was really inspired by this building so i drew it! Today was a good day!

May 31st 2016
Published: May 31st 2016


After a long day of travelling and waiting around...which seems to be the only thing we've done recently, it was nice to wonder around somewhere generally interesting for a change.

My first impression of Varanasi, on my last trip, wasn't a good one. It's like India 2.0! There's more traffic, more salesmen, more scams, more thief’s, more Sadhus...etc the list goes on. Oh and it stinks.



Built on the shores of the famous Ganges (Ganga to locals) by Shiva (the god of destruction) it's one of the oldest living cities in the world. People have lived here for thousands of years none stop...and I can't imagine the way of life has changed too much. Everything centres around the Ganges, or more specifically the Ghats (steps) that are situated all along the riverbank. Ghats are used all over India for funeral ceremonies. Varanasi just happens to be the holiest place. It's believed by Hindus that if you die in Varanasi and have your body/ashes rested/scattered in the Ganges you achieve “Moksha” which is where your soul goes to heaven.

As such Varanasi is awash with people waiting to die, what a pleasant thought.



Just before I give you some more information I just want to point out that the Ganges is one of the most polluted water bodies in the world. I can't remember what the measurement is exactly, but I was once told that in legal drinking water you're allowed like five bits of faecal matter per “bit”, in the Ganges there's 3000 bits of faecal matter per “bit” (“bit” is in reference to the measurement I can't remember).



So there's the main burning Ghat where everyone is (good guess!) cremated. There's different height burning areas and different types of wood. Where you get cremated depends on a few different things; finance, social stature and caste.

The caste system is a kind of social hierarchy where depending on what caste you're born into you're basically better or worse than other people. “Brahmins” are the top class, the higher the caste the paler their skin generally. Brahmins are usually rich, have good jobs and education. The bottom caste is the “untouchables”, however a recent change in law means that no one is technically an untouchable anymore.



The castes come from the god Brahman, the “Brahmins” are from his head, each caste (I don't know all their names) has a different section of the body, until finally the untouchables are the feet.



So depending on how much money you and you're family have got you'll get cremated high up on the top steps with sandalwood (5000rs per kilo), the poorest people get cremated on the bottom steps with regular wood (1000rs per kilo) and if you've got no money, family or friends then your body is simply taken to the middle of the Ganges on a boat, and dropped to the bottom with rocks tied around it.



As part of the ceremony the males from the friends and family wash their selves in the Ganges by dunking three times each!

Not only this there's people just jumping in for a swim and some people drink it!

Me and Dave were offered some “Ganga water” when getting blessed in Delhi....safe to say we swerved that one. Good job too the way our stomachs are holding up!



We stayed in Zostel again (450rs A/C dorm) and it was a short walk to the Ghats. We followed the map they provided which walked us through the “old city”. Loads of really tiny little paths in between buildings all crammed in together, open drains....you get the picture. Despite the smell it's quite cool wandering through the little streets, it feels really “India”.



The next stop on the agenda was another dip into culture, and a trip to “Blue Lassi Shop”.

As I mentioned before Varanasi is Shiva's city, he created it. Shiva is a mother f*cking O.G. (“original gangster” for the oldies (does it count if I star a letter out mum?)) he's the god of destruction and almost always depicted with either a chillum or a bowl of Bhang. A chillum if you didn't Google it the other week is the Indian way of smoking cannabis, it's a pipe which can vary in size which you stuff the plant into the end, light up and toke back.

Bhang is a concoction of weed into an edible/drinkable substance, usually consumed in a lassi (like a milkshake) or in cookies.



Because of this the consumption of weed is overlooked in India but especially In Varanasi, with the Sadhus being the main users. Although the same rules don't apply to hashish which is looked upon as an actual drug...go figure...

Bhang is basically legal throughout much of the north of India and consumed in government run shops (but still spoke about under your breath). It comes in three strengths low, medium and strong.

Everyone and the guide book says take caution, don't have the strongest one, even if you're a seasoned smoker. I heard stories of people freaking out and having a “bad trip”. So naturally, me being me, I chose the strongest.

It didn't taste so great but it did the job, although I think the people who freaked out must have been soft, I was just really stoned. A retreat to the room after a couple of hours was a good idea, I didn't fancy re-enacting Leonardo DiCaprio's scene from Wolf of Wall street when he crawls to the car, through the streets of Varanasi.



According to Hinduism weed and bhang helps you adjust your consciousness and better understand and connect with Shiva. I can't really argue with that logic...



Congratulations Varanasi, you're not as bad as I thought.



The day after we were getting the train overnight to Kolkata to fly to Myanmar. So I decided to have another strong Bhang lassi and sleep the journey away.

This turned out to be a catastrophic decision. Somewhere between leaving the platform and taking my seat on the train my wallet either fell out of my pocket or was stolen. Bank card and driving license gone! I'm not blaming the bhang for this, but it might not have happened had I been more aware.



Luckily it wasn't the end of the world, I only lost 1500rs, I had data on my phone so I was able to call home and get the card cancelled. I've got a new card and driving license on the way to home and my parents can send it to FedEx or DHL for my collection at whatever city I happen to be heading to.



The day in Kolkata was spent running around trying to get documents for the fight printed and finding a phone to make an international call to the bank so they could send another card home. It didn't really look like too much was happening there anyway, just another standard Indian city.



So I'm sat writing this in the airport in Dharka, Bangladesh. We flew last night for 28 minutes! From Kolkata to Dharka, so we could wait 15 hours to get the next flight for about two and half hours to Yangon, Myanmar. Nightmare! We had to arrive at the airport three hours early because it was an international flight...and its the shortest flight I've ever been on!



And so ends another chapter in India. I'll definitely be back in the not too distant future because I've still not seen the North! It's too big and interesting for it's own good!

After four months it was was starting to wear thin though, so we're both looking forward to a change in scenery and culture.



Myanmar has only recently opened it's borders to foreign tourists so it's going to be very cool! Hopefully with some respite from salesmen too because no one hassles you in Myanmar from what we've heard!





Goodbye India, It's been a crazy four months!

May 15th 2016

Agra, the home of India's main attraction the Taj Mahal...and one of the hottest places we've been so far.

Getting the train there from Khajuraho was a bit annoying, since there's only two trains that run per day, one leaving at 9.10am and arriving around 5.30pm or one that leaves at 6.20pm and pulls into Agra at 2.20am...the latter being fully booked every day. If we went to the train station to get the ticket it might have been possible, but there wasn't a chance on cleartrip, so we ended up getting the morning train. The first day we'd spent (other than on the ship to Andaman) actually travelling from one place to the next....a waste of a day and the train was super hot.



After about nine hours of a sitting on a train we were surprisingly tired, sitting doing nothing except get dust blown on you all day takes it out of you!

We knew there was another Zostel in Agra so that's where we headed off the train. Not quite as new as the one in Khajuraho, but it was way bigger, and there was actually people there....who went to bed at 10pm! Boring “gap yars”.

The dorm at Agra Zostel was 250rs per person, and there's a little restaurant there which seemed way cheaper than all the local restaurants.



Khajuraho was our first proper stop in the North so the selling was quite intense, but it's just a small village. Agra was a whole new kettle of fish, I'd forgot just how tiring walking around the northern cities was. You can't walk five metres without being offered a tuk-tuk, some sh*t trinket souvenir or a beggar coming asking for “bakshish”. Sometimes the beggars aren't even poor, they're regular people being opportunistic. I'd learned on the train there from a guy I was talking to, that this is because there's no shame in begging in India because the baba's have been doing it for thousands of years...

What started as people living like Jesus and his disciples (basically, it's the easiest way to explain) has turned into any old person asking for money.

I think some people even tell their kids to run over and ask for money from white people.



There are, however, still baba's asking for money. Most of them wear orange robes, they forget their old life and leave all their material possessions behind. These men could've had families and successful businesses etc, but they give all that up to go on the so called final journey of Hinduism, where they eventually die in Varanasi, and get cremated. Once that's been done they're sent to heaven and aren't reincarnated as someone else, which is what Hindus believe happens if you die and don't get put in the Ganges at Varanasi...I think that's it anyway, there's obviously loads more to it.



The children begging is often run by the mafia (yes India has a mafia), if you've seen slumdog Millionaire you'll have seen the scene where the kid gets his eye cut out because blind singers make more money...this is really going on. So as hard as it is sometimes, giving money to the begging kids is exacerbating the problem.



The guy running Zostel told us the best time to see the Taj is at sunrise...so we reluctantly agreed we'd get up early in the morning and go...back to sleep. Not a chance we were getting there for 5.30am!

We eventually got up and got to the Taj for around 10am...it's only a 15 minute walk from the Zostel, but Dave's lazier than me and thought a tuk-tuk would be quicker. He was wrong.

We drove a longer way to the Taj, got stuck in traffic and then dropped off at the main entrance which is the busiest one and had to walk through a park to get there.



The grounds of the Taj are arranged so all three entrances meet in a kind of courtyard, within that courtyard is the actual entrance. A huge gate purpose build for your first view of the Taj. Entering from the side takes away from your initial view of the Taj slightly because you can see the main dome. Unfortunately there was some work being done on the four pillars and they had scaffold around them. But it was still a beautiful sight.

We spent around two hours wondering around the gardens, getting pictures from different angles..or Dave did. My camera died after one picture....clever clogs forgot to charge it.



I wasn't too bothered because I’ve already got photos from the Taj, but annoyingly I couldn't take any pictures at Fatehpur Sikri.

As our time in India is slipping away we planned to see Agra in a day and leave for Delhi after one night there.

Cam had told us he'd spent a few days in Agra and seen some things around there. We wanted to go to Fatehpur Sikri, an allegedly abandoned city.

We got the bus for 30rs and it took just over an hour. You can really tell that the Indian tourist department hasn't got their heads screwed on...or any of the travel agents. For something so close to the Taj you'd have thought they'd milk the rich tourists coming to visit. There was barely any other tourists when we arrived, no entrance fee and officially no one “running the show”.



I was really impressed that the locals have managed to set it up with guides etc...

With there being no entrance fee we got a guide, who was a local guy around the same age as us.

It's a Muslim building so we had to remove our shoes and cover our legs.



Fateh (I'm calling it this from now on, I can't be bothered typing the full name) was originally build by one of the old Kings of Agra, the grandfather of Shah Jahan who build the Taj. It was built as the new capital of his kingdom to replace Agra, but soon after it was finished a war broke out and the King had to retreat further North to a more strategic location. When the war was over 12 years later, for no apparent reason the King returned to Agra instead of Fateh, no one knows why.

The place really should demand more tourists! It's an absolutely beautiful structure...the main gate is over 100 feet tall!



There's a mausoleum inside that's for an old saint and holy man. The story goes that the King had everything he wanted except a son, so he spoke to this holy man and wished for a son, and the holy man blessed him with a son. The holy man was made a saint and when he died buried in Fateh. As such the mausoleum is now blessed with good luck and if you make a wish there it comes true....this is the main reason people come here and probably explains the lack of tourists. So to make this wish you have to give a “small donation, only as much as your heart tells you” is what we're told. We sat down and spoke with this bloke who's praying or muttering a curse under his breath...

He told us we'll give a small donation to get a coloured cloth, some flowers and some string. We're to walk in and put the cloth over the grave, put the flowers to our heads then place them on the grave and tie the string around the carvings in the wall. When we've done this we'll have three wishes.

By “small donation as much as your heart says” they meant a minimum of 500rs for the cloth!

We told them this is too expensive and asked if we could just not buy the cloth...you can. Just the flowers and the string, we said we'd leave 20rs each....they said you have to leave at least 100rs! I'm not sure how much of this is a scam to get money and how much is them believing the wishes come true...there was a lot of Indian tourists doing the whole wish thing. Former President Sarcozy of France (not sure on the spelling) had been and done the wish thing and also been blessed with a child. They made a real point of telling us that she'd been. Like that would make us part with half a days budget!



Towards the end of the tour the guide starts to tell us about his uncle’s shop and family business of carving ornaments out of rock. You see these things all over India, they're all exactly the same. If you've been in India a while you'd already have the same things. They tried the hard sell and the guilt trip...but we can see through this now. The harder they try and sell the less likely I am to entertain them.

You can see how the trick would work though, some people must walk out having spent a small fortune.

Fateh was totally worth it! Another amazing building off the beaten track that most people probably don't know exists.



We got the train the to Delhi that night, we pulled in around 10pm at Hazrat Nizmuddin. This is the other train station in Delhi, nowhere near the tourist area. Straight out of the station and into the chaos of Delhi. People on all sides shouting and asking where we wanted to go. They wouldn't even give a minute to work out what to do, which resulted in a few being told to f*ck off and me threatening to punch one if he followed me again.

We eventually got a tuk-tuk to New Delhi station...and got dropped on the wrong side. Which I didn't realise at first so it took us an hour and a half to find the tourist ticket office. Three people told us to go to the wrong place before we got there.



Sorted the ticket to Jammu for the night after and headed for the Zostel. 600Rs per night in the dorm! Not a chance. We set off to the main tourist street. In any place near a tourist area in India there'll be some “cheating men” as the hotel owners call them. They'll stand on the street and follow you into hotel and try getting commission for taking you there etc, or say they can get you a cheap room and it'll be like double the price they've quoted when you get there.

We ended up going to the place I stayed at last time. Hotel Barajang 400rs per night, wifi and cable TV in the room. Amazingly we were put in the same room I’d had on my last visit.



The day after we were very productive, we sorted out visas for Myanmar and got all the remaining tickets for the trains we're going to need. We went to the shopping area and had a KFC and got blessed with long life in a Hanuman temple. Looking for something to do in the guide book Dave saw the Hanuman temple, a huge statue of him that towers over the metro line...

It was like a fun house at a theme park with gods in the rooms instead of your usual amusements. Really weird. Again they tried taking 500rs after they blessed us.

It's getting tiring people doing things and asking for money after. There's no way I’m giving someone money when they charge you like that, if you want money tell us first then we have the option to say no.



After three and a half months of dealing with India I think we're both about ready to leave and experience a new culture. The heat is too intense, we're constantly covered in a layer of sweat, and sleeping isn't comfortable. It's clear why not many foreign tourists come at this time of the year...unless they're going to the mountains.





Next stop Jammu and the mountains!

Hotel Atithi
Well, first of all I guess I should describe the trip to Agra from Varanasi since it took a good portion of the day. We were supposed to arrive in Agra by 6:45, about 13 hours after leaving Varanasi. My wife and I both woke up around 4am, figuring we’d had a decent night’s sleep, and that we be arriving in a couple of hours. I slept better this time because I didn’t have my backpack in the little bed with me, and I wasn’t on the top bunk, but the middle, with my wife below me. Nothing went well from the time we got up. I kept looking for and expecting the “chai guy” to come by but I never saw one, even the night before. Secondly, we found out around 6am that the train was delayed at least an hour or two. Fortunately, we did have water left over or the extra hours might have been very tough. My wife knew I was looking for a chai and finally around 10am my wife heard the chai guy and bought one for me. I was spending most of the time standing at the open door watching all the goings on.

We finally pulled into Agra at almost 11am, 4 hours late, for a total train trip of 17 hours!

When we left the train station, there was a mini-bus waiting to take us to our hotel for the night, Hotel Atithi. The trip was fairly long, but the streets didn’t seem nearly as crowded. We passed the Red Fort of Agra along the way, and it looked pretty cool. We were going to visit it later that day, along with the Taj Mahal. We’d gotten in so late we ended up being on a tight schedule. Hotel Atithi was probably the most modern and clean hotel so far. They had a decent small restaurant below the lobby, air-conditioned rooms (if you had your key in the holder), and even a swimming pool, which we would not be able to take advantage of on our tight schedule. The bed was very wide again, but the bathroom had a shower curtain so we didn’t make as much mess on the floor. On a side note, the room we were first assigned to had not be cleaned up at all, with the bed unmade, another unmade bed on the floor, and glasses
Entering to the Red Fort
and paper on the tables. We ended up trading with the guide, who waited until that room was cleaned up.

Our guide gave us some time to get settled in and take a shower, then we all piled into the same min-bus as before and headed to the Red Fort. A separate guide met us at the entrance, then escorted us throughout the fort with some very good information. Unfortunately, I couldn’t hear about half of it, and some of what I heard was not understandable. My fault mostly due to my hearing aids, but the guides do all tend to have heavy British/Indian accents, like you hear in the movies. The Red Fort is enormous, and more like a series of palaces. I think there must have been at least four separate courtyards, and not small ones, besides all the rooms in numerous buildings. I won’t recount the history, partly because you’d be bored and partly because I don’t remember it well. Basically, one of the “emperors” or muhalas (sp) had it built in the 16th Century, before the Taj Mahal. The ruler that had the Taj Mahal built did live there with his three wives though. The
Red Fort ramp to gate
Red Fort is a must see, if you are in Agra or even just visiting India. One caution however, they are very strict here and at the Taj Mahal about what you can bring in. No pens, pencils, lipstick, creams, cigarettes, lighters, matches, etc., etc. I’m not sure of all the restrictions, but there are many. I got lucky at the Red Fort because I’d head our guide talk about what not to bring to visit the Taj Mahal, but not that it applied to the Red Fort. Thank heavens our guide sort of pulled us through the security, because I did have cigarettes and lighter, and one lady had pens and lipstick.

When we left the Red Fort, we were taken back to the hotel for lunch and to freshen up. We only had a couple of hours because he’d already arranged transport and tickets for the Taj Mahal at 3:30pm, so we ate lunch in the hotel. Manoli ordered a Hawaiin salad, and I had the Hotel Atithi Thali Vegetarian Plate. My plate, or platter, consisted of 4 pita type breads, one crispy bread, six small tins containing yogurt, mixed veggies, steamed rice with veggies, a cold
Photos inside the Red Fort
pea and yogurt dish, and 3 tins of sauces to dip my bread in. Everything was very tasty, and only 1 of the sauces was spicy, and not that spicy at that. It also included coffee and ice cream. See the photo to get a better idea of what it included. I think my plagte was only 300 Rupees. They have the same thing, with chicken added, for about 500 Rupees.

Soon after lunch, we all piled back into our mini-bus for the trip to see the Taj Mahal. Our guide restated the rules about what not to bring, so I left my whole fanny pack in our room and Manoli went through her day bag and camera bag to be safe. We had no problem with security, except the lady asking what was in the little pouch of the camera bag, as she opened it, and I told her memory cards, so she just unzipped and rezipped and waved us through. There is a rule about no gasoline-burning vehicles being allowed within 1 kilometer of the Taj, so we had to park a ways outside. We picked up our tickets, complimentary bottle of water, feet covers for the
Indian ""hot tub"" in Red Fort
marble floors, and boarded an electric mini-bus. When we were dropped off near the East Gate, the guide asked if anyone had any of the forbidden items, and sure enough one of our ladies had pens and lipstick and another had two bottles of sunscreen and face cream, so he left them with a friend outside the gate. The streets closest to the Taj Mahal are full of souvenir vendors, along with the typical food, drink, and snack vendors. Our guide told us we had until 7pm, But we were back soon after 6pm.

We returned to the hotel, with a stop at an ATM since there wouldn’t be any tomorrow at Tordi Garh. Most of the folks went out for dinner somewhere, but Manoli wasn’t hungry, so I stayed in the room with her and ordered mixed fruit and a Coke, which the waiter brought up to our room. After eating and finishing yesterday’s blog, we both went to sleep. Tomorrow we will take a long public bus trip, then a jeep of jeeps to our next stop, Tordi Garh and the Tordi Palace Hotel.

Lizard with Hindi spot?
We woke up a bit later this morning and had our breakfast in the hotel. We had to pack up our bags for transfer to the train station later. With nothing planned for today, and a 3pm departure, we were in no hurry, so we just went out strolling. At Assi Ghat, we watched the yoga class for a bit, since two of our ladies were participating. I’ve circled them in the photo. What we saw was not what we thought of as normal yoga, in that many of the folks were sitting in chairs pretty much the whole time. I think a lot of it had to do with breathing and … enlightenment. After watching the yoga class, we strolled around a bit, then headed back to the hotel. Our bags would be brought down and stored until we were ready to leave for the train to Agra. Most of the folks on our tour wanted to go back to eat lunch at the Vaatika Café and Pizzeria where we ate dinner before. I had a rather spicy dish with bread and a banana milkshake. The milkshake helped neutralize the spiciness, and tasted very good too! Manoli had a green
Morning yoga class with 2 of our girls
salad.



After a slow, relaxing lunch, we all went back to the hotel to wait our transfer to the train station. This trip, to Agra, was going to be even longer, about 13 hours, or so. Remember the “or so.” Our guide reminded us that we would not be able to get much to eat on the train and recommended we order something from the hotel to take with us. Manoli and I both opted for mixed fruit, which we figured would keep well, and be refreshing. Our bags were loaded onto several tuk-tuks and away we went. The trip was quite long, and stifling hot, but we got there in one piece. Again, our platform was the very last one out, up and down several flights of stairs. We arrived at our platform with time to spare and all congregated around a snack stand. It was funny to watch all the young Indian men staring at our young ladies. One young kid was trying to covertly take an iPhone photo of them, but got caught and embarrassed. While we were waiting for the train, I spotted a monkey sitting on the wall with a little baby.

Check out the photo. We only seen a couple of monkeys up to this point, but would see many more later in the trip. Our train arrived and we all piled on, this time almost all of us were together, plus one Indian lady that arrived late, and a Japanese girl that spent a lot of time talking and playing with our only guy, Kaeren from Australia. We kidded him about when the wedding was going to be and such.

Knowing the ride was going to be long (but not just how long at this point), after chatting for a while and eating our dinners, we all turned in around 8pm. Tomorrow, Agra, the Red Fort and the Taj Mahal!

Sunrise ritual at Assi Ghat
We woke up after a good night’s sleep and went down to meet our guide for our included sunrise boatr ride. The boat trip last night wasn’t included, but was only something like 300 Rupees extra, so just about everyone went. We strolled down to Assi Ghat again and saw the sunrise ritual taking place at Assi Ghat as we climbed into our boat, this time motorized. The main sunrise ritual was being held at Dashashwamedh Ghat, so we headed that way, stopping briefly to observe the sun rise and take photos. It is supposed to be good luck to be on the Ganges when the sun rises. We then arrived at Dashashwamedh Ghat and observed their ritual for a bit before returning to Assi Ghat. After another good breakfast in the hotel, the five of us that had opted for the Sarnath optional tour, grabbed a couple of tuk-tuks that our guide had arranged for and headed out. He told us that we would need to pay 600 Rupees for the tour, per tuk-tuk, at the end of the tour, so the 3 other ladies got a bit better deal. Sarnath is supposedly the birthplace of Buddhism.

Besides a
Sunrise from the Ganges River
couple of interesting more modern temples, there are fairly extensive ruins and a very cool tower, that I think was originally covered in gold. They even have a sign next to it stating “Please do not attach gold foil to the monument”! We got to the area a bit early, so the tuk-tuk drivers left us off a bit further up the road so we could visit the more modern Mulagandhakuti Vihara temple which was already open. Of course, as it seems to be with all temples, we all had to remove our shoes before entering. They had an “attendant” who made sure we did, and placed them in the rack for us. This temple was quite small compared to most of the others we’ve visited, but it was quite ornate, with a large gold Buddha statue, and apparently a Buddhist priest in attendance. After a brief walk around inside and some photos, we went back outside to check out the “Tree Temple” next door. Here we saw a series of 27 Buddha-style statues with a different name, title, attribute or whatever under each one. There were also a whole row of “prayer rolls”, or so one of the ladies

with us said, made of brass that you could spin around. I think the tree temple was more interesting than the main temple.

We’ noticed an old, very large building next door to the newer temple, but apparently the gate to there was closed, so after retrieving our shoes we continued back down the road towards the main ruins. The n ext gate down led us to another small Buddhist temple, but again, the gate to the ruins was closed. After a quick look inside this second temple, we continued down the road and found the main entrance to the ruins. You have to buy a ticket from the building next to the entrance before going in. Our tickets cost 200 Rupees each, and I think they are good for a number of sites around India, or at least that is what it seemed from looking at them. Anyways, by this time it was getting quite hot, so we toured the ruins in stages, pausing periodically under trees for the shade. I won’t say the ruins here were extensive, but I found them interesting and worth the entry fee. I just wish they’d given us a booklet or at
Chet Singh Ghat from boat
least put signs with explanations on them. All they had were simple signs stating the name of each set of ruins.

When we left the ruins, after about half an hour or so, we continued down the road and found the Standing Buddha. This is a statue of Buddha, standing versus the normal sitting position, about 85 meters high! It is made of stone, not gold like most of the other Buddha statues, but was quite impressive due to its size and the fact that it was standing. By now it was getting quite hot (we found out later it was a record hot day at 111!), so after grabbing a bottle of soda we walked back up the road until we found our tuk-tuk drivers, and headed back to the hotel.

When we arrived at the hotel, it was well after noon, so we paid our driver the 600 Rupees and a couple hundred extra, and took a small nap. Several of the ladies from our tour decided to go shopping, so off we went. After the long walk down the road to the main market area, Manoli and I went our separate way from the ladies
Darbhanga Ghat from boat
to do some shopping. Strangely enough, even as big as the market area is, we bumped into them two or three times. The third time, we all agreed to go looking for the Blue Lassi Shop again for lunch. It took a while, but we finally found it. After a filling lassi, we found our way out of the market to the Ganges and started walking along it, looking for the rest of the group that would be observing evening prayers. We finally found them, but I wasn’t particularly interested in sitting there for an hour and headed back to the hotel, leaving Manoli with the group. They finally showed up fairly late. I’d finished the previous blog and posted it before hitting the hay.

Tomorrow we have a short day with nothing planned, so I probably won’t do a blog for that day. We head to the train station at 3pm to catch our overnight sleeper train to Agra and the Taj Mahal.

JC with chay on train close to Varanasi
Well, we both ended up getting about 4 or 5 hours of sleep. We woke when it was still dark and hardly anyone else on the train was up and about. Soon enough, everyone started to stir, except the two ladies staying near us. Apparently, at least one of them had taken some sleep aid! We watched from the bathroom area as people came and went, using the bathroom and brushing their teeth. One guy must have spent 30 minutes brushing his teeth, rinsing his mouth, and hacking. By this time it was light outside, so I could watch the countryside near Varanasi as it went by, sipping the chay I bought from a train vendor. When the train pulled into the station at Varanasi, we eventually got our gear together, having to deal with lots of folks coming and going. We finally got off the train with our luggage and our guide recruited a number of tuk-tuk drivers to take us all to our hotel in Varanasi for the next 2 nights, Hotel Haifa. Although the traffic wasn’t as bad as Delhi, it was still pretty chaotic and the ride was longer that I’d figured. Varanasi is considerably smaller than
Hotel Haifa in Varanasi
Delhi, but I guess the station is still quite a ways from the hotel.

Hotel Haifa was okay, but not quite as nice or clean as the hotel in Delhi. We went to our air-conditioned room on the 3rd floor, unpacked a little, learned what switches did what, and then headed down for breakfast. The hotel offered 4 different types of breakfasts, plus individual items. Manoli had the American breakfast, which is just toast with jelly and tea or coffee. I ordered the Haifa Special which included juice, a salad, hummus, bread, eggs, coffee or tea, and warm milk. Both combined were only about 300 Rupees or $4.50. After breakfast, we all went for a long walk down to and along the Ganges River. It was pretty cool to see the variety of buildings along the river, and the variety of things people were doing. Some folks were just strolling along, others were washing clothes, and some were swimming or bathing. The river looks quite filthy, but apparently, water tests done show it to be much cleaner than you’d imagine. The Hindi people believe the river is the living embodiment of Mother Ganges, one of their principle gods. Bathing
Our first cows in the streets.
and drinking the water is supposed to cleanse your soul, among other things. You can buy empty water bottles from many little vendors along the way to take home for use. Could you imagine folks taking bottles of the Mississippi home to drink?

After getting a good sense of the Ganges and the people of Varanasi, we went through some of the market streets to a famous shop called the Blue Lassi Shop. They supposedly have been making the best lassi for 75 years. Lassi is a fruit and yogurt drink that is so think I doubt you could drink it. They load it up with any variety of fruit from mango, to pineapple, orange, pomegranate, etc. I ordered a mango with cashew nut and chocolate and Manoli had a simpler papaya lassi. Mine was full of fruit, cashews and some chocolate, and very tasty. I think it was about70 Rupees for the normal ones and 105 for the full of fruit varieties. After our so-called lunch, we all went to see a demonstration of silk products. I can’t remember the name of the place, but they explained to us, in detail, the difference between the fake silk products
Looking at Varanasi along the Ganges.
and the varieties of real silk, including cashmere, pashmina, and two other silk/wool combinations. Basically, if you try to burn the real stuff, it barely burns, gives off a smell of human hair burning, and only leaves a powdery residue. The fake cotton products flare up in flames and leave no residue, while the synthetic stuff melts. The demonstration and their products were quite impressive, but we weren’t sure just how reasonable their prices were. Manoli liked their silk/wool combination blankets, but at $200 wasn’t that sold on them. I think she’d buy one if she was sure it was a good deal. I’ll have to admit that the blanket was the thinnest but warmest blanket I’d ever seen or felt.

After leaving the silk shop, we all took rickshaws or bicycle tuk-tuks back to the hotel to rest and get ready for an evening boat ride on the Ganges. Around 6pm we walked down to Assi Ghat where our boat was waiting. We all piled into a long rowboat and were taken up the Ganges towards the sight of the evening prayer ritual. We stopped along the way to light floating candles to put in the river, supposedly
Bottle vendor for Ganges river water, with complimentary goat
granting wishes by doing so. After lighting all the candles, we continued up to join a host of other boats sitting off shore of the big evening prayer ritual, where 5 colorfully dressed priests did a song and dance routine, often with flaming candles or pots. It was quite impressive to watch and hear. After 20 minutes or so, we left and our boat guy returned us to Assi Ghat, which was by the way quite a distance back. I really felt sorry for the guy and the amount of effort he was obviously putting into rowing us.

When we returned to Assi Ghat, we all walked up the river a little bit to the Vaatika Café and Pizzeria for dinner. Manoli had a fruit salad and I ate a mushroom and veggie pasta dish. Both were excellent and not very expensive. By this time it was almost 10pm, so we walked back to the hotel to retire. Another full day of extreme heat made most of us quite tired and ready to turn in. The temperature was probably in the 90s or more all day, but at least it was a dry heat. I was able to finish

my blog from Delhi, but then ran out of steam.

Vipassana (Dhamma Bodhi - Bodhgaya) La cloche qui nous a reveillé pendant 10 jours à 4h du matin >(
Bonsoir à tous !

Nous revoilà avec un paquet de choses à vous raconter ! Nous sommes restés les 10 jours de cours de la méthode de méditation Vipassana à Bodhgaya et avons enfin été libérés. Nous avons pris un bus dans la foulée pour arriver à Varanasi, où nous avons passé quelques jours avant de se préparer à passer la frontière népalaise.

Du coup, la méditation pendant 10 jours, c'est fait. Ca n'était franchement pas facile, physiquement et mentalement car une bonne partie du discours ne me plaisait pas. J'ai quand même envie de vous dire à tous d'essayer et de vous faire une opinion de la chose. J'avais parfois l'impression d'être dans une secte (comme la secte dans la série Leftovers, les gens en blanc qui ne peuvent pas parler 😊 ) et parfois l'impression d'avoir un contrôle immense de mon libre-arbitre malgré l'extrème discipline demandée. Les gens n'ont pas besoin d'une technique pour être heureux, et le discours s'attachait à prouver que le monde entier souffrait et nécessitait vipassana. Oh, non le monde entier ne souffre pas !

Enfin, vivre dans un parfait moment présent pendant quelques jours fait aussi du bien.

Dans la
DSC_0062
foulée nous avons donc pris un bus pendant 8h pour arriver à Varanasi. Et pas d'accident cette fois ! Nous avions tellement de choses à nous dire que le trajet est presque passé vite ! Nous sommes dans une gesthouse où nous avons accès libre à une cuisine, on a eu l'occasion d'acheter plein de légumes différents. Varanasi est une ville très interessante. C'est un concentré de l'Inde. Le cannabis est légal ici, sachant que Shiva fume, le gouvernement l'a autorisé pour tout le monde dans cette ville qui l'idôlatre.

Demain soir c'est reparti et nous allons vers le Népal ! Grosses bises à tous.

Aurore.




Oui Vipassana s'est enfin terminé. C'était un peu hard par moment, le temps passait trop lentement et c'est vrai qu'on se serait cru dans une secte par moment et une partie de discours est un peu barré. xD Mais c'était une bonne expérience en fin de compte bien qu'un peu fatiguante. On a tenu le coup et on en est satisfaits ! Ce qui ne nous tue pas nous rend plus fort =) Ca a fait une sacrée transition avec Varanassi, retour dans une grosse ville alors qu'on
DSC_0075
Le Hall de méditation... zZzZz
était en pleine campagne et en plein silence. Mais c'est une ville vraiment agréable car assez touristique et les Indiens sont plutôt peace... On a fait un ptit boat trip sur le Gange hier et on est tomber sur un mec trop sympa qui nous a amené dans un ptit resto bar underground (mais minuscule il doit avoir 3 tables basses avec des poufs autours) et on a bu nos premières bières Indiennes. Aujourd'hui on a pris un cours de cuisine pour pouvoir manger les légumes bizarres qu'on avais achetés sur le marché (le secret c'est qu'il faut mettre de l'ail, de l'oignon et plein de piment ˆˆ) et plus tard dans l'aprem un autre de musique (cithare et flute traversière) et quelque emplettes...

On reprend le train demain et le checkout de la guest house est trop tôt demain matin. Faut qu'on refasse les sacs vite fait avant d'aller au lit !

Bisous et bonne nuit 😉

Varanasi day 1
Val and I took a rick to the airport early Saturday morning for noonish flight to Varanasi for our yoga retreat with people form The Yoga House in Bandra where we do yoga every weekend. Arrived at airport and checked in, had coffee and a few yoginis also on the retreat. The flight was smooth, I read and listened to music and chatted with Val. We arrived at Varanasi around 2 o'clock and our yoga teachers were waiting for us with 2 vans to go to our hotel. The first impression I had of Varanasi was that it looked like a small (but of 3million people) town. The main road for the airport into the city was two lane going both ways with lots of green and dirt areas along the sides. There were typical Indian convenience shops and lots of people on traditional Indian bicycles, bicycle rickshaws and lots of cows and goats. It looked like time had stop 50 years ago. People had their home doors open sitting on the porch chatting With friends, children playing on the street a very relaxed slowed paced way of living. We got to our local colonial British style hotel
IMG_2359
check in and went to our rooms to relaxed for a bit. At 4:30 the phone rang and it was the yoga teacher telling is to get to the front desk it was time for our sightseeing tour of Varanasi and the Ganges. We drove through Varanasi's traffic with ricks, cars, bicycles,motorcycles and lots if cows and goats. It was definitely a cultural experience very different than Mumbai. The streets were narrowed and full of dirt and sometimes there would be a circle in the middle where a police officer would stand to direct to traffic. We got to the Ganges Ghat and explored for a bit taking photos and drinking chai from small clay cups. I got a henna tattoo on my hand (that barely lasted a few hours) that a very cute smart 12 year old girl did for me. We got on a two floor boat and cruise through the Ganges watching the Maharashtra's castles, the ashrams and the temples and the rituals of the Hindus burning the bodies of their relatives and the ritual to say goodbye to the sun by singing and chanting mantras. It was a beautiful evening

Varanasi day 2
Yoga on
IMG_2361
boat Assi Ghanges ghat
I woke up at 5 AM and met the others at 5:30 in the lobby to go see the sunrise from Assi Ganges Ghat. We got to the ghat and lots of people. Where there already.there was a group of woman dancing and chanting and singing to a tune and we heard the voice of a women chanting and praying in Hindi. It was the sunrise welcoming of the sun ritual. We then got on a boat (same as the day before) and placed our mats on the top of the boat and started our 1 hour yoga session as the boat moved towards the beach on the other side of the river. The class started with chanting om and then the sun salutation, followed by warrior poses (which were tricky to made without falling due to the movement of the boat) then we did (tried to do) tree and balancing poses and ended the class with shoulder stand and meditation. We then got off the boat (had to put legs and feet in the Ganges river) and walk on the beach. Jogging, doing yoga poses, jumping and photos shooting were a few activities. It was
IMG_2362
a fun get to know people bonding activity. I was the only person who wore her flip flops to get in the river (I couldn't bear to put my feet in the gross dirty sand of the river.) I hope I am sin free and clean of bad energy as I did submerge in he Ganges up to my knees!!

We then headed to the hotel for breakfast and a nap. My friend Val was feeling better so she joined us for breakfast.At 1:00 we headed to Sarnath temple and museum. It was a cool temple to visit with lots of antiques from the British times in India. We walked around the streets full of bikes, motorbikes, ricks, trucks and cars and had some Indian snacks (nuts and peanuts and dried fruit) and then head to the temple and it's gardens. We walked around a garden with an open area where a stupa was supposed to exist before. Took pictures with the monks and walk around the ruins taking pictures and enjoying the calmness and peace of the temple. We sat for about 30 minutes for meditation and there were a few locals sitting chanting and praying which was
IMG_2363
pretty cool and made he experience even more authentic and peaceful and calmed. We then headed back to a smaller Buddhist temple where the Bodhi tree is and some praying flags and bells. We headed back to the car and back to the hotel. It was pouring so yoga was cancelled so instead I did a few asanas I like and find challenging (salutation of the sun, stretching, pigeon pose, warrior, balancing poses, crow and headstand. We had delicious dinner and headed to our rooms to rest for the next day

Varanasi day 3
Woke up at sunrise to head out to the ashram on the Assi Ghat Ganges river to do yoga. The yoga class again was a hatha class and it moved flowy like the other classes, we did a series of sun salutations, balancing poses and arm balance poses and finished with head stand.
We headed to the hotel to shower and changed and head out to the Kashi palace and temple Banaras
Hindu temple. The Palace was beautiful, but lacked mantainance and care. We took some photos of silly is doing yoga poses (see my yoga around the world Facebook album!) and headed into
IMG_2365
the Varanasi market to try and see another temple.

The market was another tradition Indian market were you entered a big area with vendors of food, clothes, religion goods, souvenirs, pharmacies, toiletries, hair products, whatever you can imagine was sold there. Then you started wanderkng in through the alleys and eventually you were in a maze full of shopping stalls. It was raining and humid and very hot and loud and I become anxious when I overwhelmed and I am overly motivated by sensory overload. I started to sweat and mumble to Val that she could not understand what I was saying. Val and I decided we did not want to go in the temple and we would wait outside with Arcal one of he yoga teachers. At that point we were standing or leaning on a small area by a wall holding bags of he others and I started thinking of my previous trip to India around Rajasthan with Kyle and how when I was anxious he would calmed me so much by simply holding my hand or hugging me. Without any logical or reasoning explanation I had tears in my eyes and burst into tears. Val and
IMG_2366
Arcal tried to comfort me, but Arcal said something truest the tears roll and On my way out it is a process let it be! By the time others came back fr temple I had stop crying, but I was nostalgic and wanted to go home. They ate some pain puri ( a ball of dough dipped into a sugary syrup) and a few minutes later we were on the way fly he car. It took awhile to navigate around to exit the market and when we did we all sat on bicycle crickshaws Val and I shared one and headed to the car. It was a bumpy and overly sensory load way and all I did was close my eyes and breath to release my anxiety. We got to the hotel and grabbed our yoga mats for a well deserved relaxing class and headed to the ashram.
The yoga class was amazing I wa sable to focus and relax and let out all the anxiety from he day. I felt so much lighter at at end. We had chai and dinner and then chatted as the Indians do. It was cold and I wa skier wearing a sweatshirt and
IMG_2367
a hoodie ( the yoga teachers gave as a present a few wool scarves to some guests, but not to me and Val we were pissed and cold. I was ready to go home by then, but we didn't until like 9 PM. I crashed on my bed until 4:50 when the alarm started to ring
Varanasi day 4
We woke up at 4:50 am and got ready for a last day of yoga on the Ganges river bank ashram.
It was a cold morning and we were all bundled up in layers of clothes and warm wool cozy scarves and chals. The class was hatha vinyasa. We went through some chanting and breathing and stretching exercises and then started our sun salutation. It was cold and my body did not get warm up for awhile. We did a few twisting , bending and backward bending poses. We moved to standing balancing poses and ended the practice with the head and shoulder stand which now I can do on my own and without too much wall support. We drank chai and chatted and ate some sprouts and headed back to hotel to pack up for our noon flight. Val and
IMG_2368
I wanted to buy some postcards, wool scarves and other things, but the retreat was not well planned we ended up going after yoga on our own with the driver we had and spent about 10 minutes shopping while the drive back and forth to the hotel was about 45 minutes due to traffic. It was a shame for us and a bit stressful, but we got our wool scarves at least.

We grabbed our bags and headed to the airport.

Traveling Tips:
Flights with IndiGo are cheap and excellent service if you book in advance.

The Yoga House is a yoga CENTER in Bandra Mumbai and it is a vegan cafe also excellent delicious food and awesome yoga classes.

We stayed at ""fancy"" for Indian stand antes hotel, but it was far from ghats it is better to say on the river.

February-March gets cold about 5-10C be prepared for rain and cold

Sarnath temple and palace are beautiful totally recommend it

The Varanasi market is really crowded and is basic a street food, clothes whatever you can get type of place there is a temple at the top, but it has
IMG_2369
many entrances and for foreigners. It is paid and only one entrance available. I did not go. But was told that it is a traditional Hinduism temple.

The ashram were we did yoga was really basic as traditional Indian yoga ashram with single or double rooms, shared bathrooms, food was served on aluminum trays and was all vegetarian. The view of the room where we did yoga (open space) was towards the Ganges.

- Traffic is insane!!! Buses, cars, motorbikes, bicycles (with luggage up to the height of a truck seriously!!!), animals, cows, dogs, sheep, goats, cats, horses, rickshaws, bicycle rickshaws, pedestrians, etc.

- lots of restaurants to eat on the Ganges river ghat.

- must see sunrise and sunset rituals in he Ganges.

- we went to a few museums ( history culture of the city), I cannot remember he names and my friend Val had a few questions and the guide did not answer any. I would skip it.

I enjoyed Varanasi and the yoga it gave me some clarity in my mind and soul. I wished I had spent a few more days just walking exploring and discovering it on my

own not in a tour.

Om Shanti Shanti Shanti Namasten

Getting a haircut
Geo: 25.282, 82.9563

The incredible India, unbelievable India, everything is possible India : All advertising slogans that attempt to describe this continent of infinite variety.

With a brief visit to the evocative temples of Kujaraho we then flew to our last adventure which was very appropriately in Varanassi, the holy town with a long history on the Ganges to which Hindu, Jain and Buddhist pilgrims travel to bathe in the waters, take water away in elegant bowls and plastic buckets and when sick come here to die and be cremated on its banks, where their Ashes then travel down the river to the sea.

Fortunately our hotel looked out onto the Ghats, the Western shore where all the action happened. Unfortunately there were heavy downpours both mornings we were there so we missed the sunrise, but we heard the Ragas played and I joined the public yoga session for an hour from 6.30, a lone European among many Indian visitors. We were rowed down river, slowly, as the sun finally emerged in the afternoon, and at close hand watched the range of activities mixing in close proximity. Dead bodies, wrapped in orange rested on the steps until the fire was built, fires were lit
A typical street scene
with corpses half hidden in their centre, bathers, more men than women, dipped repeatedly in the river a few yards away and changed in and out of their clothes, including women pleating yards of sari fabric around them.

As night fell the elaborate puja (purification ceremony) began, paid for by a family alongside us who were blessed in return for their contribution.Music and chanting blared out from the speakers and flood lights dazzled us while three Brahmins conducted the ceremony.

A driver nicknamed 20Kg because he was so slim drove us to and from Varanassi airport and out to the Buddhist pilgimage site of Sarnath, where Buddha preached his first sermon.

Temporary respite from the dirt and squalor of the crowded streets was provided by a western style cafe within a textile shop providing another browsing opportunity, and a modern vegetarian (again! Lots of Panzer, curd Cheese) Cafe for supper, where we were lucky to get apple juice, beer in disguise, wrapped around by serviettes, given that few places have a license.

Then finally the end of the adventures. On the way to the airport Peter was led off into a side street to make a last minute techy purchase, only to be
Silk weaver
found at that price in incredible India, leading markets in technology, and then struggled to pay for it because bank connections and ATMS don't work efficiently, along with so many other essential aspects of daily life.

An uneventful flight to Delhi took us to a boring Ibis hotel for the night, where we were relieved to find our suitcases had been left by Manohar, our reliable long term driver, who transported them to Delhi when he dropped us off at Khajuraho airport, 3 days ago.

With only a few hitches on our travels and series of exciting adventures, we arrived safely at Heathrow, after a privileged flight in club class, as a result of Peters careful management of bank cards.

India, India, India.....I currently write this blog in my bed, its 4.30 in the afternoon but after a long day of continuously sharting myself (Something I haven't done since I was 5 years old) it's the most appropriate place for me to be right now. You may think it must be the Dehli belly but it skipped me there and waited til we're in the colourful town of Varanasi.

Let's rewind back to New Dehli though to explore our first few days in India. We arrived after a long, long journey of travelling from Sri Lanka. We were trying to save money and as a result spent 28hours awake. We got out of the airport and on to the metro system. A man got on and got very close to me even though the rest of the metro was empty. I initially thought he was checking out my backpack but later as more and more men entered on to the metro it was clear they were just staring at me and Rob. We found it rather strange as all the advertisements are of mainly white people and so I never expected to feel like I stuck out like such a
DSC_9165
sore thumb!

Once we finally got to our hotel we crashed out for a 12 hour sleep only to wake up with a man entering our room! This was the start of what would be our 5 day Dehli experience!

After a day of recovery and movie marathon we decided to go out and venture the city. We caught the metro into Connaught place and walked into a park. It was valentines day so we watched as couples sat down for picnics and we admired the biggest flag of India we'd ever seen. There was a young well dressed man standing next to us and he struck up a conversation. We chatted away as he explained he was from North India and had come to Dehli to study. He asked how we found India and if we knew our way around. This was when we told him we were heading to the train station to book a train for Rishikesh for after our intrepid trip. He said that there was a government tourist office that could help foreigners book train tickets and we could get a map of Dehli from there. He said he'd walk us half way
DSC_9185
as he was meeting friends in starbucks as he was going to watch a movie with them. We (stupid muppets) thought he was ever so kind and thanked him for his help.

Turned out the government office was not at all that, but we still hadnt clicked until we'd handed over £900 for transport, accommodation and food for our remaining route through India. when we finally left the office and saw the sign that it wasn't government run ( wasn't obvious by the way) we turned a shade of greeny white. So we plucked up the courage to go back in and claim a refund. Our receipt had on it that if we cancelled we'd lose 10% which we were willing to lose. It took us 4 hours to convince them that we didn't want the trip and our money back. Within that time I saw the man we'd met in the park sneak past with another poor couple of tourists. We also got sent round to a back road office that was quite scary as it was at this point it was clear they were working in big groups and we felt really intimidated. It wasn't until they
DSC03146
took Rob to an ATM to get money out in exchange for a refund on my card that I really started to freak out. I imagined that they were gonna kill Rob in a back Street and that a bunch of men were gonna come into the office kidnap me and sex traffic me like something out of Taken ( completely overreacting!)

We finally got back to our hotel from the exhausting day of being ripped off. We took losing £200 in total as a blessing and reflected on our experience. In hindsight the situation could have been a lot worse and we could have ended up in a very dangerous situation. This knocked us both a bit sick. We'd had such wonderful experiences by trusting people and we'd forgot about the deceit that people are capable of. It learnt us a really valuable lesson.

The next day we decided to venture out again to get to the train station to book our tickets to rishikesh. We had it all planned to get in a tuk tuk and turn up directly outside the station to avoid anymore scammers. So we got in our tuktuk and the guy chats

away to us.. ""Have you been here before?"", ""where are you from?"" He even discussed how a poor old couple had been scammed and sent to the wrong hotel from the airport. This is when we told him about our experience and he apologised and said not all of them were like that. That's when we pulled up outside a door with stairs leading up a small passageway. The sign on the door states its the government tourist office for railway tickets...... To cut a long story short he tried to scam us and dropped us 10 minute walk away from the station. Even when Rob refused to pay him if he didn't take us to the actual station he dropped us outside the back of the station and there were people outside adament that we were in the right place ( we weren't). It was totally disheartening and gave us the impression that everyone in Dehli were scam artists and heartless! When we finally found for ourselves where the station was and got our tickets booked we decided that we were going to face this country as a challenge head on (rather than crawling back to our hotel and
DSC03169
waiting for our month in India to end!).

We did get to explore Dheli when we chose that metro and walking were going to be our only way. We went to India gate ( memorial for Indian and British soldiers who had fought in world war 1) and had Indian tourists asking to have photos with us ( we're probably on a website called uglywhitepeople.com now) It was a nice experience and we started to feel a little settled again once we ignored the curious and sometimes aggressive stares and the horrific roads of honking horns and near misses with tuk tuks,rickshaws, cars and people.

We are now currently on our intrepid trip and after spending another day visiting a mosque in Dehli we caught a sleeper train to veranasi....

Veranasi is a pilgrimage for those who are dying or have died. They have their bodies cremated by the side of the Ganges river or weighted down under the water. Hindus believe this place is sacred as the lord Shiva (One of the Gods) let goddess Ganges flow from his hair so that people could go peacefully to the other side and also be reincarnated.

From
DSC03179
my personal account I didn't feel it was very ssacred. The bodies were thrown on to bonfires and the bones were broken with a stick including the skull as they believe that's how the soul is released. I didn't feel it was as respectful as it could have been as tourists walked down to watch the bodies closer and homeless dogs stood gnawing in bones. Rob even saw a bloated body float up from the water as he was on a boat ride to see the sun rise. People and the books have said that Veranasi is a special and spiritual experience but we just didn't get it at all!.

Maybe it's because I'm unwell right now but I don't understand how they can find cows sacred and let them eat plastic and crap off the floors. Many of the people in India litter everywhere and a lot of them spit on the floors alot!! We've seen countless people weeing up walls. ..and some not even up walls. We've even seen a few squatting for number 2s! All in the ""spiritual"" land of veranasi.

On the positive side we did get to drop pretty bowls of flowers and
DSC03330
candles in the Ganges at night and see the colourful and musical ceremony that they do every night there. We also got to go to a silk store where they showed us the difference between Kashmir and fakes. We got to taste lassi for the first time ( sweet yogurtty stuff that you can get flavoured) plus what kind of indian trip would this be without a dodgy stomach.

Anyway I've bored you all enough for one blog! Stay tuned for India part two.

Asia » India » Uttar Pradesh » Varanasi
February 26th 2016
Published: February 25th 2016


Sunrise
Holy man preparing to immerse himself in the Ganges
Author Mark Twain once described Varanasi as being ""older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together"". Varanasi is indeed considered one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, as well as being one of, if not the most, spiritual of all places in India. The city is sacred to Hindus and Jains and even had a large role in the foundation of Buddhism, as Buddha was said to have given his first sermon here. The holy Ganges (Ganga) river flows past this city and many religious pilgrims make their way here to wash in the waters and perform rituals. Some Hindus even travel here to die, believing that by dying in Varanasi and having their ashes spread into the Ganges, the cycle of Samsara (life, death, and reincarnation) will be broken, and they will achieve Moksha (liberation). Many people will agree that Varanasi is like no other place in India, and no other place on the entire planet.

The overnight train left from Khajuraho and we were in some top bunks in sleeper class. Considering that we had been in general class a few days
Bathing in the Ganga
earlier, this was like luxury. Twelve hours later and the train pulled up to Varanasi junction. A rickshaw brought us into the downtown area, and on the way in, I noted that Varanasi seemed to look like pretty much every other big Indian city I had seen. The rickshaw eventually pulled over. The driver stated that we would have to walk the rest of the way as he could not get us any further. The streets had begun to narrow and only pedestrians, motorbikes, and some cows were able to move along the cramped and crowded lanes. I could see holy men, beggars, touts, shop keepers, lay people, and other foreigners all mingling about. It took a little while, but we arrived at ShivaKashi guesthouse, which was within a maze of alley like streets. The owner, Sanju, seemed like quite a character and recounted how once upon a time he had traveled everywhere in India and even many places abroad. We placed our things into our room, cleaned up a little, and then prepared to tackle Varanasi. I was pretty excited. I noticed that the rooftop was caged and was told that the monkeys here were quite plentiful and could
Varanasi
be a nuisance. After some initial frustration at trying to find our way to the ghats along the Ganges, we stopped to have a big Thali at a recommended restaurant. We were pretty stuffed but then walked down the stone stairs towards this mystic river and walked over to the Dasaswamedh Ghat (also known as the Main Ghat) and took in all the life happening around us. It was a photographer's paradise, but just like most of India, photos alone will not do this place justice. Not even words will. You really have to come here on your own to understand why Varanasi is what it is. I'm glad I'd finally done so myself. We walked along the connecting ghats, all the way to Manikarnika Ghat. This is the main cremation ghat where the deceased are brought into the Ganges river, sprinkled with some of its water, then placed on a large wood burning pyre and set ablaze. They burn until only ash is left. The ash is then spread into the holy river. Hundreds of bodies are burnt here a day, and it's quite a spectacle to see. Photography is not allowed out of respect for the ceremonies, and
Holy Man
sadly touts here try to scam you into giving donations, but overall it is so worth it to take a moment and witness what has been going on here for ages and will continue to go on for many more (unless global warming destroys the planet). We then walked back towards the Main Ghat where a nightly Hindu ceremony takes place, and although we both couldn't understand what was happening, it was impressive. People tried to bless us, and multitudes of boats crowded the shore for a look. After this we walked back through the alleys to our guesthouse.

We woke before dawn and went downstairs. Sanju had informed his boatman that we were interested in going on a rowboat to see the sunrise along the Ganges. We walked down the stairs of our Ghat and towards his small wooden boat. He spoke some broken English and brought us out and past the Main Ghat and then continued going towards the main burning ghat. The sun broke through the horizon and then needed to fight through some haze before appearing as the large orange sphere that we all know and love. We had the opportunity to do some photography
Boats
from a much different vantage point. We saw countless people beginning their day by descending the ghats and immersing themselves in the holy waters of the mother river. Varanasi seems to come to life at this point. Our time with the boatman ended, and he dropped us off near the Main Ghat. We then walked back to near our guesthouse and found a pretty cool place to eat breakfast. I was determined to have a more regular eating schedule while in this city. We got back onto the ghats after this and headed west for a bit. It felt pretty incredible to be around so much spirituality.

We then walked towards the Lalita ghat where we were meeting someone. As we approached I looked up and saw his orange robes draped over his small frame and his long white beard. He greeted us warmly and then led us through some narrow lanes back to his place. We were in the home of Raju Baba, a sadhu or Hindu holy man, whom I had met along the Ganges the day earlier. He had been talking to some people along the ghat and then looked at me and asked if I
Portrait
would be willing to jump into the Ganga. I laughed and joked that I might tomorrow. He then asked how I was so sure I would be around to do so! He made the point that life is finite and you never know if there will be a tomorrow. I learned that appreciating the moment is the lesson he was conveying. Unlike most of the sadhus I have tried to interact with in my time in India, Raju Baba or Babaji as we began calling him, spoke English quite well. I had expressed interest in learning more about Hinduism and Sadhus, as well as meditation and yoga. He seemed to genuinely want to teach people things and said we could meet to do so. Being that this is India, I initially asked him about money, and he simply stated that we could donate something if we wanted, but that either way he was happy. An older woman originally from Germany named Gitta lived there and occasionally they had a room available for people who wanted to spend a night or longer. We sat on the rooftop and Babaji prepared some Chai. We spent some time asking him different things about
The Teachings
Hindu gods, the Ganges, and why Sadhus tended to wear the colour orange (also my favourite colour). We continued to talk for a bit and we learned that his father had been his Guru and that he had traveled through India for twenty years as a wandering Baba. Then he got a call to meet with some people from South India who had wanted to converse with him. He left to find them, and we sat on the rooftop just relaxing. Gitta mentioned that he was at the nearby Nepali temple and that we could go and find him since he was taking quite a bit of time to return. We went down and found the temple and he was wandering around, still waiting for his guests. Babaji showed us around the temple and gave us some teachings about them. We encountered the two young Indian friends, who had gotten lost trying to find this location amidst the narrow and mazelike lanes, and then we all returned to Babaji's place. I discovered that the South Indians were photographers, and came from Hyderabad. They spent about 20 minutes speaking with him and then arranged to see him at some point the
Chilling Goat
next day. After they left. Babaji proposed that he would show us some Asanas (Yoga poses). We went into a small room and he demonstrated five different poses, which we then spent the next hour or so practicing. I really think that I'm going to focus a lot more on my flexibility training because I feel so good after doing so. When at home I do my cardio, weight training and climbing but I seem to often neglect my flexibility or just half-ass it at the end of a training session. No more!

While we were practicing yoga, Babaji began preparing a delicious lunch for us. I could smell his Dhal sauce simmering. He claimed that he only used the best of ingredients and joked that he was a certified cook. This lunch was simple, but was one of the best I have ever had here in India. He offered us seconds and thirds and I happily accepted. Stuffed, we got up and helped him with the dishes. We sat on that roof for another while longer, asking more questions about Hinduism. He talked to us a little between the atma (soul) and the chokra (mind), about how to
Solitude
calm both so that one might meditate. During all this, Bev got up and was helping a young boy who kept getting his kite stuck on the side of the wall facing us. Babaji then brought us into his other room and gave us a blessing which included a bracelet and some dye on the forehead to signify the third eye. In Hinduism, the third eye is related to clairvoyance, visions, and the ability see auras. Following this blessing, Babaji took us down the lane to a friend of his who sold various concoctions of spices and oils. Inside his dwelling were several cows. These cows were kept within so that they wouldn't wander through the streets and eat all sorts of garbage, making their milk much purer. We sat in this small room with Babaji and a man introduced himself as an ""aromatherapist"" and offered us chai. He spoke in the slowest and softest way possible, almost as though he was stoned. Bev and I would laugh multiple times over this character and try to imitate his speaking style often. Babaji then took us to see the underground Vishnu temple. Hinduism has hundreds of different gods in this realm
Bird
of perception and Vishnu is one of the main ones. We were explained that this temple was completely flooded with water during the monsoon, when the Ganges rose by many meters. After this, we walked out and Babaji let us know that he'd be going back to his nearby home. We told him that we would be walking eastwards to see all the ghats in that direction that we hadn't had a chance to view yet. We thanked him for the incredible experience and teachings that we were provided and he told me to drop in whenever. It felt so cool having a personal Baba in Varanasi! Armed with cameras, we explored the ghats until sundown; seeing, hearing, and smelling multitudes of stimuli. As the dusk came, we walked back through the narrow and illuminated inner lanes and got lost for a short while. It is so easy, and worthwhile, to lose yourself here (maybe not when it's too late though). We strolled into the guesthouse having been out for about twelve hours. Exhausted but utterly satisfied.

The dawn was just breaking and we were up and out the door, heading down to our ghat and planning on heading
Holy Water
westward. This time is a photographer's best friend and we were intent on catching some of what we were seeing with our own eyes (impossible I know). Countless bathers could be seen. Both men and women washed and beat their clothing and then placed them wherever there was room to dry. Sadhus sat next to their small temples. Some stared out to the river, appearing to be deep in contemplation. Some were doing Yoga, and some meditated. Various people were performing different pujas (rituals). A plethora of boats darted along this famous river. Colours were everywhere. India is definitely the land of colour. I sometimes had to pinch myself, remind myself that I was really here. We stopped along at a place to have breakfast and then continued from the ghats towards a busy road and visited two temples. I was reminded how liberally Indians honk their horns. On the ghats there is no motor traffic, and in the cramped lanes only motorbikes can go (their horns still suck). The day was growing hotter and since we had been walking for almost six hours, we decided that maybe we would head back to the guesthouse and take refuge from the
Cricket Player
sun for a few hours. Certain ghats have more touts and beggars than others so when you're feeling tired, you want to move through them quick. I hopped over some slimy goop on one of the steps. Bev must have stepped on some, and came crashing onto her side. For some reason I instinctively laughed and she was none to pleased. Then she got up, took a step and slipped again! I couldn't help it and laughed again. She was quite irate and part of her was covered in slimy stuff. She was pretty angry at me too. I don't blame her but I really couldn't help it. At least she was alright. She seemed more concerned about her camera. Within five minutes we were laughing hysterically over what had transpired! Bev often jokes that she's clumsy, and this confirmed it! And then India happened. You could be having the worse situation, and then in an instant you can see something incredible that changes everything. In this case, Bev saw a goat wearing a buttoned shirt and was in stitches. She asked the owner why the goat had a shirt on and he matter-of-factly replied ""The goat is cold at
Black & White
night!"" We walked a little more and then saw water buffalo being herded down a ghat and straight into the Ganges. And then their owner began to bathe them! We carried on and then saw the body of a deceased person being brought to the Ganges and then placed on a large pyre. A family member, who we assumed was the oldest son, was having his head shaved then descended to the river and placed Ganga water on himself. They then doused the pyre with flammables and, after a short ritual, it was set on fire as a crowd of people watched. Heavy smoke blew towards me and I had to get out of the way. It was quite something to see. We returned to our guesthouse and took a short nap. Once awake again, we both did some of the Yoga poses and exercises taught to us by Babaji, and I took some body weight exercise as well. Need to stay in shape on the road. We then went out to the Main Ghat walked slightly eastward of it. We sat on one of the steps and watched some young kids playing cricket right there on the ghat. Every
Taking a Moment
now and then different beggars or people trying to sell something would stop by us. One beggar had both his arms amputated at the elbow joints. I tried asking him what had happened to his arms, but he spoke no English. A man who was trying to sell us some stupid trinket at the same time, responded that the beggar had had his arms cut off so he could try to earn more from begging. This, strangely and unfortunately, is more common than one might expect here in the subcontinent. I can't imagine what kind of poverty would drive someone to either mutilate themselves or be mutilated by someone. It's a stark reminder of how lucky some of us are in this world, and how others might have drawn a completely different and much more difficult hand (no pun intended). We then climbed the stairs back into the maze of narrow alleys. We found a cool clothing shop and checked out a few items, agreeing that we would return to it the next day. Fueled by the desire to eat, we returned to our area and tried a good and cheap place near the guesthouse.

We awoke early yet
Baba Raju
again, and descended to the Ganga to observe life. We went about this until we were too hungry and needed to have a breakfast break. While eating, I was facing out at the alley and I saw a familiar figure passing by. I got up and went into the lane, but the person was already gone. After we had finished eating, we walked down a familiar stretch of alley. I looked to my left and confirmed that I had seen what I thought I had seen. Ricky, whom I had met back in Udaipur, was sitting in a restaurant terrace with some friends, and somehow, we had run into each other here in Varanasi about 1130 km away from when we had first met! We didn't have long to chat because Bev and I were on our way to do some Yoga, but I told him I would get in contact with him later. We walked one ghat west of where we had been. Facing the river was Siddarth Yoga center, taught by Yogi Siddarth. We had heard some good things about this place and decided to give it a go. Considering how I wanted to become more flexible, for
Washing the Animals
the time being I was actually following through. The lesson took place with an incredible view of the Ganga and for two hours we did Asanas (poses) and Pranayamas (breathing exercises) and then completed with incredible and synchronized OM chants. I felt so good after that.

Bev was running low on time now. She had managed to get to India using standby tickets and now she had the opportunity to try for a flight leaving Delhi on this very night. She had to be back to work in a few days and it was stressful trying to get home this way, but it was the only way she could have afforded to do so. The way back through one of the alleys, we saw a covered body of a deceased being wheeled past on a wooden wagon. We made a quick stop back to the guesthouse, then went out and found a nice clothing and fabrics shop nearby. We both bought a few items and I ended up sending back most of my stuff with her. I had to do my best to keep my pack as light as possible. The shopkeeper was really pleasant and was not trying
Portrait
to swindle or pressure us. This was a nice change from the general shopping experience in India. We then stopped by at one of our ""regular"" restaurants and each ordered a special thali, as the Yoga had made us famished. Racing back to our room, Bev packed up all her stuff and then we walked out to one of the busier streets where a taxi was waiting to bring her to the airport. She would be flying from here to Delhi, and hoped she was able to get on her flight home. We wished each other well, and then she was off. I realized we traveled really well together, rarely having any spats or disagreements and getting along most of the time. I can't say that would happen with many of the people I know from back home. I think we both had some life changing experiences thanks to India.

I was back at the guesthouse and decided to take the rest of the afternoon easy. In the evening, I met up with Ricky and some friends of his who were staying in a guesthouse just down the lane from mine. When I walked in and went up to
Sadhus
their room, they were in the midst of practicing Salsa dance and I figured they were drunk or stoned or both. It was hilarious! Ricky told me some tales from the past few weeks and I did the same. I met a few other travelers who were staying in the guesthouse, and we hung out for a bit. Then the boys announced they had procured fireworks and were keen on launching them from the rooftop. I had already done this once with Ricky back in Udaipur and couldn't wait to try it again. These fireworks seemed a little flimsy however and didn't really explode in the air. We launched a few and then Ricky lit one that careened over and towards one of the adjacent buildings. This resulted in a pack of dogs freaking out below and local residents yelling. We decided that our firework show was done and descended back down. Not the smartest thing to be doing but I'm never going to claim I always act in the smartest way.

I slept in a bit longer than usual the next day, feeling tired after having packed so much in on the previous days. I leisurely woke up,
Bathing
did some exercises and yoga, then I went out to find some food. After that, I walked along the ghats and found a shady spot to read my book (a Sadhu book at that!). I tried meditating too and after that I walked down to the Ganga and waded my legs into the polluted water. When in Rome I figured plus I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I returned to the guesthouse and tried to figure out some stuff for the next part of my trip, then fell asleep for a while. My window was open and I awoke seeing monkeys trying to get past the bars and into my room. I went back down to the ghats, intent on doing some more photography. I sat for a bit with a group of Sadhus in front of a Hanuman temple who were passing around a chillum. Then I walked along past the Main Ghat and returned to the Lalita ghat, where Babaji resided. I figured I would pop in and see what he was up to. As I approached his dwelling, I saw him strolling down the lane. He was happy to see me and invited
Along the Main Ghat
me to his place for some chai. As he prepared some chai for me with his delicious masala, we chatted about life and discussed chokra. He asked how my Yoga Asanas were going, and I replied that they were coming along slowly but steadily. We then walked down to the Ganga and sat there, silently watching all sorts of people walk past. People watching can be amazing and I highly recommend you give it a try when in Varanasi. For a while, he sang some Hindu song, becoming quite loud at times. A young Korean traveler approached us and gave Babaji some charras. He wasn't wrong to do so as many Sadhus do smoke charras for spiritual vision, but Babaji had given up smoking many years ago. The south Korean guy, named Cho, had acquired it through a friend but wasn't too fond of them either. Babaji kept joking that he would sell them back to Cho for one thousand rupees. Cho's English was passable but he often became confused by Babaji's sarcasm. I realized that Babaji was a pretty eccentric guy. He handed the charras to me after he smelled them, stating they were good quality. I accepted them.
Shiva
We invited Cho to come along and descended to the lower Vishnu temple and Babaji blessed us and gave us our third eyes. We then watched boats go by for a while. The experience was serene. After that we walked to one of the many markets in the area, and I bought some fruit for Baba before we parted ways. I walked back with Cho, as he was actually staying at the same guesthouse as Ricky, and we walked through the evening ceremony at the Main Ghat that was being viewed by hundreds.

Bright and early yet again, but I had to get the most out of my final day here in this mystical place. I walked down the ghat and then made the short journey to Siddarth's yoga studio. Another two hours of yoga while looking out at the Ganges was a great way to get things going. Siddarth demonstrated some advanced poses and his balance seemed impeccable. He has been practicing Yoga since childhood, and teaching for the last fourteen years. I then went to what had become my regular breakfast place to eat. Once back at the guesthouse, I packed up my stuff and prepared to
Happy Goats
check out. Although my train from Varanasi was only much later, the dreaded check out time had come. I placed all my things of in storage and then made my way to Lalita ghat. Babaji had invited me to his place for lunch. Cho had been invited too, and both of them were already in front of Lalita ghat when I arrived. We went back to his place and Gitta was in the kitchen preparing some food. Whatever it was, it smelt really good. We sat on the floor and were served a delicious looking thali, which consisted of some rice, bean sauce, potatoes in spices, and a cabbage salad. This thali was now one of the best I've had. I ate quickly and then walked downstairs were I had arranged to meet a man named Tarak in a music shop right below Babaji's place. Tarak came from a musical family and was an accomplished performance player and master of Indian musical instrument called the sitar. The sitar is a stringed instrument that dates back several hundred years in this region. I play a lot of guitar back home and have been fortunate so far in my trip to have
On the River
been able to run into many guitars and keep my musical appetite sated. I'm seriously considering bringing a travel guitar along for my next trip. It would be blasphemous for me to have traveled through India and not try to sitar at least once! My lesson began and Tarak proved to be a good teacher, explaining some of the main concepts in a concise way. I picked it up pretty quickly due to my competency on guitar and loved the sound of this instrument. My lesson went well and I promised that the next time I go to Varanasi, I'm definitely going to be looking him up. I went back up to Babaji's place and we all had chai and then sat around for a while. I watched monkeys jump from rooftop to rooftop and observed a young boy flying his kite around. We finally bid farewell to Babaji and I thanked him for the hospitality and company. I promised him I would send him a cool picture I took of him when I had the chance. Babaji went to sit by the Ganga, as he always did at this time, He seemed to stare out at everything and nothing.
Babaji and Me
I walked back with Cho and we explored more of the ghat front, the final time for me. We walked to one of the burning ghats and sat and watched for a little bit. I returned to my guesthouse and settled things with Sanju. I still had a few hours to kill. A meal a little later on and a quiet stroll along the narrow lanes, and then I was off towards the station.

Varanasi will always remain a special place to me. Amidst the chaos and cacauphony of life, there is a serenity to be found here unlike anything I know or can describe. The sobering reminder of how finite existence can be is only a short glance away towards one of the burning ghats. Many things are said of Varanasi; I would say that the soul of India resides right here. The oldest city in the world continues to amaze and I will absolutely return here once again.

Khajuraho Temple
I had an hour free yesterday afternoon and wrote a detailed description of activities from Thursday morning to Friday afternoon. I clicked Save just as the Internet shut down and my entire blog disappeared! VERY FRUSTRATING! The Internet then didn't work last night so I'll have to do an abbreviated version while waiting in the lobby for breakfast to open.

Thursday morning we began the day at the temples of Khajuraho, built by the Chandelas in the 10th century. Many temples were destroyed when the Mughais invaded (and ruled much of India until the British), but these apparently were missed because of their relatively remote location. They were discovered by British archeologists in the 1800's who were likely rather shocked by the erotic sculptures. There are thousands of scenes depicted on just the 9 temples we saw. Our guide says there are 84 positions depicted....and I'm not talking about yoga, though many positions in these scenes have are yoga positions and Khujaraho is a center for yoga practice.

In the afternoon we had a short flight to Varanasi from the very small airport in Khujaraho. Security was just as tight there as it was in Delhi and Jaipur. My
Sculpture on a Khajuraho Temple
backpack was pulled and the guy kept insisting I had scissors. After taking everything out and running things through separately he still kept asking for scissor. Finally he opened my shower bag and sure enough, he found some tiny scissors that come with the free sewing kits you get in hotels. I sure was embarassed! I also feel very safe flying in India!

We spent the evening in Varanasi on a boat on the River Ganga (Ganges to us), a sacred river to Hindus known as Mother Ganga. Coming to Varanasi to bathe is a pilgrimage for Hindus comparable to going to Mecca for Muslims. it is the ultimate wish for Hindus to be cremated in Varanasi and have their ashes put in river. We saw many cremations going on in the ghats that line the banks of the river. Each night priests to a ceremoney j own as Aarti, where thousands of lights are sent floating down the river. It was an inspiring and amazing evening.

The next morning we arrived at the river before dawn where we watched the priests greet the sun and the thousands of pilgrims bathing in the River. We went down the
Flower Building on the Ganges
river in a rowboat and ended with a priest performing a Hindu ritual on the boat where we honored departed lover ones.

We had a yoga class in the afternoon, a music demonstration and a fascinating discussion with our guide of the history of the India/Pakistan conflicts .

Off to Delhi today and will begin the very long trek home at 3:30 a.m. Tomorrow!

Taj Mahal in the grey morning
Agra, Taj Mahal and all in the rain! What is going on?

The Thomas weather curse strikes. Profuse apologies from the Indians that it is raining today, though it never rains in India in February.....the rain hammers down as we head to the Taj Mahal in darkness at 6am. We get to the East Gate to find there is a power cut in the ticket office. Fortunately it is restored and armed with tickets we set off on the short walk to the actual East Gate entrance to the Taj Mahal precincts. Annoyingly there is a massive queue for the foreigners who have paid 750 rupees and none for the Indians who have paid 25 rupees.

Security negotiated past the men with machine guns and we are in the gardens before the main gateway to the garden which is itself a magnificent octagonal structure in red sandstone faced in black and white marble inlay.

The usual first breathtaking view of the Mausoleum is spoilt by the drizzle and the grey background of the sky against which the Taj seems to dissolve in the thin mist. The scaffolding on three of the four flanking minarets does not help. Anyway,
Fighting monkeys
we are here so we set off on the long walk to the Mausoleum, eschewing the naff “Princess Di” photo on the stone bench. Some Americans have chosen to talk a selfie using their offensive selfie stick on a bench 200 yards short of the real thing while declaring this is where “that Princess sat looking sad”. Idiots....

Meanwhile, sheltering from the rain in a corner of the Taj is a granny in a sari topped off with a black puffa jacket inscribed on the back with the words ‘Born to kill’ above a picture of a skull. Really?

To the side of the Taj we were disturbed by a sound of crashing, which came from a troop of monkeys who were fighting each other, scrambling up and down the scaffolding and knocking over everything in sight. Fun to watch, but best avoided as they can carry rabies and looked to have very sharp teeth!

The Mausoleum, to recount the story, was built by Emperor Shan Jehan for his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died in 1631 giving birth to his fourteenth child. The cost of the structure commissioned by the pining Emperor nearly bankrupted the Mughals. The
Agra fort
finest craftsmen were brought from Persia, Italy and countries far and wide to use the finest materials to build the Taj.

Even this, the finest monument in India, is suffering the ravages of pollution and general degradation. What looks perfect from a distance reveals cracks and damage when you get up close. Upkeep is a continual battle.

We return eventually to the hotel for a rest and then off to the Red Fort, where the sky continues to be grey and the rain falls intermittently. A guide offers his services. “No thank you” Sara says pleasantly. “But madam you cannot possibly know what is about the fort without a guide”. He has gone too far. Sara fixes him with The Stare. “We have been here before and my husband is a student of Indian history. Now go away”. That does the trick.

The Red Fort was for many centuries the capital of first the Lodhi sultans who ruled India before being defeated by the first Mughal Emperor Babur in 1526, and then of the Mughals themselves. The present defensive walls were built by Akbar during his reign (1556 to 1605) and the later white marble buildings were
Itmad-ud-Daula tomb
added later by Jehangir and Shah Jehan. Shan Jehan was overthrown by his son, the pious and austere Aurangzeb in 1658 and he was then imprisoned in the Fort until his death in 1666. The buildings are impressive and in a good state of repair, though unfortunately a large part of the fort cannot be seen as it is an army barracks. Why? Could they not keep the troops somewhere else?

A break over lunch and we drive to the Tomb of Itamad ud Daula, the tomb of the father of Nur Jahan who was the wife of Emperor Jehangir. It is a beautiful but small white marble structure with exquisite inlay work outside and delicate wall paintings of fruit and flower motifs within. All lovingly restored and maintained. Some particularly ignorant East India Company cavalry officers had done their bit for culturual appreciation in the 18th century when they decided to use the tomb as a stable and painted over the wall paintings with whitewash. We all make mistakes I suppose.

Next stop is the Metab Bagh, a massive garden on the opposite bank of the Yamuna to the Taj, laid out by Shah Jehan so he
Taj Mahal from Metab Bagh across the Yamuna
could view the Taj. It is slowly being replanted to bring it back to its former glory.

Then on to the Chini Ka Rausa, a monument David had read about, a tomb built for the Persian born prime minister of Shah Jehan (Persians were very popular in Mughal India as they were seen as cultured and educated, despite being Shia Muslims rather than Sunni as the Mughals were. Persian was also the courtly language of the Mughals and their nobles). The mausoleum is in the middle of a market garden, no one goes there and there is a grizzled retainer who shows you round for a few rupees. There is beautiful blue tile inlay on the outside, and exquisite inlay work inside in the course of restoration. A hidden gem and the sort of thing we love finding in India.



Dinner at the Marriott. We were expecting to quietly enjoy the Indian buffet which looked very promising. Chef Ricky himself appeared and showed us this creations. We started with a selection of Indian street food, refined for fine dining and had just moved on to the main course when the Hordes of Nippon appear. 150 of
Chini ka Rauza exterior tiles
them in one tour group. They have apparently refused to be told what any of the food is and determinedly set about the buffet adding to one plate whatever they fancy. Two elderly Japanese dressed in full trekking kit and face masks plonk themselves down on our table without so much as a by your leave. David is tempted to say “piss off” but instead gives them a polite “good evening” in his poshest English which gains no response. They have brought their own flask of drink and return from the buffet with a plate of, well, everything. We particularly admired the naan bread sandwich filled with noodles with the obvious accompaniment of mango ice cream and chocolate cake. Madam has salad, bread rolls, curried mushrooms and papaya on her plate and possibly some soup poured over for good measure. A young Japanese couple behind us who are clearly better travelled are pissing themselves with amusement at the antics of their countrymen. And where did the twenty Buddhist monks come from?? The Indian staff keep coming over to us to tell us what further combinations the tour party are eating. Ricky the chef tells us that the tour leader had
Chattri at the Taj
earlier presented the chefs with a supply of noodles and sachets of flavouring, with precise instructions on how to cook them. Absolutely hilarious.

Early morning in Kolodeo
Unlike yesterday, today has been the epitome of a perfect day on holiday.

We were up early for a quick breakfast before setting off by rickshaw to the Keoladao National Park. It used to be the Maharajah’s hunting grounds and is now a wildlife sanctuary with a huge variety of birds. Apparently there are fewer species than there used to be, because the government diverted the water to supply people, meaning the lake is now much smaller, but it still looked pretty good to us. It was cool but not cold and incredibly peaceful. There weren’t many other visitors when we set off at 7am, though those who had made it out early all seemed to be serious Indian twitchers with massive telephoto lenses playing the game of ‘mine’s bigger than yours’. David pointed out they were mostly Canon prime lenses between 400 and 600mm should you care about such things. And you have to have the proper camouflage cover for it and a big tripod. And of course the camouflage kits so you look like an SAS trooper. You also have to have a propensity to sit for an hour taking thousands of photos of one bird with your
Cormorant
camera on seven frames a second.

Our rickshaw driver (or should that be pedaller) was great at spotting birds that would have passed us by, and naming them, though we now can’t remember the names of most of what we saw. The painted storks and Sarus cranes though were amazing. The cranes are the tallest flying birds in the world at up to 6ft high. They mate for life and are so desolated by the death of their mate that they sometimes starve themselves to death. We weren’t close enough to fully appreciate their height but they did look majestic. The best sight of the day was a young stork about 3 ft tall standing in the road, with a large fish in its beak. It could not work out how to swallow the fish, so kept moving it around in its beak until finally it succeeded.

After three hours, we returned to the hotel, packed up and set off to visit Lohargarh fort in the nearby town of Bharatpur. Most of the outer walls have vanished but the inner walls still stand high above the town, surrounded by a moat. The fort was captured by Lord Lake
Painted stork
in 1805 from the pesky Marathas. Inside, there was a bustling town within a town, with shops and homes. We’d been told the museum was closed on Fridays but in fact it was not only open but free. It was in a beautiful seventeenth century palace. The actual museum displays were dire – mangy stuffed animals, random pieces of pottery, and some cabinets that were so badly lit we couldn’t work out what was in them! We encountered the first school party of the trip, who literally mobbed us in their excitement. Twenty photos and forty handshakes later we escaped into the hammam only to be greeted by another group of children!

Once done, we headed for Agra, stopping on the way to revisit Akbar’s tomb in Sikandra. Akbar was the third and greatest Mughal Emperor who ruled from 1556 to 1605. He started the design and building of the tomb himself but it was completed by his son Jehangir. The south gateway where you enter is a magnificent construction in red sandstone faced and decorated in white and black marble. The tomb itself is set in centre of a chargbagh garden – the classic moghul garden design divided
Baby stork with catch
into four equal squares with the tomb in the centre. It is another fine structure with the cenotaph of the Emperor in the centre, in a chamber reached by a long passageway. After the Mughal Empire declined in the 18th century, the tomb was ransacked and the body taken away and lost. And as with so many monuments in India, it faces a continual battle against the degradations of the weather and pollution, and a limited budget for repairs. India often seems to prefer spending its resources on things other than the maintenance of the past, a sad state of affairs in a country with an unbelievable quantity and variety of monuments.



By now overheated, we proceeded to the Marriott. Oh yes, this is more like it. Most pleasant!

Taj Mahal
We arrived in Agra on the evening of the 15th and checked into another amazing hotel before heading out for our first glimpse of the Taj Mahal. We saw it from the back at sunset which was quite impressive but we knew it was only a taste of what was to come. We had a wake-up call at 5 a.m. yesterday morning, so we could be at the front of the line when the gates opened at sunrise. Our guide told us to leave all bags on the bus so we could avoid the bag security and just go through the body scan and pat down. We were among the first people to walk onto the grounds.....It was truly amazing!!! it was incredible to stand in front of it and for the first 10 minutes, to almost feel like you were there with only a private party. it is mind boggling to know that this was built just because some guy wanted to honor his favorite wife.....and no one has ever lived there!

Almost as impressive as the Taj Majal was the Agra Fort. This palace/fort made every palace Ive ever seen very modest...it covers 90 acres! The Agra fort
Taj Majal Group pic
was built by the Mughals who ruled a northern India from the early 16th century until the consolidation by the British colonial rule in the early 1800s. There was beautiful artistry throughout. It also included apartments for 2000 concubines!

One very moving experience in Agra was a stop at the Sheroes Hangout. This is a coffee shop that is run by women who have been victims of acid attacks. We met some very inspiring women who have come forward to fight to stop the sale of hydrochloric acid and help women victims of these horrific attacks. We met the man who is a journalist, who helped get the movement started and is now married to one of the victims who is a spokesperson for the movement. Our whole group left in awe of the strength of these women who have faced such horrors.

Yesterday afternoon I chose to skip the demonstration of the craft of marble inlay and the chance to spend big bucks on marble inlaid elephants, plates or even tables. Instead I returned to the hotel and had a hand and foot massage!

Today was another early morning start. We left the hotel at 7
Sheroes Group Picture
a.m. to catch a train to Jhansi (2 1/2 hours)where we then got on our bus for the long (5hours)and bumpy ride to Khajuraho. It was the first time that I was really tired of being in the bus....though I still enjoyed seeing all the small villages and the people. We have a new bus and bus driver.....this one is just as good as the other one...I still don't understand how they manage to speed through these crowded narrow roads. I can't sit at the front of the bus and watch the oncoming traffic....too scary!

Tomorrow morning we visit the 10th century temples in the town before flying to Varanasi.

Taj Mahal
Geo: 26.9847, 78.1019

Early start again with 8am leave. Slow trip out of Delhi, so much traffic and congestion. Cars, tucks, bikes, camels, cows & dogs all share the road, everything is overloaded. Makes for slow & interesting? trip, amazing there are no accidents and everyone just expects it. No road rules, our drive on the horn all the time. Finally made the freeway and sped up but still arrived late to Agra at 1pm.

Checked into Jaypee hotel, not as good as Trident but big rooms. Our rooms miles away from Reception & dining room, upstairs, along corridors then downstairs again, easy to get lost. Quick chinese lunch then off to Red Fort.

Red Fort, constructed in 1648 by the fifth Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, is named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone and is adjacent to the older Salimgarh Fort, built in 1546. The Red Fort was the residence of the Mughal emperor of India for nearly 200 years, until 1857. Very impressive built by true craftsmen, ovelooking the Taj Mahal on the river. Spent 1.5 hours walking around, very interesting the history.

Then to Taj Mahal which is stunning. Everyone really looking
Flower Garland on arrival at Jaypee Hotel
forward to this, should be a real highlight. Entry is very secure with patdowns & full search of handbags etc which took some time. Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Beautifully built, perfectly symmetrical with 4 minarets on each corner of the podium, with lots of history and stories but just amazing to see. Quite crowded but we were able to walk around, up onto the podium then inside. Inside not do impressive, not much natural light with 2 tombs laid out (his & hers). Presently cleaning the minarets, so scaffolding spoiling the view but still very impressive. Found a seat to sit in the front garden and watch as the sun set over the Taj Mahal, unfortunately hazy so not good light.

Back to hotel for buffet dinner, just acceptable, not much choice but filled us up.
Long day so off to bed, for another early start tomorrow for Jaipur.

Beautiful
Considering that one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, the Taj Mahal, is situated in Agra, this means that Agra is one of the most visited of all destinations here in India. Definitely a must for any first timer to India, although many a traveler have told me not to stick around the city of Agra itself for too long. We took an evening train from Jaipur, and I sat next to a family from Ajmer on their way to Agra for a wedding. The daughter spoke English quite well, and we spoke for a good part of the trip. Plenty of questions were put forth to me regarding life in Canada, even questions such as my yearly salary, which is not taboo as it is back home to be asked. I in turn asked plenty of questions about Indian life and customs. Riding the rails in a foreign country is a great way to really get to know some of the locals.

The train arrived quite late in the evening and after negotiating with several tuk-tuk's, we managed to find one that was able to bring us to our hostel, only 500m away from the famous Taj
The real thing!
Mahal. Bev and I had decided that we would attempt to see this wonder of the world for sunrise, despite our mutual hatred for being awake so early. We went to sleep almost immediately. It felt like an instant, but I was awoken by my alarm clock. We got up, and in fact many others at the hostel seemed to be having a similar idea. We first needed to walk to the ticket counter, which was a few hundred metres in the opposite direction. Plenty of touts approached us on the way there. Once we had our ticket, we walked towards the Taj Mahal east gate. Plenty more touts accosted us as we walked. I had already decided that I didn't have a good feel for this city. We waited in the queue and were finally allowed in as the sun was creeping up. It's not everyday that you get to see a wonder of the world, but when I first glimpsed the Taj, I was awestruck. It definitely lived up to the hype. The early morning sun cast a soft and beautiful glow on the building. After taking the almost required photo ops, we then got distracted by some
Rose Ringed Parakeet
birds and attempted to take their photos. We took our time and walked all around the Taj and eventually walked inside the mausoleum, where the third wife of Shah Jahan is buried, and the reasoning for this structure that was completed by him in 1653. Towards the end of our stay there, we sat on a bench and just stared off at the magnificence.

We walked back to the hostel much later than expected, and got a late breakfast. Then I interacted with some of the other hostel folk, and played guitar with a German guy. I played the melody while he was on the rythm. It was still the early afternoon at this point, but Bev and I were wondering what else to do while in this town. We decided that we would take the half hour walk from the hostel to the Agra Fort, also labeled as a Unesco World Heritage site. We almost gave this one a miss for stupid reasons, but I'm so happy we didn't because it was almost as impressive as the Taj itself. The outer walls consisted of red sandstone while some of the inner structures were made of marble. It was
Agra Fort
quite large although part of it was under renovation when we were there. As we walked along, we met a security guard who placed some crushed cookie or cracker powder in our hands and whistled over some chipmunks who ate out of our hands. Of course he asked for a few rupees for this ""service"", sadly all too common in this part of India. It always makes me wonder who is being genuinely kind and who is looking for some kind of payday. We spent the afternoon exploring the rest of the fort and taking some snaps. One of the balconies allowed us to see the Taj in the distance. As the afternoon was getting late, we exited the fort and used a rickshaw to get back to the Taj Mahal east gate. From there we walked towards the Yamuna river to get a glimpse of the Taj from the outside for the sunset. It wasn't the best view, but was still pretty nice to see. I couldn't believe how a city like Agra had three Unesco World Heritage sites, yet looked and smelt like a complete dump. The trash along the river right behind the Taj was dense and
The Best of Friends
the river itself was practically black. We ran into some other people at our hostel there and then went to a nearby restaurant to have thali. I had hardly eaten all day so I ate quite a bit at that moment. When we got back to the hostel, I chilled out on my bed but noticed that I was quite bloated and felt off. As the hours progressed, I didn't feel anywhere near 100% but hoped that this feeling would pass. I was keeping my fingers crossed as I had an early train to catch the next morning. Getting a case of Delhi Belly was the last thing I needed right now.

Went to NewDelhi railway station in plenty of time to make sure I knew where to get train and its a good job I did. Firstly my train seemed to be noticeably absent from the deoartures board so I asked at enquiries ( braving the scrum lol ) and found my train was going from platform 15. TyoicallyI was neareast platform one . So got over long bridge , down onto platform where I found my carriage quite easily. Had a side lower berth in the AC2 class.

On the platform I bought some bananas and oranges for the journey and settled down into my seat.

Left on time but onky had about half an hour before it got dark and couldn't se any more so resorted to playing games on the tablet and bought water and crisps from the train vendors.

Decided to turn myseat into sleeping bunk and lay down. This is when I realised my mistake with seat selection. The sleeping berth had gap between the 2 cushions that was most uncomfortable . And beside I was on a side lower everytime someone got on or off train I ended up getting whacked by their luggage


Eventually I dozed off helped by Pink Floyd on the ipod but didnt have a restful sleep and was awake far too early .As soon as it git light I converted bunk back to seat and looked out of window. Was gasping for a cup of tea but cant drink the Indian chai as far too sweet for me so made do with water

We pulled into Varanasi Jct 5 mins early and I was immediately surrounded by tuktuk and rickshaw drivers.

I chose an elderly rickshaw driver who had quoted me 100 rupees to Assi Ghat I felt bad as I hadnt realised it was quite so far for this old guy to cycle through the traffic. But he made it and dropped me a few meters from Assi Ghat. I walked down to the steps and saw the Ganges and was filled with happiness


After chilling there for 20 mins and managing to fob off many drivers guides and touts I decided to make my was to my guesthoude which I knew was 100 meters away. Could I find it? Oh no not a chance. In the end a shopkeeoers heard me asking for directions and phoned the owner for me. Within 5 mins Naveen came and collevted me from the shop and walked me all of 50 yards to the guesthoude where he kindly made me a much needed black tea

TAJ MAHAL AT SUNRISE
You magnificent thing!
Left Jaipur by 8.10a.m. and on the road for the long drive to Agra. Enroute we took an unplanned stop in Abhaneri, just a few kilometres off our route, someone on our tour asked Braham if we could go and see it .....so glad he suggested it...it was a great little surprise and free! It is one of the oldest step wells in Rajasthan, it was built during 8th and 9th century it is 19.5 metres deep and the most amazing maze of steps on three sides ....it is absolutely gi-normous! It is hard to describe and the photos do not do it justice. It has some of the most beautiful carvings that we have seen on our trip so far, and quite different. It is in a very small village but just so impressive. We then pressed on towards Agra and visited the huge muslim temple just outside Agra, an amazing site to see, and yes John is coping with the Muslim stuff quite well!! Only hiccup we have had, staying at Sheraton 4 Points in Agra and after third room got it lucky....damp and peeling walls in two rooms and they smelt musty and water damaged...they were very accommodating....UPGRADED
TAJ MAHAL
Just before sunset, the other side of the river behind the Taj
ROOM, FREE MINI BAR AND FREE INTERNET.. so at least they acknowledged their room was crap! Anyway all good eventually and then we headed out of the hotel for dinner...a little bit Indianed out so went to a lovely restaurant a block or so from the hotel Manchurian Chinese...delicious and a couple of beers to wash it all down.

MONDAY

Up before dawn to be at the Taj Mahal for sunrise, very foggy or smoggy???!!, so pics not great. When we turned the corner and saw this magnificent site we had goosebumps, WOW! It is so much bigger than what we imagined, arrived there at about 6.50a.m. and left around 9.30, it is a huge site with manicured gardens. Just so hard to believe it was built in 1630 by the King to remember his beautiful wife who died giving birth to their 14th child at aged 39, what a monument to remember his wife by!!!! It took 22 years to build and when finished he cut off the hands of all the artists so they could replicate this anywhere else....mmmm nice type!!! The poms have a lot to answer for, stealing all the gold, diamonds and other
TAJ MAHAL
Magnificent detail!
precious stones off the Taj and many other places, they even burnt the gold art work that they couldn't scrape off and put flame to it to melt it off!!! Back to hotel for breaky and hydrate and off out again to the Red Fort. There are only 18 of us on this tour but truly it is like rounding up a mob of goldfish in a huge fish tank sometimes...our guide has his work cut out ""keep with the group""!! Only lost someone once! Off to the Red Fort which was not on our itinerary either, I am so glad Braham decided to take us here, magnificent! Built on 42 acres made of huge bricks of red sandstone with a moat built around filled with crocodiles, started being built in the 10th century and truly is an architectural genius, when you think almost 1,000 years ago, they knew how to get drainage, security, lifestyle and water storage, all of things we find a bit challenging these days. We spent over two hours here and could have spent more time. Late afternoon has time free but we had researched a few restaurants and decided to hit ""Pinch of Spice"", what
TAJ MAHAL
Truly stunning!
a sensational place, equal Indians and Westerners eating here and the food was to die for! Next table was inspector of police in Agra, had a nice chat regarding our cricket teams! A great mix of Chinese (more Manchurian) and Indian - had wonderful Momos and some Indian dishes, everything was a taste sensation including the peanuts they served with drinks, spiced up with some Indian Spices - spent 3 hours here just kicking back from the hectic few days we have had before. Then walked the 1.5klms back to the hotel. A wonderful Indian trip is coming to an end, back to Delhi tomorrow for a shopping tour in the arvo - mainly to the Spice Market - then home Wednesday.

Agra fort
We'd planned a bit of luxury for Agra having found a very good deal at a new Marriott - not the kind of place we would normally choose to stay but it was less than the price of a very ordinary B & B in the Dales and we thought that we might benefit from a bit of pampering. So, a 6am train from New Delhi station whisked us out of Delhi....then slowed down due to thick fog and arrived into Agra about an hour late! Still, we were at the hotel by 9.30am so expected to have to wait to check in but the room was already available so we indulged ourselves for a few hours with proper coffee, showers and bathrobes!

But we couldn't just sit in the hotel so after lunch we walked out to the main road to pick up a tuk-tuk rather getting them to call us a car (we're probably the only people staying there who didn't go everywhere by car and we were certainly the only people staying there with backpacks that we saw!). We started at Agra fort, a huge and beautiful fort which also gave us our first view of the
Taj Mahal from Agra fort
Taj at the other side of Agra - wow! From there we took another tuk-tuk across the river to see the Baby Taj - an earlier mausoleum, smaller than the Taj but with the most amazing intricately carved marble. The tuk-tuk driver talked us into going to Mehtab Bagh, the gardens across from the Taj which are supposed to give great sunset views. While there's a good view of the Taj, the sun sets in the wrong place for it to really light up the marble and for us it was getting quite hazy so the sun wasn't really reaching the building. Still, it was good to see it from a different place although it was clear from there that there was scaffolding on 2 of the 4 towers in each corner....why does that always happen when you're looking for the perfect picture!?

So, more indulgence with dinner back at the hotel but back in the room we could hear the music from the party downstairs really loudly. After phone calls, trips to reception and endless fobbing off, it was probably about midnight when the music quietened down and we got some sleep. At breakfast it seemed we'd made
Baby Taj
a name for ourselves as one of the waiting staff apologised for the noise and hoped we'd managed to sleep when it finished. I asked him if there were any more parties in the hotel for the next couple of nights and he said that there weren't so it should be quiet - phew!

We'd originally planned to do sunrise at the Taj that day but every morning for a week or so had been thick fog and the staff said that it would just not be worth it. So, after a leisurely (and huge!) breakfast we did the tuk-tuk thing again. He wanted to take us to the East gate which was closer but we had got the impression it was quite busy with groups from the big hotels so we made him take us to the South gate. This turned out to be incredibly quiet and we walked straight through. There's another huge red sandstone gate to go through and then, there it is - spectacular. It's impossible to describe such an iconic building without using clichés or repeating all the things that people have said before. When asking people for tips on where to go they
Taj Mahal from Mehtab Bagh
had all said the Taj Mahal and I would definitely agree. We spent a good couple of hours wandering around and taking photos and then sat in the sun looking at it for a while. We only got asked to have our photo taken with one group in the whole time which was also a bit of a relief!

From there, we found our way through the narrow streets just outside the gate to a guesthouse which had a rooftop restaurant overlooking the Taj. It's a fantastic view but amazing that the rooftops between there and the Taj have not been taken over as viewing points. More veggie curry then back to the hotel for coffee and cake - yum!

Later that afternoon we set off with a guide, Sandeep, for a walking tour of some of the more earthy parts of Agra. Sandeep is a history graduate and freelance guide and he was interesting and enthusiastic about his country and its history and culture. He took us past the fort to Agra fort station, the first one built by the Brits in Agra, and then across to the cities central mosque where the caretaker showed us around.
Taj Mahal
From there we walked into the bazaar and deep into narrow winding streets, came to a very old Hindu temple with the god down the stairs from the street, almost in a basement. As with all temples, we took off shoes and spent about 15 minutes inside with Sandeep telling us things about the temple and Hindu gods. When we came out, mine and Sandeep's shoes had been moved onto a plastic sheet but Hugh's were nowhere to be seen. Sandeep caused a big fuss with the people working at the temple and suddenly Hugh's socks appeared on the floor next to him but the shoes never appeared. These were his big walking shoes so probably looked quite valuable though at size 11 would not fit anybody in India! We eventually had to accept that they'd gone so H put his socks back on to wind our way out of the alleys so we could pick up a tuk-tuk. We tried to buy a pair of flip-flops just to get him home but size 10 was their maximum and his heels were falling off the back.

Sandeep called our cycle rickshaw guys to pick us up and out of
Taj Mahal
the bazaar we transferred to a taxi. Sandeep was clearly very upset with what had happened and also very embarrassed. He had been in touch with the owners of the business that had organised this for us and they asked to speak to us on the phone. They were very apologetic and said that we shouldn't pay anything for the tour and could they arrange for us to be taken to some sports shops the following day to try to replace the shoes. I explained that we would need an outdoor clothing shop and they agreed that there probably wasn't somewhere in Agra, particularly with large enough shoes. We were heading back to Delhi in a couple of days so said that we would try there - H had enough with him to manage. I got the impression they were holding Sandeep responsible as they suggested he should have ensured that somebody was lined up to keep an eye on the shoes but it's hard to be angry with anybody except the person that took them and even then, in the area we were in, I can see that expensive looking shoes would attract attention.

So, back into the
Taj Mahal
hotel and H had to walk through reception in his socks...just making ourselves a bit more conspicuous!

It was then that things really started to go wrong at the hotel as a cold shower was followed by an engineer coming and going from our room and leaving the tap and shower running on full. He kept telling us it was fixed when it wasn't and after we'd been listening to the running water for 20 minutes and somebody turning up to clean up the bathroom after the engineer, I ended up going down to reception to tell them it wasn't fixed. To cut a long story short, we turned all the taps off again when we couldn't wait any longer for dinner and told them at reception again. We also asked about the music that we could already hear playing in our room because we had been told that there weren't any parties that night. Turned out there was, a big one, and outside this time. The guy on reception tried to assure me that it was around the other side of the building so we wouldn't hear it but he couldn't tell me when the water would be
Fatehpur
fixed. Getting very frustrated with people not telling me the truth I asked to speak to the manager on duty who eventually turned up an hour or so later just as we finished dinner. He tried to explain the conflict between guests staying in the hotel and party guests but he didn't seem to agree that it was not appropriate to hold loud parties that could be heard in guest rooms. However, he was concerned that they couldn't be certain when we would have hot water so he offered us a different room at the side of the building furthest away from the music. While annoying to have to pack everything up we agreed to move in the hope that things would improve.

To our surprise we got upgraded to a suite but most importantly we had hot water and couldn't hear the music...finally!

It did seem that we had really made a mark as everyone seemed to be tripping over themselves to be nice to us the next day - it became a bit overwhelming! They kept bringing us food to try at breakfast and offering us all sorts - seems like we weren't going to get
Sikri
the anonymity that we'd hoped for by checking into a big hotel!

That day we'd booked a trip out to Fatehpur Sikri, an abandoned city about 40km north of Agra, built by Akbar, one of the Mughal emperors. Our guide told us that he had been unusual in being open to all religions and marrying 3 wives, a Hindu, a Muslim and a Christian. He travelled to the area to see a Sufi sage who lived in a cave to get some advice because he had not managed to have a child with any of his wives. His Hindu wife gave him a son and he stayed and built the fort and mosque. Each wife had their own house, the Hindu's being by far the largest as she had given him the son. The guide we had wasn't the best and tried to hurry us around when we wanted time to take photos and wander a bit - we haven't had guides at many places we've been to, partly because it's hard to work out who to take as there's lots of people hustling and partly for the reason that they seem to rush you through a place.

From the fort we went to the mosque which is beautiful. It is often visited by couples who want children and they tie a thread around a window, make an offering of a brightly coloured piece of cloth and make a wish. Our guide took us to somebody who was selling these and tried to get us to buy one saying that they were collected up and passed onto local poor people. We were not happy that the guide had taken us to be hassled by somebody selling things and we told him - this got a very cold response and many of his answers to questions after that were monosyllabic.

He then rushed us around the mosque but we stood our ground and went where we wanted to take pictures before finally leaving to catch the bus and then our taxi back to Agra for a final night in luxury. I fitted in a complimentary massage as offered by the manager the night before....could definitely get used to this!

The following day we had been due to take a train in the evening to get back to Delhi but watching the previous few days trains it was clear that they had been badly affected by fog sometimes not arriving until the middle of the night so we had cancelled the train and booked a car. This was actually likely to take longer but would at least get there in daylight, though with nightmare Delhi traffic and a lost driver only just! Which takes us towards the end of our independent travelling in India and getting ready for Bhutan.....next time.

A few of the worlds population are lucky enough to see some of the great wonders here on earth. For instance, I had the pleasure of seeing the majestic Taj Mahal. Every time I get to experience another amazing place such as India, I cannot help but say there is nothing quite like it, which of course is true. However, there is something different with this wonder. Usually, when locals ask what I think about it, I usually say there are no words to describe it, but to Taj even from afar was incredible. So much words can be describe with this wonder. Everything that relates to beauty and elegance an be describe to the detailed marvelous architecture. I am glad I made this a priority to see this year.

Asia » India » Uttar Pradesh » Lucknow
December 17th 2015
Published: December 17th 2015


‘Lucknow’ is not a destination. It is a journey.



From being laid down by Lord Lakshmana to being ruled by Mughal emperors to being the administrative capital during the British Raj to finally being the capital of Uttar Pradesh … “Lucknow” has seen it all … & how!! … & through all of this Lucknow proudly has lived up to its reputation of being a city of culture, gracious living, rich cuisine & beauty.



Lucknow comes across as a fairly simple & easy city. Traces of each of the era the city has lived through are sure to be seen & felt quite easily & adequately. The city will happily hold your hand & show you around. It is quite miraculous.



Once in Lucknow, celebrations of “Bada Mangal” cannot be missed. It is a festival devoted to Lord Hanuman & is unique to the city. One can see orange colored “<em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Boondi ke laddoo” being distributed across all temples <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">(cannot be missed!).



Lucknow was the home of the Nawabs of Avadh (<em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Oudh) who were great patrons of the culinary and other arts, particularly dance and music, poetry, finer aspects of lifestyle. Hence, Lucknow is often lovingly referred to as the city of Nawaabs, Tehzeeb (<em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Respect), Kebab (<em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Food) & Shabaab (<em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Beauty).



Lucknow’s “Chikankaari” has been an integral part of the Indian culture since time immemorial & was highly patronized by the Mughals. This exquisite needle & hand work is admired world over & has trickled into every section of fashion world. The natural “<em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Itra”<em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;""> (perfume unique to Lucknow) carries the aroma of Lucknow’s rich culture & sophistication. It is a must buy!



The city is Sprinkled with several Mughal and British Raj-era buildings & mausoleums - Residency, Bara Imambara including the incredible Bhool Bhullaiya, Rumi Darwaza, Jama Masjid to name a few. Getting lost in Bhool Bhullaiya is a must when visiting Lucknow! It is a labyrinth of hundreds of narrow stairway passages, some of which also have dead ends, which was constructed to confuse intruders. It is one of the most mysterious places I have come across. One can also take a “<em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Tanga ride” to Chhota Imambara from here. The ‘<em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">tanga wallahs’ are very interactive & it is quite interesting to understand the difference between a <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">‘tanga’, ‘ikka’, ‘Bagghi’ & ‘Khadh-khadha’, all the incredible modes of transport used by the Nawaabs.



The Railway Station of Lucknow needs a special mention too … one of the prettiest stations ever!



You would often hear Lucknowites say “<em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Yahan par sab nawaab hain!” … The soul of the city cannot be summed up better. Every Lucknowite is a nawaab … & as a guest to the city one is sure to be treated as a Nawaab too!



It is difficult to not fall in love with Lucknow. And I love it most for its simplicity & for making me the “Nawaab” I am!!

Ayodhya has interested me ever since learning about the terrible events across India (mainly the communal violence that erupted in Mumbai and in Gujarat) following the 1992 storming and destroying by Hindu fundamentalist zealots of the Babri Masjid (a mosque built in 1528 under Emperor Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in India).

At the time of these eruptions my friend Kitty was just 12 and living with her parents in an inner suburb of Mumbai. She remembers gazing in awe and disbelief at what she was seeing across her city. She says she was “watching my country and city burn. That
Citadel of Ramkot
Main Temple is now within the walls
period in our history left me with no desire to visit any of these places in the north/east . It was a terrible time, and I still remember being up on the terrace of our Worli building, watching the fires rage throughout the city and mobs wandering the streets, looting shops. Not pleasant memories”.

Ayodhya, some 70 km north east of Lucknow and close to Faizabad, has always been just too far out of the way of my bike journeys for easy access. However this time, I decided I would make the effort... and not too much of a detour on my way from Haridwar to Varanasi. On the way I felt some anticipation about what I might find... would the place be full of hard core right wing Hindus? Will a foreigner even be welcome there?

Believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama, Ayodhya certainly deserves some attention for anyone interested in Hindu mythology and history. It is the prime setting of the epic Ramayana and so is a significant place of pilgrimage for Hindus. A temple had existed to mark the city as Rama's birthplace and while disputed as to being the actual place
Main Temple - Hunaman Garhi
Hunaman the monkey god who assisted Ram to liberate Sita from Lanka, is said to have lived here.
of birth (no-one knows where exactly in Ayodhya that was), that temple was demolished by Babar and replaced by the Babri Masjid. With the renaissance of Hindu fundamentalism in recent times, Ayodhya became the focus of a campaign to invigorate extreme Hindu political and religious sentiment, resulting in mobs from across the country descending there in 1992 and (encouraged by political puppeteers) demolishing the historic old mosque.

The extreme right wing of Hinduism (the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or RSS founded in 1925) was strongly involved. It claims to be a social organisation to provide character training through Hindu discipline and to unite the Hindu community. RSS volunteers participate in political and social movements and initially drew inspiration from European right-wing groups (including the Nazis). It has grown into an extremely prominent Hindu nationalist umbrella organisation whose members participate in anti-Muslim violence. Ayodhya has a small Muslim population, and its isolation made it an easy focus for RSS attention.

In the aftermath of the mosque being destroyed, retaliations and counter retaliations across the country resulted in thousands of deaths (the actual figure is not clear), rapes, lootings, and displacement of communities. The role of known political leaders is not
Main Temple courtyard
clear but accusations were made and the then Chief Minister of Gujarat (Modi, now the Prime Minister of India) faced a legal process accused of complicity in initiating and not doing enough to stop the violence against Muslims in his state. After he was cleared, the Muslim community was reported to have reacted with anger and disbelief, with the chief cleric of Delhi's Jama Masjid saying ""Modi is a terrorist. He unleashed state-sponsored terrorism in Gujarat"". At worst, the riots (and in Gujarat in particular) could be seen as a form of ethnic cleansing.

What I found in Ayodhya was a peaceful old charm small city that decried the tumultuous events of 1992, with people leading simple lives oriented around the worship of Lord Rama in a beautiful central temple where it was clear many pilgrims came from afar to visit and receive blessings. While spending only a couple of days there, I was certain I was the only foreigner in town. I was made to feel very welcome in my street interactions with locals which tested my modest knowledge of Hindi. The site of the Babri Masjid now had a simple covered open walled shrine. There I found
King of Ayodhya Palace
No longer a kingdom, but descendants still do live here
a tranquil scene: a group of Muslims under a tree receiving instruction and blessings from their mullah; a woman shaping cow dung patties in a corner of the complex, and behind her a Hindu temple. People in the neighbouring streets were quietly and peacefully going about their business. I was hardly noticed as I wandered around.

Some weeks after I visited Chittrakoot on the Mandakini river, about 130 km south of Allahabad (or Illahabad if you were to follow the Devanagari phonetic). Ram spent 11 years living there during his exile from Ayodhya (it's a long story and best read about in the Ramayana). While there I visited a fantastic display of the Ramayana called Ram Darshan. I just was awe-struck by this guy Ram (be he a truly historic figure or not) as such an inspiring example for all mankind. In my view he was a saint to be emulated for sure. He was inclusive (including transcending caste distinction and assisting sexually abused women to reenter civil society), compassionate, forgiving, but still able to act decisively to eliminate sure evil. One time he slew a corrupt local leader who was exploiting the common people. So I stood there
Street scence central Ayodhya
wondering... how can some Indians (particularly I allude to present day politicians) piously go and worship this guy and continue in their corrupt and exploitative and greedy ways?

But moreover... how can the fundamentalist wing of Hinduism, in the name of Ram, carry out the events in Ayodhya at he expense of simple Muslem citizens and then stand by and watch the bloody aftermath that ensued? Such hypocrisy. Well, nothing too different than is done in all religions (can you fathom the Sri Lankan civil war atrocities carried out by the so-called Buddhist aligned government; same thing in Myanmar against Muslim minorities; Serbian ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Kosovo; Spanish and Portuguese genocide in the name of Christianity in South America; to mention just a few examples).

I met Sundeep while in Ayodhya, a 35 year old who was managing the Government Guest House where I stayed (it being one of two only options for foreigners). He was an amazing guy with a story I would love to help him write. At the age of just 11 months he was found on the roadside near Mumbai besides the burning Ambassador car, an accident that killed both his parents.
Muslim shrine on Babri Masjid site
He was adopted but when his step-mother eventually managed to have her own child, returned to the orphanage at age 8. He ran away and then started his amazing life of establishing a future that he controlled to an extent.... at least to be self-directed in what he did. His childhood and schooling was subsumed out of necessity (as happens for many) working in a dhabar washing dishes, and later became a driver (in India most middle class people in cities who own cars employ a driver who is then to be available at any time day and night... on a kind or retainer income). He then started his self-funded education and gained qualifications and better paying jobs managing businesses. He now moves around India. He claims to speak no less than 9 languages. Sundeep was a devotee of Shiva. I have no doubt that Sundeep appreciated the finer attributes of Ram. I was encouraged by this fine young man with a sure future in modern India (if corruption and greed fought against by Ram can be tamed).

So, Ayodhya and it's recent history: what would Ram think?

chauffeur_tuk_tuk
Nous retrouvons les tuk-tuk déjà rencontrés en Tanzanie sous un nouveau nom : auto-rickshaw, ou « auto » pour les intimes. Constat intéressant : on rencontre une grande diversité de triporteurs, à moteur ou non, auxquels s’ajoutent d’autres modes de transport. Les voies sont assez grandes (jusqu’à 4 ou 5 voitures par sens de circulation), et beaucoup de véhicules fonctionnent au gaz.

Comme dans les autres pays visités jusqu’ici, la circulation se fait à gauche, dans le sens contraire de celui utilisé en France ou au Cameroun. Il arrive néanmoins de croiser des tuk-tuk ou des voitures venant à contre-sens.

Nous profitons de cette étape indienne pour recharger nos batteries après 35 jours de voyage, en optant pour un rythme touristique très allégé : nous n’avons prévu de visiter que 2 villes du Nord de l’Inde, Agra (où se trouve le fameux Taj Mahal) et Delhi. Ce sera aussi l’occasion d’aller à la rencontre de la communauté camerounaise locale.

Dès le samedi suivant notre arrivée, nous planifions une journée touristique dense à travers Delhi : Akshardham, Indian Gate, Lotus Temple, Qutub Minar, Red Fort de Delhi. Mais c’était sans compter les imprévus : le chauffeur de taxi arrive
Indian_Gate_1
avec près de 2h de retard et ne connaît pas les routes, ce qui fait qu’on ne visite que les 2 premiers sites et on arrive au 3e lorsqu’il est fermé. Nous décidons de programmer une autre visite à Delhi plus tard.

Le dimanche, Lionel et moi nous rendons à l’église catholique Saint Joseph pour la messe de 8h30 en anglais.

Au cours des jours suivants, Julien et moi avons l’occasion de visiter un peu Greater Noida, de passer du temps en famille, de découvrir la culture et la cuisine indiennes, ainsi que d’apprendre quelques mots d’hindi : namaste = bonjour, tchok = rond-point, shoukri = dendeval = merci, tchali = 40 roupies, patcha = 50 roupies, sida = tout droit.

Jeudi matin nous quittons Greater Noida vers 6h30 pour Agra, accompagnés de 2 camerounaises de notre entourage. Au programme du jour : la visite du Taj Mahal et du Red Fort d’Agra, ou « Agra Fort ». Le prix d’entrée est plus élevé pour les touristes que pour les locaux, mais il est possible de bénéficier d’une réduction en achetant les billets des 2 sites en même temps, soit 1000 Rs.

Dès l’arrivée sur le
Indian_Gate_2
site du Taj Mahal, diverses personnes proposent leurs services : guides, photographes, chameliers et conducteurs de véhicules électriques. Un guide s’impose à nous et se propose de servir d’intermédiaire entre nous et les autres prestataires. Nous insistons pour connaître son tarif ; mais il élude nos questions en nous disant qu’on en discutera à la fin en fonction de notre satisfaction, avec pour seule réponse « you will give me what you want ». Il nous propose aussi les services d’un photographe avec lequel il travaille régulièrement, et nous optons pour effectuer le kilomètre qui sépare le parking de l’entrée du site à bord d’une charrette tirée par un chameau.

Le site du Taj Mahal est grandiose, et le mausolée lui-même force le respect. On oublierait presque qu’il s’agit d’un lieu abritant les sépultures d’un couple. Il a fallu de nombreuses années pour construire le site, et grâce au guide nous prêtons attention à la symétrie des jardins et à la finesse des constructions.

A la fin de la visite qui dure 2h, le guide nous indique que son travail est terminé et nous le remercions de son éclairage. Nous lui proposons alors un pourboire (100 Rs) qu’il
Indian_Gate_3
juge insuffisant par rapport à son tarif (2000 Rs). Nous lui rappelons que nous avons réclamé cette information à plusieurs reprises ; lui se montre offensé et s’énerve au point de nous dire de partir sans payer. Nous gardons notre calme et le prenons au mot… Nous attendons tout de même le photographe pour récupérer les photos prises au début de la visite, puis quittons le Taj Mahal pour l’Agra Fort. Cette fois ce sera sans guide, pour éviter tout malentendu. :-)

Nous terminons cette journée culturelle bien remplie en rentrant sous les coups de 17h. Le chauffeur de taxi était ponctuel et connaissait bien les itinéraires ; il nous a même fait découvrir un restaurant indien végétarien sur le chemin du retour.

Le dimanche suivant est le 1er dimanche du mois, et à cette occasion l’église St Joseph propose un office animé par la chorale africaine à 11h. On y retrouve des membres de différentes communautés anglophones et francophones.

Dans l’après-midi, Julien et moi sommes invités à la réunion de l’association des étudiants africains de l’Uttar Pradesh dont fait partie mon frère. Nous sommes sensibilisés aux difficultés rencontrés par ces jeunes, et aux projets qu’ils mènent
Restaurant_Greater_Noida_1
DSC_0315
pour se soutenir les uns les autres et faire rayonner l’image du Cameroun à l’étranger. Cela nous donne aussi l’opportunité d’échanger et de partager nos expériences professionnelles et personnelles. La soirée se termine par un apéro et un repas partagé auquel nous sommes invités, cette fois au sens propre.

Lundi, nous planifions notre 2e excursion à Delhi pour le lendemain, et réservons nos 2 premières nuits pour le séjour à venir à Bangkok.

Mardi, nous avons rendez-vous vers 7h30 avec le chauffeur de taxi qui nous a emmenés à Agra. Il arrive finalement vers 8h30, avec un remplaçant car il a un empêchement. Nous nous retrouvons dans la même situation que lors de notre première excursion à Delhi : le chauffeur ne connaît pas les routes, malgré ce qu’il a affirmé au départ. De plus il parle peu anglais, et nous sommes loin d’être bilingues en hindi... Pour ne rien arranger, nous passons beaucoup de temps dans les embouteillages. A la fin de la journée nous avons visité Qutub Minar (très beau site pour découvrir les influences musulmanes en Inde), le « Garden of Five senses » (qui ne vaut définitivement pas le détour), et le mémorial de
Restaurant_Greater_Noida_2
DSC_0317
Gandhi qui est très sympa. Nous avons de nouveau renoncé au Lotus Temple, cette fois à cause de la longue file d’attente qui promettait 2h de queue.

Mercredi, dernier jour en Inde avant la Thaïlande ; le vol Air India Delhi – Bangkok est prévu à 13h45.

On prévoit de partir de la maison à 10h, mais finalement ce sera à 10h40. Nous espérons arriver à temps pour l’enregistrement qui se termine à 13h. Avec les embouteillages il nous faut 2h pour rejoindre l’aéroport ; il est 12h40 quand on commence la queue pour l’enregistrement.

10 minutes plus tard (12h50) la queue n’avance pas, on interpelle une hôtesse pour nous faire couper la file.

- Nous : il est presque l’heure pour notre vol, c’est ok ?

- Elle : vos tickets svp – on les lui donne et elle va à un guichet

12h50 et 15 secondes…

- Elle : l’enregistrement est fermé

- Nous : quoi ?

- Elle, placide : le vol est fermé

- Nous : Quoi ? Heu ?... Il reste 10 minutes

normalement, c’est marqué sur le site internet

- Elle, nous guidant vers un stand à l’autre bout de l’aéroport : non c’est 1h avant le vol, merci d’aller au guichet de la compagnie si vous avez des réclamations.

On y va, et apparemment on n’est pas les seuls à s’être faits « avoir par l’heure » vu la longue file de personnes qui ont raté l’enregistrement.

3h et quelques larmes plus tard, la mort dans l’âme et surtout le portefeuille troué, on a racheté des billets pour le vol de Bangkok du lendemain.

Note pour Lionel : plus d’1h pour imprimer un billet d’avion… Jamais ils ne nous dépasseront. :-)

Nous rentrons sur Greater Noida pour passer cette dernière soirée en famille, et modifions notre réservation à Bangkok.

Nous avons retenu la leçon : l’enregistrement ferme 1h avant le vol, et au vu de la foule il faut réellement être présent à l’aéroport 3h à l’avance pour éviter de louper son vol.

Jeudi, nous quittons la maison à 8h25 et arrivons à l’aéroport à 9h40 ; malgré un temps d’attente à l’enregistrement court (30’), il nous faut ensuite près
Charrette_chameau
DSC_0321
d’1h30 pour passer les différentes formalités administratives. Notamment parce qu’on n’est pas à l’abri d’une ultime complication au niveau du bureau d’immigration ou de la sécurité. Nous profitons de l’heure qui nous reste avant l’embarquement pour manger et changer nos dernières roupies indiennes en dollars, puis laissons derrière nous l’Inde.

untitled-37-2
Full moon, Nov 25th.
These blogs are going to be out of order, but while I was traveling in India the internet was so unreliable, I couldn't do much blogging.

After my travel writing/photography group returned to Delhi at the end of the workshop, I went with two companions, to Varanasi to partake of the Dev Deepawali Candle Light festival. This is held on the full moon night of November with much preparation and celebration the two days before the full moon. Hindu legend holds that on this night, this year the 25th of November, the gods are believed to descend to Earth to bathe in the Ganges, Ma Ganga, the mother goddess. The steps of all the ghats (the banks of the river) on the riverfront of the Ganges River, from Ravidas Ghat at the southern end to Rajghat, are lit with more than a million earthen lamps diyas in honor of Ma Ganga. All along the river are ceremonies and prayers being led by Hindu priests. There are countless people on the ghats strolling from one end of the riverfront to the other, and nearly as many in boats on the river. Pilgrims from all over India and the world come to
untitled-37-8
Dev deepawali festival.
witness the spectacle and partake of the prayers and blessings. With the million of little oil lamps, cremation fires going 24/7 at most of the ghats, and the colorful Indian clothing it was a feast for the eyes and camera.

My friends and I were lucky enough to book ""guest house"" rooms on the internet from Dehli, right on the river with a balcony overlooking the river. It was simple digs for a low price and although meals were extra the food was great and downright cheap. Plus our room came with boat ride reservations the night of the 24th, the morning of the 25th and the night of 25th. I hope the photos below give you a taste of our experience.

Meditating on the Taj ;-)
Yes - experiencing the Taj Mahal was definitely on our bucket list since many years. Going to Agra was not on that list. But one does not go without the other. As we were already in Vrindavan, it was just a 1 hour drive to Agra. So this time, we took the chance and went to visit the well known symbol of India. But we made our homework well, thankfully.

On Travelblog as well as from other travellers we have heard and read horrible stories about accomodation and about scams in Agra. So we spent quite some time looking or a nice guesthouse. And we found a perfect one. It was not a cheapy, more a midrange option. But the price was perfect for what it offered. It was Mohini Homestay. We had a big clean room, a super clean bathroom, no stains on the bedsheets and the towels. It was warm (quite important as the nights can be chilly at this time of the year) and we got a great breakfast and lovely pure veg dinner. Sanjay, gave us some important tips around the city. We did not book anything, no private taxi or rickshaw driver (which is very
gate of Baby Taj facing the Yamuna River
common here for tourists, as there are too many scams when you want to get a rickshaw on the road). But we knew the prizes thanks to Sanjay....

First morning, with both of us having a strong cold, we slept long. After breakfast we walked to Taj Ganj, the old, busy area around the Taj. Finally we settled on a rooftop of a place, recommanded by the Lonely Planet: Saniya Palace Hotel. How happy we were that we did not have to stay here. After looking at the filthy rooms, the shared bathroom (with squat toilets) and the horribly dirty kitchen (and hey, we are used to a lot of things - but this was awful, with cockroaches and rats running around) we were only going up to the rooftop, had a safe, bottled soda in the cafe just to enjoy our first view of the Taj. And it was lovely. It was sunny, a bit foggy and mysticaly the Taj Mahal, the symbol of love, was right in front of our eyes. Wow! What a beautiful building. But as it was sunday and midday, it was already very crowded.

Therefore, the Taj had to wait another day
view from Baby Taj over the holy Yamuna River
for our visit. We went down, argued with some rickshaw drivers and finally were on our way to the Agra Fort. If you think, Agra only is the Taj Mahal - wrong! There are so many more stunning things to see. One of them, without any doubt, is the Agra Fort. How big it is! And the architecture and the whole grandeur of this place simply made us speechless. We took a lot of time to wander around and enjoy the silence in the gardens. After, again we had some arguments with the rickshaw drivers, but we found one who took us over the bridge of the Yamuna River on the other side of the city to the Baby Taj. This is also a mausoleum, much smaller in size than the touch, with only few people - but also very beautiful. And it was so peaceful. We enjoyed a small selfmade picnic in the gardens before we made our way to the Metha Bagh - the sunset viewpoint of the Taj Mahal across the river.

The Metha Bagh is a nice botanical garden where one can wander around. It reaches the holy Yamuna River. From here you have a
stunning and huge Agra Fort
wonderful views of the Taj. Unfortunately, it was too foggy and the sun had already disappeared. So we did not have a sunset view. But a very nice view anyway.

The next morning we woke up at 5.30 am and made our way to the entrance gate of the Taj. It was still dark and a bit hard to find the way on our own. But we finally made it. There are some security checks and, as in all sights of Agra, the tourists have to pay about 10 times more than the locals. So it is not a cheap thing to do. But we entered the gardens and here we were: through the fog we could spot the Taj Mahal! A majestic view and, with the fog a mystical view. We took it slowly. There were only few people around at this time of the day. So we could freely walk around without following the crowds. It was wonderful. But it was cold and we were very happy when finally the sun tried to fight the fog. What an amazing light. The Taj Mahal is really beautiful. There are no words to describe the beauty and the detailed
Taj Mahal seen from Mehtab Bagh
the so called sunset viewpoint - if there is sun ;-)
work. One must experience it. And even though it is one of the main tourist sites in the world - if you come to the right time it is worth every penny! We were so happy that we finally made our way to the Taj. Our pictures will not do justice to what we really saw. Neither do our words.

Still, there ar emore things to see in and around Agra. Unfortunately, we did not have more time. Because of some work issues, Markus had to take a flight back to Switzerland (but will be coming back to India after 2 weeks). And Nina decided to head south into the warmer parts of India for a relaxed time on the beach.

So, do not let the horrible stories of Agra keep you away from visiting it. Do you homework and you will have a fabulous stay here! Go and touch the Taj!

Saddhu in Vrindavan
I, Nina, have been to Vrindavan already in March for Holi. And in November, Markus followed. We both went on pilgrimages around Vrindavan with our spiritual master, Mahamandaleshwar Sri Swami Vishwananda. For both of us, the pilgrimages have been very special. An experience we hopefully will repeat one day. An experience we cannot put in words. Such a pilgrimage is not about travelling in the outside although one visits holy places. It is more a travel within, a travel towards your soul. A way from the mind towards the heart. We both have not taken any pictures of the pilgrimages. And as it was a very personal experience, we will not write a blog about it. But those of you guys who are interested can contact us via a personal message.



Nevertheless, we want to share some impressions of Vrindavan. Vrindavan is the city where Krishna spend his childhood. It is the city which is full of love - and one can feel this vibe. From the outside, it is a dirty city. There is dust everywhere. Buildings are rundown, around every corner there is rubbish, dirt. The beauty of Vrindavan lies beyond what we see. It is
Bankhe Bihari Temple
in the heart of the people who come here. Visiting the temples is simply amazing. There is singing, dancing and, over all, a really strong energy. Hard to describe - how can one describe feelings? People in the street greet each other with ""Radhe Radhe"". Vrindavan is the city of Bhakti. Bhakti is Sanskrit and means ""devotion"". It is the devotion to God, the devotion to Krishna which is in every corner of the city.



I, Nina, arrived at the end of Markus' pilgrimage. The reason for this was, that Sri Swami Vishwananda was giving a public darshan in Vrindavan 2 days after my arrival. So I took a flight from Switzerland to Dehli and directly went to Vrindavan. I could not have wished a better start for my 6 weeks in India than going to a Darshan of my Guruji. After my arrival in Vrindavan, I made a visit to the Iskcon Temple, This is the temple of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness. But after the night flight, I was way too tired and called it an early night. Th next day I was blessed to join the morning abishekam (a ceremony in Hinduism with
Yamuna River
prayers and mantras) with the pilgrimage group and guruji. It was amazing. Later on I could join the group for a visit of the wedding place of Radha and Krishna. It was a full moon night and it was a really great atmosphere - with the full moon shining over the fields around Vrindavan.



The next day was the day of the darshan. It was simply amazing!!! We are so blessed and so lucky to again and again receive such a huge blessing from a living saint. The following day the pilgrimage of Markus ended. We took the time to visit the construction site of the ashram of Bhakti Marga (Bhakti Marga is the organisation of Sri Swami Vishwananda based in Germany). This new ashram will be opened next year in Vrindavan. Later on we walked some parts of the parikrama (the pilgrimage route around Vrindavan), visited some temples and went shopping.



We both were very sad to leave Vrindavan the next day. Our minds will never understand it, but we lost our hearts in Vrindavan.

The Ganges River at sunrise in Varanasi (13)
26-28 November -Varanasi









In the early afternoon we caught the flight from khajuraho to Varanasi. It was a long procedure checking in and going through security….but we are in India.







After a quick hour, we arrived at Varanasi airport then transfered to the Ramada for our first night. Our new driver and host from Incredible Real India picked us up and immediately on exiting the airport grounds, we saw how different this city was compared to all others we have visited to date.







Our 2 days here showed us how colourful, unrelentingly chaotic, indiscreet, unfinished, and the good and not so good in relation to Indians associated with the tourist industry, but generosity outside the industry. Let me explain.







After checking in we were driven 3 kms to the shore of the Ganges…this took 40 minutes!!! We were met by a guide whom our driver handed us over to. We then organized a rowboat and rower. We learned the next morning that this was the first time we have been ripped
1 Varanas at night - took 40 mins to travel 3 kms
off in India. We paid over triple the fee which we paid for our sunrise boat trip - too bad!







We did however see the amazing sights at and after sunset that we have read about for many years: cremations (over 100 occur per day, 24/7), Brahma ceremonies and chants (very colourful and many lights), 1000s of locals, many of whom were pilgrims, and tourists.







Pilgrims come to the western banks of River Ganges to wash away their lifetime of sins in the sacred waters or to cremate their loved ones. It's a particularly auspicious place to die, since expiring here offers 'liberation from the cycle of life and death' our guide told us, making Varanasi the beating heart of the Hindu universe.







We saw many old men settling down for the night on the steps. These were poor men waiting to die so that they were on the spot to be cremated. Many of them had painted face and our guide said they lived on smoking grass and food handouts. Very heart wrenching.




1 Varanasi at 5.30am - streets are empty. Took 12 mins to travel 3 kms



We found this place not to be for the faint hearted. Large piles of wood could be seen as we rowed up to the edge of the river. Five bodies were burning. Only men come to the cremations with closest relative dressed in white robes.







Now wait for this: dogs were there and they would find the human bones that were not fully burnt. We couldn't believe what we were hearing. The group of men, who were known as the untouchables, were flippantly labeled as the 2nd wealthiest people in Varanasi. After the cremation (3 hours) and as they collect the ashes to give to the relatives, they also collect all the gold that the deceased person was wearing, and keep it.!!!! And Indian people wear a lot of gold.







The scenes were incredible so hope the photos give you some idea of what we saw.







We then rowed along to watch the ceremonies that the men in yellow were performing, waving fire and lights to the beating of drums and other instruments. It was a spectacle.
Over 100 Cremations per day on The Ganges in Varanas (1)
After 2 hours, we rowed back to shore and was driven back to our hotel.







The next morning we were picked up at 5.30am to catch the sunrise at the same spot as the previous night. The western bank was very different at sunrise. Jumpers and jeans were the order of the morning. We repeated our rowing path in addition to seeing the site where the electrical and quicker cremations occurred.







We saw 100s of people washing themselves in the river. We also saw people washing their clothes and sheets. Some were doing yoga which is very popular in India. Many people in the boats had flowers and candles which they floated in the Ganges to give them good Kama etc. There is a massive amount of rituals that are practiced repeatedly throughout the day, particularly by Hindus, so that their gods treat/serve them well through their life. We saw many people kissing their hand and touching the sacred cattle in the street.







After, we walked through the Old City situated along the western bank ghats, we wlkked through
Dogs chew human bones that are not burned with the cremation on Ganges in Varanas
a labyrinth of alleys called galis that are too narrow for traffic. They can be a bit disorientating so we were very pleased to be with our guide. This was the first time the smells were strong and with the sacred cattle wandering through the alleys, you had to watch were you stepped.







He took us to the 1776 Kashi Vishwanath temple (Vishveswara was Shiva the lord of the universe), but as were not Hindu and were not prepared to sign various papers, we didn't go in. There is 800kg of gold plating on the tower and dome so it is often referred to as the golden temple. The area was full of soldiers because of security issues and communal tensions. Bags, cameras, mobile phones, pens and any other electrical devise can't be taken into the alley where this temple is.







Varanasi is a very holy city so there are 100s of temples - Hindu, Moslem and Buddhist.







The guide took us to his place and his father showed us a lot of bedspreads, table cloths etc. etc. He
Brahma monk Varanasi
said they were made on site and showed us a weaving machine which definitely had not been used since it was moved to his place!!!! That's India (sometimes)!







Just as a note, the current Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, is a Varanasi Member of Parliament so it has been getting some extra attention with new projects, road works and a general (much needed) sprucing up. There is massive poverty in this 3rd world city.







We then went back to the hotel to have breakfast, pack up and then move to our next hotel the Meradan Grand Hotel. Because we had a change in program and because it was a special festival going on, bookings were heavy.







During the afternoon our driver picked us up and took us to the nearby Buddhist stupas, Sarnath temple (the place where first prayer of Lord Buddha took place). There were several temples in the area including an archeological dig site with multiple temples.







That night we had dinner in the rooftop restaurant of our hotel. The service
Varanas (2)
was fantastic and the food was tasty. Our waiter was excellent.







Other than seeing the Taj, the highlight of our trip so far was this particular night when we were literally dragged into a wedding reception at our hotel by the bride's father.







After we had dinner, we heard a band down below on the footpath and then saw fireworks. We knew it was a wedding. After looking over the side of the restaurant wall, we decided to go down and have a closer look. There was a small ceremony being done between the groom and the father and father-in-law (to be), sitting on mats out front of the hotel.







I went closer to the party to take photos and was encouraged to do so. The party then got up and went inside the hotel. As they did, the bride's father spotted me and grabbed my arm and said ""please come and have dinner with us'. In the Australian and Cummings way, I told him I did not want to intrude"". All he did was continue to firmly guide
The Ganges River at sunrise in Varanasi - bathing in the sacred waters (12)
me along with the rest of the party.







We entered the reception room where there were 100s of people and the father sat us in the front row of seats…asking one person to move…very embarrassing!







Before being seated, we watchone of the Indian wedding traditions. The bridesmaids blocked the reception room doorway. The groom had to buy his way into the room by placing money on the silver tray which one of the girls was carrying. There was a lot of loud chatting by the group, none of which we understood. Anyway, the groom entered the room and sat on a lavish lounge which was on a stage.







The photos began in earnest. He had his photo taken with the many different groups in the room.







Then we heard the bride was about to enter. The 4 bridesmaids each held a corner of this glittering transparent piece of material which the bride was walking under. They walked towards the groom who joined her under the 'cover'. They both walked up on
The Ganges River at sunrise in Varanasi - bathing in the sacred waters (10)
the stage. Many, many more photos were taken.







There was then an exchange of flower leis between the bride and groom. We were not witnessing the actual legal part of the marriage. This was to take place the next day.







Then the father of the bride told us to stand up and he introduced us to all the guests. We couldn't believe it. He then told us to stand behind the bride and groom to have our photo taken with them. Many other groups did also.







I hope you can pick up from the photos, the heavily-jewelled clothes of the bride and groom. They looked incredible. I am not sure how long it would have taken the bride to dress.







The father then insisted we have dinner. We started to say that we had already had dinner but a younger man with better English come over and explained that we must accept the father's invitation, even if we only eat a small amount.







The whole
Tom & Doorman
evening was amazing. We said our farewells as we learned that the party would go well into the wee hours of the morning. This was day 2 of the 4-day wedding celebration.







The father's generosity was incredible. We learned that this was the Indian way. They love sharing the wedding celebrations of their children. He was very proud of his beautiful daughter.







28 November 2015







After breakfast we visited the Bharat Mata Temple, Durga Temple, and Mosque of Moghul Emperor Aurangazeb.







At about 3.00pm, we checked out of our hotel and our driver took us to the airport. Our flight was going to be 1hr 40 minutes late…nothing unusual in India.

Partis de Zanzibar le mercredi soir, nous avons fait escale à Doha (Qatar) et sommes arrivés à l’aéroport international Indira Gandhi ce jeudi matin à 7h30. Ayant des visas électroniques (e-tourist visa), nous nous dirigeons vers les files correspondantes, impatients de rejoindre mon frangin Lionel venu nous chercher et chez qui nous passerons le séjour. Tout se passe bien jusqu’à l’arrivée au contrôle d’immigration, où chacun de nous se dirige vers un guichet distinct.

Au bout de 5 minutes j’ai terminé, mais Julien est retenu par l’agent avec qui il s’entretient. On m’invite à m’avancer vers la sortie, ce que je fais sans trop d’entrain.

En chemin je croise mon frère, que je suis surprise de trouver de ce côté. Il m’indique qu’effectivement les personnes qui accueillent les voyageurs restent généralement à l’extérieur, mais que n’ayant rencontré aucun obstacle il est venu à notre rencontre. Nous discutons du voyage en attendant Julien, qui ne nous rejoint toujours pas. Je finis par rebrousser chemin, expliquant aux agents qui me font signe de faire demi-tour que j’attends mon mari bloqué dans les formalités. Julien, toujours au même guichet, me signale par des gestes que la situation est mitigée. Ne lui étant d’aucune utilité, je retourne rejoindre Lionel.

Après un certain temps Julien finit par nous rejoindre, et nous explique qu’il y avait une erreur sur son e-visa. Le numéro de passeport mentionné étant erroné, l’agent d’immigration l’a invité à rentrer chez lui... et ce n’est qu’après de longues explications que sa bonne foi a été prise en compte et qu’il a pu être autorisé à passer le poste de contrôle. Ouf de soulagement !

Alors que nous nous croyons tirés d’affaire, un homme s’intéresse à ce moment à notre trio et plus particulièrement à mon frère. Il lui demande de justifier sa présence auprès de voyageurs après le « duty free », lui indique qu’il n’a pas l’autorisation d’accéder à l’espace où nous nous trouvons, et le conduit vers des policiers et des gardes.

Au bout de 2 heures, pendant lesquelles nous récupérons nos bagages et nous inquiétons, Lionel nous rejoint accompagné de quelques gardes. Ils nous expliquent que le vigile qui a laissé passer Lionel va être sanctionné. Lionel s’en tire à bon compte, et ils prennent des copies de nos passeports pour leur rapport. Vers 10h30 nous pouvons enfin quitter l’aéroport et nous diriger vers Greater Noida, à environ 1h de route de Delhi.

Après nous être délestés de nos affaires et reposés, nous terminons cette première journée en allant prendre l’apéro chez une amie de Lionel, où nous faisons la connaissance d’étudiants africains.

Nous y sommes invités à partager bières, gâteau et jus tout au long de la soirée ; au moment de partir, l’addition s’annonce plus élevée que prévu car la note comprend les consommations de tous ceux qui étaient présents. Nous sommes pris de court par cette « invitation à la camerounaise » (ou à l’africaine ?), mais réglons la facture ; par contre nous décidons de clarifier les situations en amont pour éviter les malentendus lors des prochaines invitations.

Taj Mahal (9)
AGRA - 23 November 2015



After our breakfast we departed for Agra (1.7 mill people) - we had 240kms to travel - en route we visited Fatehpur Sikri.



The main sight at Fatehpur Sikri is the stunning imperial complex of pavilions and palaces spread among a large abandoned 'city' peppered with Mughal masterpieces: courtyards, intricate carvings, servants' quarters, vast gateways and ornamental pools.



A large courtyard dominates the NW entrance was the Hall of Public Audiences which is now a pristinely manicured garden here and was built to utilize an echo sound system, so Emperor Akbar could hear anything at anytime from anywhere throughout the open space.



We also saw the Buland Darwaza or Victory Gate, one of the world's most magnificent gateways. This is a 15-story sandstone gate, 54m high, a menacing monolith to Akbar's reign.



We were then off to see central Agra and the great Taj Hahal.







In 1501 Sultan Lodi established his capital in Agra, but the city fell into Mughal hands in 1526. Agra reached the peak of its magnificence between the mid-16th and
Taj Mahal (18)
Main Gate of Taj
mid-17th centuries when the Taj Mahal was built. Poet Tagore described the Taj Mahal as 'a teardrop on the cheek of eternity', Rudyard Kipling as 'the embodiment of all things pure' while its creator, Emperor Shan Jahan said it made 'the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes'.



Every year, tourists numbering more than twice the population of Agra pass through its gates to catch a once-in-a-lifetime glimpse of what is widely considered the most beautiful building in the world ……and we were there, gazing at that beauty - I will never take our luck for granted.



The Taj was built by Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th child in 1631. The building was not completed until 1653. In total some 20,000 people from India and central Asia worked on the building. Specialists were brought in from as far away as Europe.



We stayed at the Taj watching the sunset. Very special.



We thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience of the complex - building material of semitranslucent white marble, carved with flowers and inlaid with
Taj Mahal - the gate into the main area (3)
thousands of semi-precious stones in beautiful patterns, museums, gardens - absolutely stunning.



The guide we had was excellent. We had joined a group of 5 English people form Brighton. We exchanged contact details as one couple is coming to Aust next year - they are farmers!



We also enjoyed the view alongside of the Yamuna River (which used to be crocodile infested).



We then found Ravi waiting for us after we caught an electric bus for the 1km ride back to the car park.



We checked in at the Four Point Sheraton which opened only 2 months ago.

Later that evening, Ravi took us to the Indiana Restaurant which offered some MORE wonderful Indian food. Tom found it a little hot that night.

What an incredible day. It was one of those days we won't forget.

Temple Vibes
When we woke up in Varanasi, we arranged a tour with one of the men who worked at the hotel as his cousin owned a boat. This was ideal as we had been warned of the touts in Varanasi who have the reputation as the worst in India. We set off from the hotel expecting to jump in a tuk-tuk however we ended up walking along the road which was crowded with cars, bikes, scooters, tuk-tuks and cows, even being led into the middle of a busy roundabout! Then we reached the narrow and winding roads near the Ghats.

The Ghats in Varanasi are steps that lead to the River Ganges. There are 87 in total, and they are used as places for religious gatherings, bathing and cremation. The Ganges are seen to be the spiritual heart of Hinduism. Varanasi is one of India's oldest and most spiritual cities due to it being on the Ganges.

We got a huge boat to ourselves, driven by a 12 year old boy and his grandfather. Our guide was 19 year old Adil. Adil was studying English, history and economics at college because his dream is to be an official guide for
Daein the washin
the government. He was very enthusiastic to practise English with us and his knowledge of Varanasi and the Ghats was fantastic.

Adil offered to accompany us around the cobbled streets by foot to show us as much of Varanasi as he could in the day that we had. Whilst dodging cows blocking the small roads, he took us to temples and explained about the Hindu gods. He showed us special viewpoints at the top of buildings and he took us to the famous Blue Lassi Shop (lassi's are yoghurt drinks mixed with a fruit of your choice). For lunch, he took us to his favourite restaurant and made us try his favourite dish chilli paneer (goats cheese). It was lovely.

Throughout the day we would have to stop and move aside as men carried bodies beautifully covered in orange silk and flowers, down towards the burning ghat where cremations are held. You could hear the loud chanting before the body was carried past, along with drums. As our time was running out we asked if it was possible to get a closer look at the famous burning Ghat. Adil explained that it was no problem to visit the
Daein the washin better
burning ghat, and that people appreciate tourists interest in their religion and customs. We must admit it was pretty nerve wracking before we arrived. Adil informed us that family members are not supposed to cry at cremations, as this will interfere with the pathway to heaven.

It feels surprisingly normal when you watch the ceremony which lasts 3 hours (however we only stayed for 15 minutes). There is no smell when the bodies are burning.. according to Adil this is because of the Hindu god Shiva. When the body has turned to ash, the ashes are scattered in the Ganges. There are approximately 150 cremations each day.

If we could have planned our trip again we would have spent more time here as the spiritual nature of city is infectious.

That evening we went to get on our train to Jaipur to face another stressful railway station experience. Unfortunately the tickets we had bought were on the waiting list, and therefore our seats were not confirmed. This translates to 'yes you have paid for your ticket, but you're not getting on the train'. There was no other option but to get another train that night to Delhi,
Burning ghats
and make our way to Jaipur from there. In the end this added 10 hours to our travel time. We are now used to India interfering with our itinerary.

September 23rd 2015

Staying strong
On Tuesday morning we arrived in Allahabad and got off the sleeper train at about 4am. Due to Marc's sickness we were unable to explore the city. With no WiFi and all shops and cafés closed, we had no way of finding a hotel or hostel to book a room. So we had to turn up on the doorsteps of hotels and ask if we could stay. After being rejected from EIGHT hotels because we were foreign and therefore do not hold an Indian identity card, we were eventually accepted into a grubby looking hotel, but at least the room had air-con. That evening, once Marc was feeling better, we went to the railway station to get a train to Varanasi.

Our fond memories of the train to Agra were quickly forgotten. You are advised to arrive 1 hour before your train to allow time to get yourself to the right platform, but when we arrived at the station we saw that our train to Varanasi had been delayed by 3 hours. We spent most of the time sitting in a hotel next to the station drinking ice tea and milkshakes but sensed that we had overstayed our welcome. So we braved the train platform for the last hour. Besides the usual constant staring, we were also harassed by a group of young boys begging for money. We had already been told on many occasions not to give children any money or gifts as it teaches them bad habits around white tourists. We stood our ground but it was extremely upsetting to have small children tapping us, following us, shouting at us and eventually throwing things. All the while everyone else around was watching the whole ordeal not doing or saying anything. By this point we were desperate for the train to arrive.

When the train was about to come into the platform we had people trying to get us to go to different platforms which became very confusing and we became further flustered. Once sitting in the right seats on the right train FINALLY, we were squashed up with 2 security guards who squeezed in next to us (who are apparently allowed to sit anywhere they want). Things were definitely going from bad to worse. We were unable to sleep as there were people sitting on our beds, and we had no idea when our stop was. In our experience, trains in India rarely give any information at all about when the next stop will be or what stop it is. The trains also stop on the tracks at any moment for unknown reasons, sometimes adding hours to your journey.

Eventually, we arrived in Varanasi at 3.30am instead of 10pm, and good luck finally struck. Our hotel was clean and quiet, with air-con, bottled water and fresh towels.

Unfortunately, our experience in Allahabad was not great. However there was a small highlight, and that was the Indian Coffee House. We had been to one in Kochi so it was great to find another in the north. These coffee houses have a strong presence in Kerala, this is likely due to them being owned entirely by the workers (Marc was happy about this). Although sick boy only managed a couple of slices of toast, I thoroughly enjoyed my masala dosa. Maybe Allahabad isn't so bad after all.

Gymnastics at Baby Taj
Our first go at catching a train in India was surprisingly calm. Our platform was easy to find, the carriages well marked and the train not too crowded. As you navigate around the train station, it is hard to tell who is lying on the ground sleeping whilst waiting for a train and who is sleeping on the ground permanently. It is even harder to distinguish people who work at the train station and people who are trying to scam you for your money. Luckily we had been pre warned about scam artists insisting that our train was cancelled, delayed or that the platform had moved last minute so that they can offer you an alternative mode of transport at an extortionate price.

We sat in the air conditioned carriage where you have to book and pay for your ticket. There is also a general carriage where the train is free, but these carriages look very uncomfortable as people are squeezed into seats and can be seen hanging out of the doors and windows… sometimes for train journeys up to 50 hours long!

Three hours later we arrived at the heart of the Mughal empire, Agra. At our guesthouse
Baby Taj
we were welcomed by 2 goats who were tied up INSIDE the house. The family informed us that they were new goats and had been bought for the Muslim festival of Eid. The goats bring good karma before they are sacrificed.

Whilst on the topic of Indian goats, we have come to the conclusion that they have severe difficulty in differentiating between edible and non-edible substances, however get round this by choosing to eat mostly anything regardless of taste. This includes motorbikes, tree bark and brick walls.

Our tuk-tuk driver from the previous night, La La, had offered to pick us up at 5:30am and be our driver for the whole day for only 600 rupees (£6). We took him up on his offer and our first stop was the Taj Mahal. The selfie stick we had invested in before our trip finally came out in force. The title as the most beautiful building in the world is very much deserved and we could have spent all day wandering around the gardens. While Marc followed people around, who had paid a small fortune for their own tour guide, listening to the history behind the Taj Mahal, Susie appeared
Pride
more interested in the squirrels and monkeys. We also witnessed our first human versus monkey brawl over a camera.

Next it was off to Agra Fort. By now the sun had come up and the temperature started to soar. It is a much less humid heat up north which makes it slightly more bearable but still impossible to keep our t shirts dry. Like the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort was built during the era of the Mughal Empire but has also been occupied by the British. There are distinct architectural differences inside the fort as the original sandstone design was added to by the emperor Shah Jahan, who had a real craving for marble (also sanctioned Taj Mahal). This has left two different layers of the fort which is still used by the Indian Army today. There are a number of different buildings and mosques inside the fort which is referred to as a city inside a city. Only 25 per cent of the building is open to civilians due to its use by the army, which gives an insight into its scale. One Brit, Sir John Strachey, has left a lasting impression on the city of Agra after

undertaking the restoration of both Taj Mahal and Agra Fort after many years of decay.

In the afternoon we visited the Baby Taj (smaller but older and arguably more beautiful than the Taj Mahal) and the Mosque and Palace (Fatehpur Sikri) 40km north of Agra in the town of Sikri. The town is heavily influenced by the Mughals and has a strong Muslim heritage. When we arrived Marc was referred to by several of the younger boys as ‘Ali Baba’ due to his newly grown beard which apparently, you are only allowed if you are a holy man. The buildings are of particularly significance in the Muslim faith in India therefore it is easy to see why they are so well kept. However, this is in stark contrast to the surrounding areas where you can see and smell mounds of waste in amongst slum villages, which was certainly sad to see but not uncommon in areas throughout India.

Whilst visiting these amazing places, we were joined by many Indian tourists. We got quite a surprise the first time they came running over to us insisting on multiple photos with all members of their family. On one occasion at

All in all, it was a great and busy day before getting food. However, the first hitch of our journey had come about. We decided to make it easy and get a pizza hut after a long day exploring, only for Marc to get food poisoning! This was ironic given that our health had been unblemished throughout the two weeks of South Indian cuisine. It started to take its toll as we waited on the train to Allahabad and hit hard. It was a long 7 hour journey and not much sleep was had, for Marc anyway.

Dare a dip in the ganges

When we hear people talk about India, one of the first things they mention is the famous Ganges river. Even after hearing the stories, watching the documentaries and even reading various blogs on it, we knew we had to visit this holy city.

This is the city where Hindu's come to be put to rest. Like we said, we'd heard many of the stories and....well in all honesty for a long time we had been put off on coming to this place . Especially P! I mean who really wants to see the charred remains of someone floating down a river? Sorry to be soo blunt that's just what we heard.

Getting here should've been straight forward from Jaipur. We had the trains booked already and the tuk tuk ordered for the morning pick up. What could go wrong??

Well our first train was cancelled. This had us frantically trying to secure another ticket (hopefully with a seat) at the station for the next train. Eventually we secured a train 2 hours later and arrived in Delhi with a couple of hours to spare until our next train; the second leg
The holy city
of the journey from Delhi to Varanasi was just as confusing. Our tickets said Delhi on them and so we assumed it was from the Old Delhi station not realising there was also a New Delhi station!

Turns out we were at the wrong station. Why does this keep happening to us. We had 30 minutes before our trains departure! In usual Chris and P style, we made a mad dash to the metro station and arrived at Old Delhi station exhausted & sweaty with 2 mins to spare. Luck was with us once again. We managed to find our train which was running late. Saying that I never want to do that again. Running around (not jogging, literally running) trying to navigate busy walkways with our backpacks was challenging to say the least. We felt like our lungs were going to explode as we could barely catch our breaths. Catching a train in India just seems to be an ongoing nightmare - for us anyway.

Side note: There are direct trains available from Jaipur to Varanassi. Its just that going through Delhi and spending 5 hours there was the only route available the day we booked our
tickets.

Arriving in Varanasi, the scene was very much the same as in some of the busier cities we had visited in Rajasthan: rickshaws/autorickshaws, bikes/motorbikes, cows, many people going about their daily lives and fruits & veg sellers on the streets. The India we had came to know, hate and love.

After a quick clean up at the hostel we headed out and made a beeline for the closest ghat. We were based at the southern end of the ganges but it seemed all the 'action' took place in the north. Nevertheless we visited the Ghat around the corner from us - Assi Ghat. Nothing unusual to see, people just relaxing by the ganges from younger to older groups sat together, the odd holy man with long dreadlocks sat on their own at peace and the odd tourist here and there. It felt like a nice relaxing place for a local, unfortunately not as a tourist. There were a lot of boats here with boatmen selling way over inflated priced tours down the Ganges. With this unfortunately also came the hassle. Even after declining one offer to buy something or to take a boat ride, the next person
A bottle of ganges!
would see your attempt to relax as an invite to try harder and more insistently than the last.

They would always approach Chris with their extended hand, ask him where he was from and then proceed to massage his hand. It was their way of promoting their masseuse business if their first sale attempt of a boat ride failed.

Chris found himself wrestling his hand back on a number of occasions. P found it funny, she had already experienced this. It was now Chris's turn. We both laughed at the friendliness of the people here who seemed genuinely nice and at the same time would not let go of your hand.

The ganges was as we expected in some ways. Life here was based around the water. Even so, being here and taking it all in still had us amazed and intrigued. People were bathing in the Ganges, whilst others were brushing their teeth, swimming or washing their clothes in it. So many people just enjoying the river or making use of it in one way or another. Compared to what we expected it had a lovely ambience to it even thought it was a light shock
In the midst of it all
to see people seemingly bathing and drinking this water knowing what lies beneath these murky waters.

Prior to coming India we'd heard that there is special bacteria that 'eats bad bacteria' in the river - we were not quite sure how true that claim actually was and certainly did not want to try any of the above to test it out.

The main ghats in the north was a good 2 miles away from where we were staying. We decided we would walk it. We had barely walked 10 mins and were covered head to toe in our own sweat, the humidity here was sky high. In high season when the river is lower, its possible to walk beside the Ganges across all of the ghats but unfortunately for us it was monsoon season and the river was really high which made it impossible for anyone to walk north beyond the steps.

After catching a rickshaw near the main ghat, we worked our way through the exceptionally narrow maze of alleys. We had to squeeze past people queuing up at the entrance to a holy well at one point, with motorbikes pushing their way through too.
Charming young garland seller

We stopped by the famous lassi shop by the simple name of ""Blue Lassi"". The lassi's here were some of the best we'd ever tasted. P ordered apple whilst Chris ordered banana and apple. They were served in a round clay cup with a wooden spoon and pistachio nut sprinkled on top. We even made sure to return the following day for another one. Whilst enjoying our lassi we spotted a familiar face enter the small shop - Tamir - from Jaisalmer a few days ago! Due to the location of the shop, the seats face the narrow alleyway, so we just people watched as locals went about their daily business whilst slurping on our lassi's. From our seats we witnessed at least 4 bodies (wrapped up) being carried towards the cremation ghats. This must be a usual scene for the locals here. For us however as each group of men passed, carrying the wrapped elevated body above their heads singing and chanting as they passed, the hair on our arms stood on end.

We paid a visit to one of the cremation ghats and were led up the stairs of an old building overlooking the ghat by a

young man. From this viewpoint we could see everything - the ganges, the ghats, the decorated 'mummies' awaiting to be cremated, the bodies currently burning away on the funeral pyre and also the cows nearby, casually munching on garlands that were once draped over the deceased. Our self appointed 'guide' told us that up to 250 cremations happen here daily. He also pointed out the separate areas where the higher caste and the lower castes were cremated. People of lower castes were burned at the foot of the ghat right next to the river whereas the higher caste were cremated upon a higher platform. Surprisingly it didn't actually smell bad at all. We were told that the wood has a special quality of absorbing smells, which is why it's so expensive yet very much needed for cremations.

Holy men, children, pregnant women, people bitten by snakes and animals are not to be cremated. They are just 'sent' down the river. We didn't stick around for the corpses to be sent along the ganges though. We know what happens to some of them - bones (especially women's pelvic and mens sternum bones) are dragged ashore by dogs and 'feasted on'.
One of the best veggie curries we've tasted
This is the same river locals bathe and wash clothes in. I guess when the river is deemed holy it takes on another different meaning to have your clothes washed here.

As we were about to leave, our 'guide' motioned to an elderly woman sat at the doorway with her hand out. He said she needed money to buy wood and that we should donate some money for her to buy a kilo. We'd read about this scam however, she was not related to any of the deceased outside, it was just a way of trying to get money out of tourists and it was a lot she was asking for. Our 'guide' even tried guilt tripping us when we refused, telling us ""it's for the dead people"" when it was clearly not. Then he told us he works for a company who arrange funerals through donations for families who cannot afford this. We were not slightly fooled by this very insistent teen. We gave him a tip for the knowledge he shared earlier on and went on our way. Its actually quite disturbing that they'd use somebody else's families tragedy as an opportunity to gain for themselves.
The world famous Blue lassi shop

Speaking of opportunists, at one ghat we observed a couple of men in the ganges, heads emerging from the water and hands filled with 'gunk' from the river bed. We asked a local who we'd got speaking to what these men were doing. He told us that they were searching for jewellery and gold to sell to the jewellers. Bodies are sometimes burnt with some of their possessions, mainly jewellery. This is what the men in the water are looking for!

That evening at the ghat near our hotel we took a short half an hour paddle boat ride along the ganges which was nice, as we got to see Varanasi from a different perspective. During the boat ride we got talking briefly to 2 young locals lads who invited us to sit with them on the steps of the ghat afterwards. We're generally quite wary of any local being 'friendly' but gave these guys the benefit of the doubt, plus we were going to sit their anyway for the evening show. They even bought us some lemon (with spice) tea and sweetcorn as we chatted away. One of them did ask us to try out 'his' restaurant in
Another busy day by the river
Bathers, laundry & worshippers
the morning, we agreed we would but later on decided against going to anybody's new restaurant. Not after what happened in Udaipur and becoming ill. Surprisingly he wasn't too pushy with it.

So this show we mentioned. Not knowing much about it, we'd heard there would be men dancing with fire overlooking the ganges to traditional music. This sounded like it'd be fun. Evening Aarti as it is known apparently happens at a number of ghats at the same time each evening. What the show was and what we had in mind were 2 different things. We pictured dangerous, well practiced tricks, juggling fire or something but it turned out to be a more spiritual and religious affair. Three men dressed in golden robes on platforms slowly moved in unison whilst holding a golden chalice with smoke billowing out of it. They would face the ganges, hold their chalices up high and almost in a similar way to tai chi - turn around slowly into a crouching position. Many locals and domestic tourists sat amongst us on the steps watching this 20min performance. When it ended everyone followed the men down to the ganges; some people flicked water over
Shelter from a heavy downpour
themselves, others washed their feet (Chris dipped a toe in and then proceeded to splash P just imagined P's face when some landed on it. Not impressed). Although I guess that what we came for to get close to the Ganges. P bought a small basket filled with flowers and a candle in the middle from a charming young girl (who seemed well educated and spoke perfect English) and sent it off into the river. The basket is supposed to bring you luck.

The following day we opted for the slightly longer motor boat ride along the ganges. This would take us further up the ganges to parts we hadn't seen before and also one of the burning ghats we visited the day prior. A couple of indian tourists on our boat had collected themselves 2 big bottles of river water as a souvenir (a popular thing to do here). The views from the ganges were quite impressive as we took in all the buildings and unused ghats as well as the greenery on the opposite side of the river to the more rural areas of Varanasi.

We enjoyed our time in Varanasi but after 3 weeks of
Our first boat journey down the ganges
hectic India we were definitely looking forward to some relaxation and a slower pace in South India. We just hope we have more luck catching a plane here than we do with trains..

We jumped into this neat Innova , clean with plush interiors . The three of us were in a hurry to reach Baga Beach and of course come back within the 4 hours limit. Such a rush that we didn’t bother to take a picture of the Number plate of the car or even notice the driver. Such was our enthusiasm. Until the cabbie spoke up. So you girls want to look around or just go to the beach directly.

Two of us in the back seat giggled at being referred as “Girls”. Our friend in the front seat carrying the bazooka like camera answered …yes , but want to take some nice pictures too . And so you want me to smile, answered this cabbie . We laughed aloud and then we got talking. We were three friends meeting after 21 years , thanks to the Zuckerburg lad and his nice apps.

We were three women nearing forty , with families and kids , living in three different towns with just our school memories in common. And here we were heading towards the beach in the beautiful yet unknown place to us , for clicking pictures, reviving
91950c6
memories and ofcourse, creating new ones.

Beautiful houses painted in greens, blues, yellows and pinks with colourful gardens filled with lively furniture , colourful dresses and peaceful faces … that’s what I could see all around me. A place could actually be beautiful and peaceful and fun and yet not be a Bollywood set , that is so unbelievable and yet , so it was .This place was Goa .

Our cabbie was now our guide , he talked about the history , the churches and the plantations. With a lot of pride he discussed the administration , the roads , bridges , beaches and the resorts . Ofcourse we had to ask him about the flea markets and water sports and politely he told us to visit again when it was not Off Season.

That four hour visit to the beach and back was like a refresher course in the past and the present of Goa. For the three of us , this time not only was fun filled because of the beautiful sunset at beach and the gaiety and festivity around , it was also time to ponder .To think that at ten in the
91952e4
night , we three women are out on the beach , not feeling scared or agitated or frightened of being out at this hour , at an unknown place .

We reached back within our time frame , offered a tip to driver which he refused saying that hopefully our reunion will be a memorable one and that we should cherish these memories for life .



Oh Yes ! the memories are amazing , the place beautiful , the beaches clean and the town peaceful . And one more memory that we are taking back is of this Cabbie . .. A true gentleman with a clean soul , representing the spirit of Goa.

Day 36 - Varanasi - The Ganges

I was up and about at 7am this morning, I guess that's because I was in bed by 11pm! I am making the effort to look after my self, allowing my body what it needs to recover! In order to do this, I chose to miss another group social night! It's hard, not being a part of the social group, but I just can't do anything about that right now, as I have other priorities! But I do feel it changes the balance of the group for me.

I get on with everyone really well, but when the rest of the group spend time drinking and talking, on a few occasions, it is only natural that they become acquainted on a different level. The topics and things that are said, done, and experienced at these times, then spill over into conversations over the next few days.

As the only person not participating, I'm feel that I'm not on the same level, because I'm not aware of the events, then I'm not a part of the conversations.

I'm certainly not complaining about this, as its my priority to recover, so I
image
don't really have a choice, I'm just noting how it is impacting on my experience.

Our itinary has changed for Varanasi. Anu explained that because the train was so late getting in, we were too late to go to the evening flower ceremony on the Ganges. Also, because of the heavy rain, the boats are not going out on the Ganges anyway! Then for the same reason, we will not be going for the sunset either! None of this can be helped so you just have to be flexible.

We have plans to go to the final night of the auspicious flower ceremony tonight, but we will go to the ghat, not on a boat. That should be just as awesome, I'll let you know later.

I decided to pass time by going in for breakfast, in the only person in the restaurant so have all three waiters serving me... Lol Breakfast is good this morning. It usually is when it is a buffet breakfast.

I went back to bed for a little nap for an hour before meeting Anu for the days sightseeing.

We set off to a market in Varanasi, it really doesn't
image
have anything that I am interested in. We continue to the Ganges. It is so busy. We go to the cremation site where actual cremations are being done.

This visit is so different to my last experience, which is a good thing! The water is so high that it is unrecognisable to me. We went to one side of the ghat, but it is not possible to see, so we were taken through a maze of backstreets to climb a couple of flights of stairs where we can see really closely what is happening below. We had a really clear view of the cremation area.

I still got a very spiritual feeling, just by being there! Anu gave us a good explanation of a Hindu burial, and the 5 important parts of a Hindus life.

We continue our walk, stopping to get a lassi in a bit of shade. A much needed bit of shade, with a fan too. It is so hot right now!

We get back into the tuk tuks to go to the silk factories. I have done this tour before, but will join in as there is nothing else to do instead.
image


It was a short tour that took us to the co operative seller. I bought a silk bed set! I couldn't help myself! Anna bought a beautiful Saree, Bernie also got the bedding, Lisa went for the taffeta scarf. We were all happy to have finally bought something. Not forgetting that we all got a scarf for free as a gift!

Our tuk tuks were waiting outside to take us back to the hotel. We grab a bit of lunch, then have an hour to relax before setting off for the last auspicious ceremony later tonight.

It was a bad start, I was ready, but waiting for Anna, we finally got downstairs 10 minutes late. This meant we were late setting off!

We got going in our rickshaws. The street was so crazy with so many people, and traffic of all descriptions! But as I said earlier, this is the final evening ceremony in the auspicious month, therefore important.

At one point, the rickshaw that Anna and I were in nearly got lost amongst a huge tribe of lads! But we hung in there! The nearer we got to the Ganges, the more crazy busy
image
it got.

When we arrived, we met up with the G Yolo group and together we were ushered to a first class standing point!

I couldn't believe our luck! At first I was disappointed that we could not go on boats due to the rains, but with having such an awesome first visit in a boat, I really benefitted from my second visit being this way. The best of both worlds! it was so much better for me!

We were literally over top of the priests. I loved it! What a one off experience to be so close. So glad the rain came and stopped the boats!

We left before it finished in order to make our getaway a bit easier. It was a good job we did, as it certainly wasn't easy to get away! The traffic was so crazy, I know I am repeating myself, I suppose seeing, and hearing in this case, is believing!

We dropped off at a restaurant on the way back for our evening meal. I was whisked away by Bhoolchand to have my photo taken. I need it for my Nepal visa tomorrow. I did have one prepared,
image
but I used it to get my SIM card! The meal was very nice, I was really ready for it tonight. Another sign of my health improving I think.

Back to the hotel, an early night for all. We have a really early start tomorrow, we leave at 4.30am

Day 35 - Move to Varanasi

There are not many photos today as it has been a big travelling day!

Last night at about 10.30pm, we got on the night train to Varanasi. I got on, and straight into sleep mode. Anna, Anu and I are in one carriage, Lisa and Bernie are in the next carriage.

I have had a long sleep this afternoon, and into early evening. I have been up and around for an hour or so. I'm doing ok. I feel like there is a slow improvement the more sleep I have. After being on my feet for a couple of hours, I am so ready for the bed again!

Anu had helped me by carrying my bag, which has been a great help. Quite honestly, I'm not sure I could have done it! I am still a bit wobbly!

We got on the train as planned at 10.30, expecting to arrive at Varanasi at about lunchtime. It is now 3pm, and we are still not there. Anu told us that we are running about 5 hrs late. The problem is that it is a circular line, and two trains can't pass
image
each other, so one train had to wait off the line whilst the other one passes. It is this that has added to the ive hours. This is not unusual for trains in India!

I have slept most of the time, which can only be a good thing for me. I am still feeling the improvement, every time I wake up! So quite honestly, I certainly can't complain! I got my iPad out for Anna, so she can watch a film. Anything helps after this length of time!

I have had another nap! Anna had watched another film! This is the longest train journey ever! Just to remind you it was supposed to be about twelve hours, it has now been eighteen hours, and we are not there yet!

Lisa and Bernie have now joined us in our car, so I am thinking that is because we are getting near! I daren't hope!

Anu has just said to us that there has been a problem with the train. It could have been a head on collision. One of the drivers had seen that the driver of our train had missed the red stop light, he had
image
fallen asleep! It could have been a right issue! Luckily, the oncoming train was stopped. Apparently two men have been suspended, we could have been dead, so much better late than never!

We are able to walk over the road to the hotel, and a nice one it is too. We have a much needed coffee, then go off to our rooms.

Aw,... A comfy bed! Yes! We have a huge, full wall size window. I can see right across to the train station, lots of tuk tuks, people, bikes, cars, rickshaws etc. it's so busy out there. I can right a across town too!

We are meeting Anu at 7pm to go to a Nepalese family restaurant for our evening meal. I haven't eaten for two or three days now, so am ready for it!

I would suggest that I am at about 80% recovered, so will be taking it easy. No alcohol. I think I will be better in the morning after a good nights sleep. It is all the sleep I have had that is helping me to recover! I can not afford to have any more accidents!

We meet at 7pm
image
to go for our evening meal. We are going to El Parador. It is a family ran restaurant. I actually ate here the last time I was in Varanasi. I remember the mint tea, not the food, which is weird!

Whilst waiting for the food, everyone is recounting over the drunken evening. I feel missed a really good night! Anu is trying to explain some of the funny comments that he made when drinking! The girls are all laughing with him! It seems like they had such a good time! The girls are making Anu worried about the things he has said and done, but they are only playing with him! Lol

The meal was really good tonight. It's the first proper meal I have had for about three days. I was so hungry. We all enjoyed our food tonight. Good guidance Anu!

We return to our hotel. A pre bedtime drink for all. I stick to a lassi, I just need to look after myself for the next few days! So. With that in mind, I am continuing to be sensible.... I leave the group early, and go to bed.

I am looking forward to
image
100% recovery tomorrow... Hopefully!

Day 32 - Move on to Agra - Taj Mahal and Agra Fort

Mornings are going well. Up and put in good time. Anna and I are working well with each other in the mornings. We got our bags packed, and left the outside the reception before going in for breakfast. Lisa and Bernie joined us about ten minutes later.

It's been really good staying in Bissau Palace Hotel. It actually was a palace, many years ago. It is still owned, and managed by the Bissau family. Everything was good there, and here's the but.... The tap dripped all night, it drive both Anna and I nutty! The second thing was the useless wifi, but that could just be an, 'India' thing, so although it drove me crazy when trying to do the blog, I can't really complain about that. I just had to accept it! Depending how well you know me, you would understand how that would affect me!

Breakfast done, bags in, and on the car, we set off on the five hour drive to Agra. We are going to Agra Fort, but like yesterday, I can't remember it right now, but I'm sure when I
image
get there, it will all come flooding back!

Then we are going to Taj Mahal. There were two points in my first trip to India that really took my breath away, one of them being Taj. I am so excited to be revisiting. My head space wasn't good this time last year, so I am looking forward to seeing it again.... With a happy head!

Yesterday, Anu was telling us our Itinary, I was so pleased not to be going at sunset. Don't misunderstand me, sunset at Taj was breathtakingly beautiful, but that first visit can never be replaced. The fact that we are going at a different time, with a new group, without Ankur, but with Anu..... This will make it a completely new visit! I think that may be a complicated thought, but it works for me!

First stop after two hours, all four of us are sleeping the whole time, a cold drink and a comfort break, three hours to go!

The next three hours passed ok, I didn't sleep for this session, just did a lot of window gazing. I did think to myself that I wish I hadn't of deleted Candy
image
Crush, it would come in useful. I deleted it to make more space on my phone for pictures, which was a priority!

Before going to the fort, Anu gave us an option of lunch now, or after the visit. I requested coffee and toilet, I'm not really needing food right now. The rest of the group agreed. We stopped at Costa Coffee... Woop woop ... I'm happy, there's a coffee cooler with my name on it!

Then as we stopped, I realised that I recognise this place! It was the same Costa and hotel that I stayed at last time. I was drowning in my happy memories again... Ahhh.

There were lots of police lining the road. Anu explained that a group of VIPs (from ISAC organisation) were going to pass through, so all the roads were now cut off, no one was allowed in the streets. We had to stay put until they passed, with lots of escorts, both in front, and behind. Hmmm... Positives all round!

When they had all passed we continued to Agra Fort. Again, like yesterday, I know I've already been, but I do need my memory refreshing. Anu led the
image
tour around. He was really good too! His skills in history are definitely one of his strengths, amongst others! Some bits of information came back to me, but not a lot! Therefore I thoroughly enjoyed getting that information all over again. Anu did a great job for us at the fort.

We got a sneak glimpse at Taj... Woop woop.... I'm feeling the excitement and emotional already!

We went for lunch straight from the fort. Lisa and I chose the Chinese option of vegetable chowmein. It's seemed like a welcome change!... And I enjoyed it too!

On to Taj Mahal. On the approach it's just as awesome as ever. I could just sit and look at it from a distance. It's impossible to put it into words how amazing it is; the building, the history, the love and compassion that brought it to be.... Just the whole package!

I wish I had just sat and looked at it; we visited late in the afternoon. It was so busy, I felt like a cow being herded along. It was so busy that you actually couldn't see anything inside. Anna and I got crushed and pushed by a
image
group of old ladies in sarees! Unbelievable, we held our respect, and got out ... eventually! It was beginning to spoil it for me, so I decided to keep my memory of my last visit, and leave early. Anna also felt that the crowds were just too much, so we left together. We felt that we had seen what we needed to.

I still loved that I went to see it again, but it was not as good as I had expected, that was due to the sheer amount if people.

We got to the hotel; first job, a shower. Oh, how nice that shower was! I got changed and ready so I could go into reception to upload my pics for the blog .... Using wifi. Leaving Snna the time and space she needed, as she wanted a really long shower!

I'm struggling keeping the blog up without Internet, but Anu has really tried hard for me, but it's just not happening for me!

We went out for snacks at a place called Sheroes. It's really quite an inspirational set up. It is run as a support step for woman who have suffered from acid
image
attacks. It offers them the opportunity to regain confidence to move on in their lives. Really pleased to have gone there!

We all decide to go with Anu for a drink before going back to the hotel. We went to a bar which is only a short walk from the hotel, Madira Bar in the Hotel Amar.

Another good day 😍

7.30 start tomorrow.

All marble
Before we'd even decided to go to India we could never really figure out what the big deal was when it came to the Taj Mahal. Yes it looked grand and the story behind it (from what we knew at that time) was a heart-warming romantic gesture but what was so great about it?. We'd heard how some people even shed a tear when they'd seen it because of its sheer beauty, some saying it’s the most beautiful thing they'd ever laid eyes on. We were dubious, it can’t be THAT amazing of a building can it?? Of course, you cannot go to India and not visit one of the great wonders of the world. Is it as impressive as everyone says it is? Was it really beautiful? Did we shed a tear?


At Delhi train station, we avoided the irritating ""Have you got a ticket?"" scammers outside of the station and entered the main hall and looked at the train information board. We couldn't see our train number anywhere and our train was due to leave in 10minutes. Why was it not up there? After asking around and being pointed to the wrong platform (by an official)
Symmetry
we managed to find our train and designated sleeper seats in time. The 3 hour journey wasn't bad at all, although we did wish we booked the side berth seats instead of the 3rd upper berth. The side berths looked so comfy. None of the horror stories of thieves and mice were to be found however, we actually found it quite pleasant and likened it to our train rides in China. P even enjoyed some chai tea and biscuits on board. There were a few instances where severely disabled or visibly homeless people came round the train as it set off, crawling due to their disabilities and begging for money from passengers. As we'd read and heard before coming to India, the poverty here is heart wrenching. Chris mentioned how not too long ago India spent $74 million on a space mission. Whilst an outstanding achievement for India, we thought about how that money could've been better spent on the people here in India who need it the most. During the journey we also witnessed a eunuch (a castrated male dressed as a woman in a sari) clapping her hands and demanding money from certain passengers. We just kept our
Eye spy
heads down as she started clapping in the face of one man sat next to Chris, and watched the poor guy dig into his pocket to pay for her to leave and not curse him. Luckily she left us alone.

The following day in Agra, we woke up at 5am. Moving around our stuffy hostel room in a haze we hurriedly got ready, we'd heard the best time to view the Taj Mahal is at sunrise. It was still so dark outside. The best spot to view the palace at sunrise is actually from Agra fort, some 2km away. Unable to secure a reasonable price with a rickshaw to see all the sites we made our way straight to the Taj Mahal. Luckily for us our hostel was well situated, only a 5 minute walk from South gate of the palace, which you could also see from our roof terrace. On the way there Chris accidentally stepped on some roadkill and felt a soft bloat underfoot. It let out a weak squeal as Chris looked down and leapt in the air as he saw the poor flattened rat.

Due to it being low season and early
View from the outside
morning the crowds weren't too big and the air was cool. Stood in a large courtyard we could see through the opening of an archway, there it was in the distance -

the Taj Mahal.

Just as we were about to enter we bumped into a French guy we had met from all the way back in Indonesia (Mt Ijen to be precise). For the life of us we couldn't remember his name or where it was exactly we knew him from. He remembered our names and everything! We spoke briefly about travels since our last encounter but it wasn't until after we'd departed that we remembered where we'd known him from - shame on us! Apologies if your reading this.

We passed through the red brick archway, with its white writing in Arabic climbing up it we entered the gardens of the Taj Mahal. The view was amazing. The symmetry of it all was outstanding, the reflective lake and the rows of trees alongside it all brought your focus directly to the white marble structure before us. Even the 2 red buildings on either side of it enhanced the imagery - one a
Stunning architecture
mosque, the other built just to complete the symmetry. Sadly we didn't shed a tear but it did take our breath away. It was true what people said about the Taj, it is stunning and it really is hard to take your eyes off it.

Further in we posed at the famous bench where Princess Diana was supposed to have had her picture taken. Many camera toting touts spent their time convincing and arranging visitors in positions mirroring Lady Di's pose amongst many others.

Before entering the palace we strolled around the outside area taking in the angles and visiting the mosque. Regretting not getting a guide, we took a seat facing the taj and pulled out our trusty guide book for some facts and info on just what exactly we were looking at. The Taj Mahal, a mausoleum, was built by sultan Shah Jahan in 1632 in memory of 3rd wife who died giving birth to his 14th child. The romance in it, is kind of lost when you hear it was her 14th child, you couldn't help but think ""that poor woman"" surely they would have stopped earlier given the increased risks. The grand
Nap time at the Taj
gesture though almost overshadows the unfortunate event as you can see the workmanship that has gone into creating such a masterpiece. Just like the entrance gate, the whole of the palace is covered in intricate carvings and large writing. Apparently the writing gets bigger the higher it goes to create the effect of it all being the same size when looking from the ground up. Inside there are 2 tombs - one for the sultans wife and one for him. These are both fake, the real ones are buried deep underneath. Not available for public viewing.

After spending a couple hours at the palace we took a rickshaw to Agra fort. The huge fort, built in 1565 with huge red bricks stuck together with an interesting mix of natural adhesives by the grandfather of shah Jahan’s deceased wife. It was originally a military fort, but grand palaces were also added inside later on. Outside we teamed up with a group of 4 young lads from the UK to share the cost of a guide.

Our guide was very informative albeit a bit fast as he talked and walked us through areas of the complex. He pointed
Reflections in the fountain
out the old dry moat which used to be filled with lions and tigers, and this moat used to be surrounded by a water moat filled with crocodiles. Nobody was entering here unannounced.

Saying that, part of the fort was actually destroyed by angry Hindu villagers (with the help of the newly arrived British), as the sultan at the time was trying to convert everyone to Islam. There's even a hole where one cannon ball hit a marble structure and allegedly bounced backwards cracking an onyx stone platform, where the sultan usually sat. We passed through many courtyards, areas where public audiences were held and white grand marble palaces. One courtyard with black and white squares was actually used by the king to play chess...with real people!

An interesting part of the tour was when the guide pointed out where Shah Jahan (who built the Taj Mahal) and one of his daughters were imprisoned (house arrest) by his son for making the town nearly bankrupt from building the Taj mahal. This son was later killed by a brother who wanted to ascend to the throne, quicker. Oh the irony of it all. The Taj Mahal seemingly
Beautiful colours
built on romance but shrowded in lots of deep dark family issues.

Both rooms were not dingy by any means and also had amazing views of the taj mahal. Great in our opinion but no so great for the sultan who could only admire his work and memory of his wife from a distance.

Two amazing sites down and it was only 10:30am, the sun was beaming down too. We stopped by a small street food stall for some shade and a drink. P also ordered a veg thali whilst Chris gave it a miss due to stomach trouble the day before.

Negotiating a price with a rickshaw driver, we mistakenly asked him to take us to Mehtab Bagh which we thought was the 'Baby Taj'. Mehtab Bagh is actually a park along the river Yamuna, directly behind the Taj. It still felt amazing seeing the Taj a second time from a completely different angle and without many other tourists. We had just had enough off paying entrance fees by that point. It was starting to be an expensive day. I thought everyone said India was a cheap place. Not Agra if you visit
Early morning Taj
most sights.

The gardens are said to be perfectly aligned with the Taj gardens, something we guess is only really visible via an Ariel view. There wasn't much else to the park other than the gardens, although there were a lot of old brick ruins which made us question the black marble Taj rumour.

It’s said that Shah Jahan wanted to build mirror image of the Taj (for himself) in black marble directly opposite the white Taj but ran out of money. The theory's even backed by the fact he bought the land shortly before being imprisoned.

With the same rickshaw driver, we again negotiated another price to take us to 'Baby Taj' only. We wanted a total sum for him to take us there and then back to our hostel but his asking price was too high.

Baby Taj's real name is Itimad-ud-Daulah. The nickname 'Baby Taj' stems from the fact that it’s another white marble mausoleum and is a lot smaller than the grand Taj Mahal. What we didn't know was that this one was built before the Taj, for the same sultan who built Agra fort by his daughter.
Taj Mahal
Where it lacked the jaw dropping scale of the Taj it made up in intricacy. The coloured patterns and writing on the outside was the work of some very talented masons.

It was lovely to walk around and admire this beauty but in the sun the marble floors were very hot. It was excruciating to run across the marble tiles to collect our flip flops when stepping back outside. Stupid tender western feet.

At this point of the day we were slightly tired from the early wake and the constant exploring so we took a breather at one of the four gates surrounding Baby Taj (the one overlooking the river). On the platform below us, there were some local lads jumping in and out of the river, performing tricks and pushing each other in. We watched in amusement.

As soon as they noticed our peering eyes they performed their tricks with even more enthusiasm shouting up to us and a Chinese traveller ""I love you"" , asking us to come down to swim with them. The river was not exactly inviting, it was a dirty looking murky colour and on the other side of
Views from the entrance
it we saw some water buffalo washing in it. No not for us.

Soon after, these guys started shouting up asking for water but as they joked around we wasn't exactly sure whether they were being serious or not. As the chinese guy next to us had a bottle he threw it to them and the 4 guys shared it and gulped at it like they were desperately thirsty. The fun and laughter stopped for us as our eyes drifted to their belongings under the bridge. It suddenly dawned on us that these guys really needed the water and were living underneath the Baby Taj complex.

Before we just saw a group of young lads having fun, now we saw a group of young lads living in poverty with limited access to water. These guys somehow appeared to get by and they certainly didn’t need our pity but we couldn't help but ask ourselves 'what had these guys like many others done to be in such a rut?'. Nothing. They were just born into poverty with limited opportunities to make a good wage for themselves. They carried on happily entertaining themselves and each other as we
Red sandstone fort
silently left them to it.

Hot, tired and silenced by our reflectiveness we hopped into our waiting rickshaw to take us back to our hostel. For the whole day we only spent 300 rupees in terms of transportation. We were quoted 700 that same morning by a few different drivers, so it definitely worked out a lot better for us to do it all separately.

In the evening we got lost in the many busy cow filled alleys, watching young and old street sellers alike with their wooden carriages filled with fruit and vegetables. Women sometimes sitting behind windows with their sewing machines. Afterwards we rested a little to prepare ourselves mentally for our first overnight train in India...sleeping in sleeper class. The lowest form of sleeping class.

There is however a class lower without beds or chairs where people scramble to get the best floors spots (if such a thing exits) but we decided we would settle on the slightly dirty, sheet less fan cooled- albeit sleeper berth.

Entering the train station in Agra took us by surprise. We understood the streets were chaotic but the train stations too!! We couldn’t
Taj Mahal from the Agra fort
believe our eyes..

It felt almost like a zoo, monkeys running up and down the stairs chasing each other across the bridge, up onto the train station's interior. They were everywhere and also frightening in appearance, scarred from all the fighting. You could certainly see that it was every monkey for themselves as they scrapped over rubbish and food thrown onto the tracks.





Then there were the dogs who were extremely territorial becoming vicious towards one another if one so happened to enter their patch. If this wasn’t enough there was hundreds of rats running up and down the rails. They were huge.

Whilst we were waiting for our train, we watched as many trains came and went. As they stopped many released their toilet waste onto the tracks. Fluid gushed out then trickled and trickled before our eyes. Not to worry the rats cleaned some of it up.

After these trains left, instead of climbing the stairs and walking the bridge, people casually stepped down onto the tracks to cross it and climb onto the opposite platform. It wasn’t necessary with the bridge but so many people did it.
The intricately carved 'Baby Taj'
We couldn't quite get our heads around this.

All that traffic on the tracks: trains, dogs, monkeys, rats and humans you would think it would be fatal. Nope, everything survived the trains by an inch. We watched in shock and somewhat horror as we waited.

A slightly entertaining thing to watch was how clever the monkeys were at getting their own entertainment. They would climb down from higher platforms creep up on a dog, pull it's tail and be chased away them. After the dog got bored of trying to catch the monkeys the had climbed out of reach, get this. They did it again. We were stunned. Poor dogs who could never catch these cheeky monkeys.

Slowly as we waited, every inch of the platform we sat on was being filled up, masses of people sat waiting for a train. With so many trains coming and going we questioned whether they were waiting for the same train.

We were getting slightly nervous as there was no indication of whether we were at he right place or not. Our train was initially on our platform screen but then disappeared. No warning like
Just before we met the locals by the river
others that it would be late. We asked around but no-one understood us so we waited where we thought we oughta be.

The departure time for the train came and went. Great. We needed to see whether it was late or whether we had missed it.

We asked some local people who smiled at us, sometimes repeating the destination of Bundi but not having a clue on what we had just said. We spotted some sort of train officials and ran to them to ask whether we had missed our train. They asked us what train it was. We took out our tickets they replied 'yes'. Yes we had missed it?. We attempted to clarify this by asking whether it was it still coming?. The guy once again replied 'yes'.

Did he understand us?? We hope so. We asked what time the train was due. He said the arrival time. We again showed him our tickets. He replied 6:30pm.

It was nearly 7pm.

We stressed that this time had gone. He was baffled (confused). We gave up and found someone else who reassured us that the train was due at
Views from our hostel
the time listed on the tickets and the internet. AHHH.

Had we missed our train or not?. We decided to wait it out, slightly stressed by it all. We couldn't comprehend whether each train arriving was ours or not.

We believed we may have heard the word ‘Bundi’ in the announcement of one train that arrived over an hr later than the scheduled time of our train. We couldn't be sure if it was ours. We hopped on but then doubted ourselves. Chris ran off the train looking for another official P ran through the carriages. No one could help. As the train started moving Chris hopped back on and we found our seats. We decided we would chance it as we sweated profusely under the stress. Shortly after a ticket conductor checked our tickets and said nothing. Phew, that must have meant we were on the right train.

What a kerfuffle. Every traveller we had met on the road in South East Asia all who had travelled to India told us 'everyone' speaks English so we didn't need to worry about learning another language. Well not here. Were we missing something?

Taking in the view
Were we tired and wanted to settle down in preparation of what was to be a very sweaty and disruptive night's sleep. We couldn't complain, we only paid pennies even if we did leave a little smellier than we started out.

Transportation: Overnight train from Agra to Bundi. Sleeper Class 329 rupees each (booked through clear trip) taking just over 12 hours.
Accommodation: Hotel Sidharta (hostel).

Taj Mahal
I boarded the train at Sawai Madhopur in general class, which was “packed”!! The people were friendly enough to arrange a space for me to sit on a top bed, which was great. I was happy I was in this train for just about 3.5 hours because it wasn't too comfortable. But it was an experience! People were lying all over the floor, squeezing together on the beds etc. I was happy it didn’t stink!

After changing trains once, I arrived in Agra which has about 2 million inhabitants and is mostly famous for the Taj Mahal. I arrived around 10am and the original idea was to leave my bag in a locker at the station, visit the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort and catch a train later that evening to Varanasi. It didn’t work out because there was no trains available to Varanasi that day. Everything was full! This rickshaw driver said he’ll take me to a travel-agent who could arrange something. Once there, this guy wanted to sell me a ticket in “general” section for 1200 Rupees. I asked him if he was out of his mind and I left the office. I went back to the station
Sunrise above the Ganges River, Varanasi
and it started to rain and it would be raining and storming on and off for the rest of the day, so visiting Taj Mahal and leave in the evening wouldn’t be an option anyway.

At the station I booked a train to Varanasi for the next day and also a train from Varanasi to New Delhi for a couple of days later. That was also a problem because the trains were full. The only option they had, was on a waiting list from Mughal Sarai (about 10km outside Varanasi) to New Delhi. I decided to purchase that one, then grabbed a rickshaw to the guesthouse where I stayed. The next day I woke up early for breakfast and then left to Taj Mahal, together with a French guy who was also staying at the guesthouse. It was about a 10 minute walk and we arrived around 6:45 at the Taj Mahal. It wasn’t busy at all, so we quickly got our tickets and entered. The Taj Mahal is India’s most famous landmark and was completely built out of marble. It was built in mid-17th century by Shah Jahan (emperor), who wanted to build a mausoleum to house

the tomb to his third wife. The building is impressive and the garden is beautiful! Since there wasn’t a lot of people yet, it was easy to take pictures without having to wait too long for your turn to pose in front of the building. After a few shots, we walked towards the building itself and went inside, which was not impressive at all. But after all, it was a place I wanted to see so I can tick it off my bucket list. After this we went back to the guesthouse to rest a little bit, before going to Agra Fort. This big complex was built in the 11th century but more parts were added afterwards. It’s like a little city with a city wall around it and with palaces, halls, gardens, baths etc. inside. Several royals and emperor lived here throughout the years, from where they ruled the country. There has been several invasions and battles to conquer the fort during those years.

In the evening I took a train to Varanasi and I was in the 3rd class sleeper, non-air conditioning. It took about 10 hours to arrive in Varanasi. Once there, the rickshaw drivers

start bothering you the moment you step out of the train. They were all over the platform and they asked me if I needed a rickshaw. I told one of them that they always try to charge double the price and that’s why I dislike them. Then he said “no no, I give Indian price, around 70 Rupees” bla bla bla. I kept walking and went outside of the station, and there he was again. I decided to tell him where I was staying and asked how much it would cost. He told me to call the hostel and ask, which I did and they told me it should be maximum 100 Rupees. I told the driver this and he said “ok, let’s go”. Once I arrived at the hostel, I gave him a 100 Rupees bill and he said “no no, not good” and gave it back to me. I asked him what’s wrong and he said “150 Rupees”. I told him that we agreed for a 100 and that he’s not getting a single Rupee more than that. I was angry at this time, told him to f*** off and that they should stop doing these kind of
Taj Mahal entrance
things all the time. Pisses me off, seriously!

Varanasi (or Benares) lies on the Ganges River and has more than 1 million people. It’s the holiest city in Hinduism and you’ll notice that because of the amount of cows on the street. For me, Varanasi was the exact image of India I had in my mind, especially when I was much younger: “Very busy, a bit dirty, cows everywhere (and cow poop), people bathing, washing etc. in the Ganges River”. Varanasi was just a CRAZY place, let me tell you! But it has to be included in your itinerary through India. I was still a bit tired after my arrival. First I went outside on the main street to get some food and I had to go to the ATM as well. I booked a boat trip with the hostel for sunset (and for sunrise the next day) and then I had a nap. Later in the afternoon I walked towards Dasaswamedh Ghat together with a few other guests, where we boarded the boat on the Ganges River. There are several ghats (staircases down the river) along the Ganges, each with their own name. Some ghats are used as
Taj Mahal
cremation sites. This is one of the most bizarre things I’ve ever seen! They believe that being cremated at the Ganges is a favourable place for this rite of passage, since it’s considered the most sacred river in Hinduism. The bodies are wrapped into a white cloth and put on top of some wood, and they put wood on top of the bodies too. That’s how the bodies are burned and the ashes thrown into the Ganges! Pictures are not allowed, but from the boat it is possible. Another day I went to another cremation ghat where one of the bodies wasn’t completely wrapped. The head of this older lady was completely visible, wow!! Except for tourists, women are not allowed near the cremation sites.

The boat ride during sunset was very good. There was a guy at the front rowing our way on the Ganges. When going back to Dasaswamedh Ghat, the daily “Aarti ceremony” already started. It’s a religious worship ritual in Hinduism and there was a lot of people, also on the boats in front of the ghat. We also stayed and watched the ceremony for a bit more than half an hour before getting
Taj Mahal
off the boat.

The next morning I woke up before 5am to go to the sunrise boat trip. I enjoyed this one better than the one during sunset. Once the sun came out I was able to take some excellent shots of the sun rising from the east and the whole colourful waterfront and the ghats looked so much better. Some ghats were already quite busy with people bathing, washing etc., everyone doing their own thing. Later that day I took a “Champissage”, a traditional Indian head-and face massage and it was a “funny” experience. I wandered around the busy streets of Varanasi (the traffic is MENTAL), then took a right when I arrived at Dasaswamedh Ghat. Here I just wandered slowly, speaking to some people, watching a bit of cricket (they allowed me to bowl a couple of times too). At Harishchandra Ghat I just sat down and watched the cremation, while speaking to some other people. I slowly made it back to the hostel after this, where I hung out with several other travellers until late. The next day was my last day in Varanasi, since I was going to leave in the evening. In the
Taj Mahal
afternoon I walked around a little, with a guest from the hostel, and this time at Dasaswamedh Ghat I took a left and we slowly walked all the way until Manikarnika Ghat, the main cremation ghat. Like everywhere else in India, we were constantly approached by people asking “where are you from” etc. They seem to just want to have a chat, but it always turns out into asking for money, donation, take a look at their shop etc. So annoying! Beside the ghats, there are some temples in Varanasi but I was at a stage where I had more than enough of temples etc. At the hostel I met with MJ from Washington DC, a girl who is travelling through Asia independently despite of the fact that she's deaf-mute! We interacted by writing on her phone and showing each other. She's such an inspiration!! 😊

Later in the afternoon I started to feel a bit strange. I walked back to the hostel around 6pm. The feeling got worse and I had to go to the toilet because of diarrhoea; then I had to go again. A bit later I threw up twice in the toilet, which immediately made
View of Yamuna River, behind Taj Mahal
me feel much better but the diarrhoea didn’t stop. This happened because of a fresh salad I ate at a restaurant earlier that day. I left the hostel just before midnight to go to Mughalsarai, where I had to board my train to New Delhi and I obviously wasn’t feeling a 100%. I got to the station and walked all the way to the last platform where my train was departing from. Once there, they told me that I was on the waiting list (I completely forgot that) and that I couldn’t board the train. I had to go and cancel the ticket to get a refund. I was tired and a bit weak, but I had to move on. I walked back to the counter, had to go to platform 2 to cancel the ticket and back, then I and got my refund. I asked when the next train to New Delhi was and they sold me a “general” ticket and there was no way I was going to sit for so long in packed wagon. He said I should approach the employees on the train and pay them extra for an upgrade. I got a ticket for this
Taj Mahal
train that had a 4 hour delay, meaning that it should be arriving in about half an hour (2:15am). Wishful thinking; the train did not come! I was so tired and not feeling well. I had to go to the toilet twice. I carried all my things to this waiting room and asked this friendly-looking couple and their baby, if they could please look after my stuff while I went to the toilet. The train came at 7:15am!!! Once on board, I paid and got an upgrade (thank God) in sleeper 3rd class with air-conditioning. On board I had to go to the toilet very often and I didn’t eat much. The train was constantly stopping in the middle of nowhere and most of the times it was going slow. It took 19 hours to arrive in New Delhi, what a hell of a ride! I got off the train in New Delhi at 1:30am.

New Delhi is the capital of India with about 13 million inhabitants. Luckily enough my guesthouse was pretty close to the station, but I took a rickshaw because I was feeling way too weak and tired to walk. At the guesthouse I immediately
Taj Mahal
went to bed, but often waking up to go to the toilet. In the morning I had a shower and went for breakfast. I bought sachets of ORS (recommended by a former class mates from Curaçao who is a doctor now) to help me rehydrate. I wasn’t in the mood of doing much exploring so I didn’t see everything I wanted to see in New Delhi. I walked to the metro station and went to Connaught Place where I met with Chandan, who I used to work with at Mc Donald’s in Darwin, Australia back in 2008. Working with Chandan meant a lot of laughing and fun in the kitchen. I didn’t stay with him because he lives a bit outside of the city, so it wasn’t convenient. We wandered around Connaught Place and went to Palika Bazar, which was underground. Later Chandan drove to the Gate of India, which was built to honour Indian soldiers who died in World War I. Then we drove to Raj Ghat, a memorial to Mahathma Gandhi and where he was cremated. Mahathma is considered the “father of the nation” since he led India to independence from the UK and he appears on every
Taj Mahal
single Rupee banknote. The next day I went to Indira Gandhi Memorial, the house of India’s first and so far only female prime-minister. Indira was shot to dead in 1984 in her garden by one of her own body guards. The house is now a museum, showing many newspaper articles about Indira’s political achievements and her original clothes, bedroom, study-room etc. The last few metres where she walked before being was shot, are now covered by glass. After this, I took a metro to Gurgaon where I met with Chandan for some dinner and beers with a friend of him. Then I made my way back to the guesthouse and left India the next day, after spending five weeks in the country.

Incredible India, great experience except for the last five days. I’d definitely recommend visiting India but you need be “mentally” prepared for a possible culture shock; the traffic, the filth, the crowdedness. I handled it very well. India was among my top-5 countries I really wanted to visit and I'm happy I finally did! I would like to visit again someday in the future to see more of the country but I think five weeks at

a time was just enough for me. I was slowly getting very annoyed by all the touts, people approaching you on the street etc. Next stop will be one of the “Stan’s”!

March 12th 2015
Published: March 12th 2015


In love with Varanasi
Varanasi - oldest then any other still inhabited city in the world. Some believe, that death in Varanasi brings salvation. For me, Varanasi felt older then life.
I was lucky, since the city was gentle and more than good to me. It allowed me to meet one of the nicest, wisest and funniest people I ever met. For that, I'm very much thankful.
For a short time during this trip, I felt almost at home at Assi Ghat. If there is one place in India I'd like to come back to, it would be Varanasi and it's very special people I feel privileged to meet.

I've been thinking what was that different from other cities in India (except Varanasi being - well - Varanasi). I realized, it's the people. We had the best guide ever - working for many European and American photographers and directors, he understands our culture much better than any other guides I met in India or SE Asia. It makes a huge difference: not being rushed from one tourist point to another, and being able to relax - because you know there is somebody taking care of it all (and not letting you get run over
Morning walk
by a rickshaw or a cow for that matter).

This way, we slowly met his friends too (the chai wallah, the little brahmin, our green T-shirt friend😊 and countless others. I'm not using their names, since I'm not sure if they'd like it.). After a couple of days, I started to call them our little Assi-Ghat gang.

I'm trying to sort out my memories of the most memorable moments from this Visit - but they are so many! The little ""picnic"" on the Ganga's river, the family visits, the evening long chai-drinking discussions, the photo-sessions, dinners, the evening Aarti ceremony, the little prayer-candles-gift, the Holi-festival of colours... I'm sure I'm forgetting many more right now.

One think I can write clearly though - if you ever visit India, or especially Varanasi and look for somebody who will not rush you from one point to another, or if you are a photographer or director coming there to work on your project - I have the best guide for you. Perhaps the only one who can say tourists are coming back for him more than for the city itself. (I really think he has a waiting list by now,
Monkey on a bike
Monkeys are the bosses. And they know it.
he just didn't tell us.😊)
So just send me a message. I'll be happy to link you to his Facebook site.

Many people say, Varanasi is about death. They mention the pollution of the river and the streets, the ashes, the ever present chaos and noise. For me, the city of light was about friendship, life, beliefs and feeling welcomed. I believe, it's the people we met who made the difference, and for that I'd always thank them.

The White Jewel of Agra
So it’s been three wonderful days in Jaipur and right now, I’m on the train to Agra. This is and will be most probably the only time in the 1AC (seating) car in India, so I’m rather enjoying it. We have the whole 56 seats car for us and another 5 passengers. Such a luxury in India.

I got massala chai, which was delicious with the Nepal-honey from the nice gentleman back at the hotel. Richard is catching up on sleep, since we had to get up before 6am.

The only downside of the location of our hotel in Jaipur was that since it was in the muslim part of the city, you hear the prayers from the mosque every couple of hours - unused to it as we are, it woke me up each couple of times during the night.

The other issue we faced yesterday was discovering that two bottles of mineral water we bought were probably refilled, since the top of the cap was cut (between the top and the side of the closing lid, as to leave the seal intact). The other two weren’t. We bought all of them in the same pharmacy. I
Faces of Taj Mahal
don’t know. We still feel alright, so there is a small chance it was just a defect one (or to be precise, two), but it was such a clean cut and with ca 1 cm still at place, I don’t know. Might really be just another way to refill the bottles.

Not worth the risk, we took some medication just in case and hoped - once again - for the best.



Oh, the food arrived. It even looks harmless, so I guess, I give it a go. I’d probably won’t have much chances to do so after arriving in Uttar-Pradesh. (Desert state or not, I miss Rajasthan already.)

Did you ever had pasteurised hot (and I mean almost boiling) milk mixed with boiling water with cornflakes?



The conductor arrived as well.

Lesson one - don’t give the train tickets to Richard, on a train, when he decides to take a nap. Once I’ll need to show them to somebody, it won’t be possible to wake him up. (Or at least he would pretend so, it seems like he enjoys these jokes.)

----
So here we are.

Agra, Uttar Pradesh
Beautiful people
At the first sight, I thought I met Anushka Sharma. And her saree was stunning too.
- the place of the last remaining world's wonder - Taj Mahal. To be honest, Taj shines like a lost white pearl.
Unfortunately, we didn't have much time to see anything beyond it (perhaps with the exception of the Red Fort), not even the Gwalior. But we were lucky enough to make a small boat ride on the Yamuna river when Taj was closed (meaning: no tourists).
We met a very nice gentleman who was staying in the same hotel and had some great conversations - to say the truth, that made the highlight of the day. 😊
Perhaps it's because I'm writing this after some other more memorable events (Varanasi, hospital stays in Chennai), but Agra fades in my memory. Although very clean (they were expecting the visit of President Obama who never showed up), there isn't that much to see once you visit the major tourist places.
But Taj Mahal itself - it's incredible. Crowded beyond belief, there are few more touristy places in India, but still - it's a jewel.
I'm sure there is more to see in Agra - but for us, somehow it worked out to be only this. Perhaps next time?

The wake up call came at 0345 and I was up and about getting ready. I think I've gone beyond tired now, as I had no problem getting out of bed, I don't know how I'm functioning, on approx 9 hours sleep in 3 days.

In reception at 0430, everyone was looking weary and feeling drained, especially Keiran the Ozzie girl who had the worst hangover (I'm glad I went to bed when I did) Shakira slept though her wake up call and was a bit late and also feeling worse for wear. I didn't think she was drinking but apparently she'd polished off the gin vodka and whiskey-it seems chica has the breaking strain of a kitkat.

I'd said to Molly Brown this morning that the room sharing wasn't really working too well, and would she think about maybe going halves so we could both have a single room? I said I'd been unable to sleep and couldn't even catch up in the afternoons as she'd been sleeping then also. I know she can't help it but I also didn't like having to wake her all the time either then neither of us gets a good sleep. I
image
knew it wasn't ideal as it was more money we hadn't budgeted on spending, but could she maybe think about it for when we got to Nepal? She seemed to snap at me 'I've not budgeted for this either! I'm on a pension!'

I said I appreciate that but I'm just trying to think of a resolution that would work and was fair for the both of us, but at least think about it and let me know. I was trying to come up with something that was fair and would work for both of us, but I stand by my thinking that I had on day 1 (even more so now) that she is a deliberate pain in the ass in order to end up with a room to herself without the extra cost. She just seems like that sort of person. Then to play the pension card........



Anyway, back to stupid o clock and we got a tuk tuk to the train station-a different one from the one we arrived at. I couldn't believe how many people were up and about before 5am, it was so busy, and there seemed to be a lot
image
more trucks on the road. In fairness the roads were so congested in the day that maybe the nighttime is the only time they can get anywhere. It seems their road awareness was just as bad though when one reversed onto our side of the road and into our oncoming path. The tuk tuk swerved just in time, and all I could think was 'it's not even 5am'



Our train was already on the platform so we made our way through the rows of sleeping bodies and boarded. I had a window seat, so donned my earphones and eyemask, stuck my mozzie hat on put my pillow by the window and tried to sleep.

After 6 and a half hours (and with only a delay of 1 hour) we arrived in Gorakhpur which was a really busy busking station. We waited whilst some people went to use the loo, and with that the usual random crowd of men gathered to stare. One man even laid right down next to where Keiran was sitting and just stared at her. Lloyd gestured for him to move on and luckily he did. (Although with Harry and Lloyd being South
image
African, they are by default quite tall men so I guessed most people would do what they say!) Raghu had told us this town was full of crime and wasn't a nice part of India-we needed to get across the border before dark as it wasn't really a safe place to be.



So off the train and straight onto a bus for another 3 or so hours. It was really hot and quite cramped today, but still I tried closed my eyes and drifted in and out of a light sleep. Halfway into the journey we stopped for lunch at a place called Sushams Haveli hotel and restaurant.

Raghu told us it was best to pick something vegetarian as it would be quicker to cook, and also baca use he didn't know how fresh the meat was. I ordered a vegetable biriyani and a naan bread and took my malaria tablets before I forgot. You're meant to take them with food and as this was the first time we'd stopped all day, I thought I may as well whilst I remembered.



Back on the bus, we reached the border at Marharajganj where our
image
bags were taken across by cycle rickshaw and we went on foot via the visa office. The place was stinking and again there was litter and honking horns everywhere. I was becoming increasingly happier to be leaving india . I just hoped things weren't too similar over the border.



We handed our passports to the Indian office for stamping and was told to wait outside. After what seemed like forever, sitting in the sun listening to honking horns, we made our way across the border into Belehiya Nepal, and straight into the visa office. We filled out the visa forms and paid $25USD For a tourist visa. They were being quite difficult with some people and weren't accepting any dollars that had the slightest tear in them. By now we had been travelling 12 hours and people's patience was wearing a bit thin. To explain how ridiculous it got, Mr Wong paid for his and his wife's visa totalling $50 with a $100 note. They gave him a $50 note in change, which Mr Wong then swapped with someone who's dollars had been refused. When they went to pay, the $50 note was also refused, despite it
image
coming from the visa people in the first place!

Shakira and Harry had an additional problem in that their passports hadn't been stamped at the Indian side so they had to go back over and re ask to be stamped out of India. What a faff about!

Luckily there were no problems with my visa or dollars, and eventually when we were all sorted, we boarded the bus in Nepal for 1 more hour to reach the hotel.

Already Nepal was seemingly calmer, cleaner and quieter-just what was needed after a week of insane india!

We were meant to be going to Lumbini today, but given the train delay and problems at the border, it was starting to get dark so we decided we'd go tomorrow instead.

We reached the hotel which was a welcoming sight for most. It was lovely, and so clean! There was even a gym and swimming pool but unfortunately both were closed for the night. (I think I was too tired to use either anyway)

We were allocated our rooms and Molly Brown had made no reference to our conversation this morning so seeing as we'd be sharing again, I had to make this work for me somehow. I picked the bed on the side opposite to what she slept so I didn't have a direct snore in my direction and left her to it as I met the others in the restaurant for food.

I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered light bites of veggie spring rolls and chicken tikka, both of which were very tasty. As they accept Indian rupees here and I still had a few notes left, I paid using these and headed off to bed.

Chris the guy from Belgium kindly offered the spare bed in his room should the snoring get too much. He hadn't paid a single supplement either but had had a room to himself because of how the numbers worked out. I thanked him and seeing as he was only next door, could be an option, but still, not really one I wanted to take.

I chatted to lloyd who asked me how I was managing sharing with Molly Brown. I said not so good and he replied he didn't know how I did it as her mouth doesn't have an off button. This made me laugh and I was glad I wasn't the only one thinking similar thoughts. I didn't know if it was because of the sleep thing she was annoying me, but lloyd said that everyone was getting tired of hearing her voice.

Back in the room I had a lovely hot shower whilst Molly was sewing her trousers flicking through the tv channels. She'd left it on some old film that was either in Nepalese or Hindi, and as I got into bed I asked if she'd mind turning it off. Eye mask on, ear plugs in, I said good night and started to drift off to sleep. After about half an hour I heard the familiar rumble and shouted 'Pearl!' No way was she disturbing me tonight, I needed to get to sleep before her snorting began.



I was so glad to be in Nepal, a week in India had been enough for me. Such poverty with such riches, suppression of women and a past female prime minister, a holy place being the one with the most filth, unacceptable to eat a cow, yet figures suggest a woman is raped every 20 minutes, to which no one bats an eyelid. Cover your knees and shoulders as it is offensive yet bare your midriff in a sari. There were too many contradictions for me, and it seemed like a place of all or nothing. Unfortunately many have nothing. Will india ever change? Does it need to? Yes and no in some ways, but even if it was just a reduction in litter and pollution, I think it would be a totally different place, and one for the better. It's almost laughable that we have a congestion charge within a few miles radius of central London, when you come to places like this with cities such as Delhi, Jaipur, and Varanasi which probably belch out a thousand per cent more pollution in 1 day than London does in a year.

I thought about my Nanna back in the 1930s, and completely got why she'd had enough and wanted to return home. Of course India would have been very different back then, but to bring 2 children up in this alien environment must have been incredibly difficult. 1 week was enough for me, let alone the several years she'd lived here, even giving birth to my Grandma-the sanitation wasn't up to much now so I dread to think what is was like then. It was great to experience the culture and see the sights like Agra fort and of course the Taj Mahal, but the incessant traffic, and over crowding, the noise and the filth, the spitting, I had seen all I needed to see, and was looking forward to what Nepal had to offer.

Raj Ghat
A crazy one-week trip to India: traveller's diary



(1) Sonday: Lotus Temple (of Bahai), Humayun's Tomb, Lodhi Garden

(2) Monday: Minarette, New Delhi Central Station, Old Delhi Market at night

(3) Tuesday: Red Ford (outside), Raj Ghat, Indian Gate, Sikh Temple

(4) Wednesday: 2nd time Lotus Temple, New Delhi Market, Akshadam Temple

(5) Thursday: Agra (Taj Mahal), Bus to Mathura

(6) Friday: Holy Festival in Mathura (birthplace of Krishna)&Garravkendra, trip back to Delhi

(7) Saturday: New Delhi Street Market, Flight back



(1) Just one hour after my arrival, I met some nice Australian and British girls and we first went to the Lotus Temple by a tuktuk and experienced the caotic and very noisy traffic and saw lots of almost-accidents. The traveller's discriptions that I found online previously are true: the bigger and louder one on the street wins. After bargaining with the tuktuk driver, we payed 120 Rupies for the way from South Delhi to the Lotus Temple, South-East Delhi.
When I walked through the garden, I felt the positiveness, spirit and purity of that place. Inside, I felt the freedom that I shared with people from every
Humayun's Tomb
religion around the world, such as from Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc. Bahai is a very impressive religion, which content is composed of the pure and uniting belief as itself. After Lotus, we visited the Humayun's Tomb, a smaller Taj Mahal, and the Lodhi garden, a park, in that I could end the first day well.



(2) The Minarette is a high tower in the middle of a park where many other monuments from the time of islamic occupation remain. It is a nice place for a walk through the sunshine. After that, another German who I met and I went to New Delhi Central Station in order to buy a train ticket to Agra on Thursday. At the parking lot, a well english-speaking Indian man told us that we were not allowed to go strait to the station, but rather to buy a ticket at a ""Tourist Office"" - Bullshit! This office (DTTDC) wants you to buy a privat drive to Agra for 16.000 Rb. We went back to the Central Station by a Ricksha which dropped us right in front of the intrance. The central station really is an experience for Europeans: the locals at the
Akshadam temple
counter line stand VERY close to each other and are continuously pushing themselves. So we had to push ourselves as well if we wanted to buy a ticket before midnight. Probably, many counters tell you that you have to go to the next counter. Don't hesitate, we asked the police about a tourist counter and after an about 1 hour search, we finally found it and got 2 tickets for just 900 Rb. I needed a bathroom and just found a poop hole at the publc washroom. Better don't wash your hands after! We just walked around, followed the crowd that left the central station and accidently found the old Delhi market at night. It is a beautiful, chaotic but save place, which is rather visited by locals. There, we could buy bracelets, spice and food from the people who sell it on the street- but the rule is: only go where many buy food and we didn't get any issues. But I've never bought ice, ice cream or anything that contains milk (it's just creamer in the -they have only coffeinfree 😞 - coffee). There, we were looking for beer or alcohol in general but the sale is only
Old Delhi market at night
allowed in few licor stores. However, I saw goats that were standing and eating at the shop. After an about 2 miles walk (we left by a sideway because it's very widespread), we took the metro and got a beer at a restaurant (It's about 350 Rb. for a Heineken).



(3) Red Fort is a very big building but the counter area was crowded and the counter line very long. So we went to the Raj Ghat, a peaceful park with a Ghandi monument, and to the Indian Gate. The Sikh Temple that we visited after, was impressive and looks like 1001 nights. The Sikhs welcome everyone from every religion (even people without any).



(4) I went with 3 other Europeans to the Lotus Temple for the 2nd time and gained more information about the Bahai. I became more fascinated by the peaceful openness towards every religion. After, we went to the Delhi market which is a modern street market. The Akshadam temple is an impressively big Hindu temple but very commercial! It is possible to buy tickets for a water show and to eat at an american-style food court. I am impressed by
Indian Gate
the diversity of religions in Delhi, that I learned by now, especially because India is famous for its conservativeness. Additionally, an Indian told me that the ""untouchables"" are most probably implemented by the Brits (not implemented in Hinduism, therefore is it not a religious component) and rather a spiritual and social matter, than a legal. Consequently, the people are treated as untouchable and not seriously seen as untouchable. But there is a huge difference between (modern and by the west effected) city of Delhi and the smaller town/villages- that's what I experienced the next 2 days.



(5) The other (male) German and I took the train to Agra and arrived at about 3 pm. We sat at a sleeping compartement which was more comfortable than expected. We arrived at Taj Mahal through the small center by a tuktuk and it looks Mediterranean and I saw cows on the street for the first time- and they are seriously not touched by human! Taj Mahal is huge and impressive but honestly not as breathtaking as I expected. The sunset was close and we went to a bus station that was labelled on the city map, but the counter employees
Sikh Temple
told us that there is no bus leaving anymore, neither today, nor tomorrow. We thought that it was not a far walk to the tourist office and walked through the darkness. We realized that we were in the poverty area or even in the slum (we passed a huge trash spot) and an old man pushed me. I got terrified and he looked at me scary but I just moved on, hoping that he wouldn't make any trouble. The people started the holi festival, got drunk and harassing. Some guys just shouted harassing things. I didn't feel save and we took a tuktuk to the city center. There, a police officer told the driver were the office and the right station exactly are. The office was closed and the driver brought us to the ""right"" bus station which was exactly the one before where everyone told us that there was no bus leaving anymore! Suddenly, there was the last bus to Mathura, the birth place of Krishna. We first asked 3 Indians in the bus if this is the bus to Mathura and they shaked their heads. Second, we asked if it's the one to Delhi- they nodded. Then we
Taj Mahal
asked if it stopps in Mathura- they nodded. All right. Arrived in Mathura, we didn't feel save. The men were drunk and bothering. But there were some officers and one of them guided us to a hotel. Later, I gained the information that most Indians additionally get high during holi by Haschisch tea. The next day was horrible!



(6) We left the hotel at 10 am and immidiately met some children that roughly smeared color and color water everywhere at us (eyes, ears, nose and mouth). It wasn't funny for us. The Indian men were staring at me although I covered my head with a scarf. Even one Indian told me that I am a ""problem"" and should stay in a room (and that he can offer a room for 500 Rb.). I was often surrounded by 5-6 guys and who touched or embraced my very tightly. We met 3 Americans who asked us if we wanted to join them to go to another place were a party is going on. It took about 20 minutes to the village Garravkendra, outside Mathura, where no police was. I was surrounded by men groups all the time and I
Old Delhi (close to Red Fort)
even got my breast pinched. Later I realized that it was the holi party place for the locals who went to from even smaller villages and probably have never seen a white woman before. Additionally, I was the only jounger woman in that group. The high and drunk men were seriously freaking out and a crowd of 30 or more appeared around me, embracing and touchung me like fresh food. I've even heard one Indian saying ""I want to fuck her"". I shouted and the American and German guys shouted at them and guided me through. The American women clung my back and we went back to Mathura. At the tuktuk, I was close of crying because we couldn't leave that whole rural area immidiately and I was really scared of rape. We went to the train station (we didn't walk again in that area because guys were always stopping and harassing). We met a white couple at the train station who felt similarly. Again, we had to go from counter to counterand, pushing and shouting for 2 tickets. After I finally received it, I wanted to cancel my original return ticket for the evening, but the guy was just
Old Delhi
counting his money at the other side of the counter glass without answering my polite inquiry. When I started to ask louder, another man told me after a while that it is lunch time. We took a very deep breath and went to the platform. I felt better at the train and I got back my self-confidence towards the men who were looking at us. At the horrible village, I tried to make myself as small and invisible as possible.

Back in Delhi, I somehow felt like home and save at first. But my friend has to drop off the tuktuk at a Delhi Bus station because we went to Jaipur and I had to go to the accomodation by my own in that tuktuk (after 9pm). Previously, when we were bargaining with the driver, a guy joined us and annoyingly asked us where we wanted to go, as usual in India. We ignored him but he wispered, refering to the Hindi-speaking drivers, ""don't belief a word, seriously"" and left. When my friend dropped off, I told him loudly in english that I'll give him a call after my arrival. I was still paraniod, wrapped my scarf around my head and held my pepperspray in one hand and my selfphone in the other. Thankfully, I arrived save. American girls told me that they have badly been harassed in the metro. On my trip, I learned about Indian women's feeling (or a woman in that place) who can't feel save on the streets. Usually, I am a freedom embracing woman but due to that experience I would never go out in Dehli and in India in general after sunset by my own.

Now I konow how it feels to be a not respectfully and not equally (down to the physics) treated human being or even to loose my human status because of my sex and, as a consequence, to be seen as a piece of flesh. I experienced a different way of comprehension of human being that includes social status which in turn contains equality and respect towars the relative interpretation of human being that effects the physical equality (distinction) which is finally expressed by harassment and suppression of females.

Even more I experienced the necessity of adaption of behavoir to that cultural conditions. Concerning that, one social male-female behavior became omnipresent to me: at the bus to Mathura, there were 2 Indian couples, very polite and we started a conversation. They invited us to join them to a guest house. Sadly, only Indians were allowed to stay and they gave us the address of the hotel. In that guest house, I had to ask for a restroom. So, the employee went upstairs with one of the Indian men and after a few seconds, he called his Indian wife to come upstairs and she guided me the way upstairs to the toilet. I think this is an example of conservative male-femal behavoir: the husband checks (for protection) wether there really is a toilet and then, foreign girls are guided by local girls. I understand that women are forced to behave that way because they need physical protection in that area. I would never have imagined that I would never go to the Himalaya (I had thought about it several days before) without at leat one man who is constantly with me. I feel restricted in doing things in that conservative country, I lost my social status among Indian men because of my sex and I had to adapt in order to return save.



(7) After an uneasy night, I went to the Rawij Chowk New Delhi Street Market at noon and met a British girl. She studies social sciences at Delhi University and is writing her thesis on the effect of sexual differences and treatment in Indian society on women's usage of sustainable public transport. She told me that the campus is strictly seperated into boys and girls areas and that most girls, especially from smaller Indian towns, never leave the campus. It was interesting to me how normally white girls, who not even know each other, can stick together and experience things similarly due to their common western backround.

I left Delhi at night and caught myself in pushing me through the check-in airport counter roughly in the way that I have learned in Delhi. Back to Europe, I feel the first wave of a kind of reverse culture shock. The weather is different (cold) but familiar and calmative, too. Everything works straightly, planned and totally unchaotic, as known. Home sweet home.

Ganges sunrise
After the lack of sleep on the night train I was so tired I didn't think I'd have trouble sleeping. Turns out that a full afternoon of snoozing for Molly brown wasn't enough and she snored the whole night. I was sick of her by now so woke her up every time she started. Just as I was managing to drift off she'd start again, damn it, if only I could drop off first!!



My alarm went off at 0430 to which she groaned and didn't move. I showered and made my way downstairs for 0500 the time I thought we were meeting. Turns it it wasn't until 0530 but it allowed me time to have a couple of coffees before heading out.

We got a tuk tuk to the same place on the river Ganges as we'd been last night. It was a lot quieter this morning but was still very busy nevertheless. As we approached the river, I could see many people washing. Raghu had asked us if anyone wanted to use this time to go into the Ganges, and seemed surprised when nobody took him up on the offer. He said that out of
image
a group, he always had at least 4 or 5 people going into the Ganges. (My question was how many came back out?!) he said it was a once in a lifetime thing to experience a dip in the sacred river Ganges. I thought this was probably because that one dip would probably involve contracting some hideous infection that would effectively end your lifetime, so for me it was still a no thank you very much!



On the boat we sailed towards the burning ghats that we'd seen last night. There were still bodies lined up on the steps awaiting cremation. on the way back bobbing along the the stern of a couple of Boats were 2 triangular things protruding out of the water, as I looked slightly right of that I saw the triangular things were attached to something else-a torso and it was in fact the bent knees forming the triangles. I looked at Chanelle and she looked at me, we both looked back into the water and then at each other- is that....? Yes I think so.....

Raghu had said he had only ever seen about 5 bodies in his time coming here.
image
A little later on saw a big white thing that was also probably a bloated body that had surfaced, and tripled in size.

It felt a bit eerie, in fact I didn't know how to feel. It was almost strange accepting this is a part of the Ganges traditions, because if I was back home in a boat across the river Humber and saw a body floating by I think my heart would be in my mouth, but because it's expected here it didn't seem as shocking as I thought it would be. In fact what I found more shocking was that Literally meters away people were bathing and splashing the river water onto their face like an Indian Oil of Olay advert. I wouldn't dip a toe in there, not even if you paid me.



As we sailed and saw more people bathing, and men washing clothes on the banks of the river, the sun started to rise, and despite all the filth and death, those first Rays of the morning sun glistened on the water and it actually looked like a beautiful serene place. We got some lovely pictures and I was glad to
image
have experienced the two different sides of the day on the River Ganges.



We made our way through some narrow streets, and passed more mangey dogs.there seemed to a lot more dogs here that all seemed quite content sleeping amongst piles of rubbish. I thought of Bridgend Dogs Trust where I volunteer as a dog walker, and couldn't even imagine where you'd begin in rounding up all the dogs here for a similar vaccination and neutering programme. Even those homeless dogs in South Wales were a million times more lucky than their flea ridden Indian friends here. I hated seeing homeless people and begging. I especially hated seeing children with palms outstretched, and them motioning eating food. I thought of my own nieces and nephews at home who despite their best efforts, always had clean faces for bedtime, and someone to tuck them into a comfy bed and read them a story after a day of playing. What a completely different world these children were born into here, and non of them would ever know of Peppa pig.



We went to a cafe for breakfast where I had an omelette and hash brown with
image
a cup of earl grey tea. The food was lovely but it took ages and quite a lot of people's orders were mixed up. I bought a nice hand painted card of the river Ganges and figured with the filth of the place it was the only 'souvenir' I wanted from Varanasi. If it was so sacred why was it so polluted? Why was there so much litter? Another massive contradiction I find with india. The most sacred holy place-yet the filthiest. We went back to the hotel and had an hour to kill before meeting up again. I didn't want to risk going to sleep so I got some wifi and sent some messages.

At 10am we got a tuk tuk for a tour of the silk factory. Apparently the best silk clothing is made in Varanasi, and everyone wanted to see how it was done. The 'factory' turned out to be a series of rooms in people's homes dotted around a lot of alley ways. The first one had a man hammering holes into a piece of card that was eventually used in the machine for the patterns. It was painstaking work but he was so efficient
image
and sat around bundles and bundles of cards. Next, across the road was a room that housed all the bobbins of silk, in so many different colours. The man explained that silk was bought by the kilo from northern India and costs depended to the quality of silk, after that we weaved our way in and out of the winding alleyways (which by the way we're still full of goats, Children, men staring and mopeds) we saw the loom at work weaving all the silk into a garment. It reminded me of a history lesson from school, learning all about the industrial revolution where machines such as The Mule, and Spinning Jenny were invented, only one it looked like they were right I front of my eyes.

In the next house (and when I say house they are actually more like a garage, in size and decor) a man sat in the dark, hand weaving a sari which can take anywhere up to 1-4 months. The reason he was working in the dark was due to a power cut so he used the tiny bit of sunlight that came in through the shutters.

There were lots of children
image
playing in the alley and gradually as they saw us standing there, the numbers increased. They were all filthy but smiling and laughing and wanting us to take their picture. Before heading to the 'shop' where you could by the silk, we stopped by 2 more houses where people were hand stitching jewels onto the woven silk. It really was beautiful and very skilled intricate work.

At the shop, we were invited to remove our shoes and go upstairs where we would be shown lots of different silks. The man was really nice and explained to us the difference in quality of the silks, and how long it took to make each one. He said it was a family business which had been making saris for 3 generations. They shipped all over the world and could even arrange shipping of any items we bought today. He offered us tea and it was actually a nice relaxed environment with plenty of time to look and appreciate the product with no hard sell.

He showed us, bedspreads, table cloths, table runners, silk scarves, pashminas, and finally saris. It was all so beautiful but the cheapest scarves were about £30 admittedly

still cheaper than back in the UK for the quality of them, but figured I'd be buying for buyings sake.

He did show us some scarves made from a cheaper silk which was more our price so we bought some of those as gifts as they were just as nice.

I would have loved to have bought a sari. They were beautiful and so colourful. The man even said he could tailor make the tops and drop them off at the hotel later-what's service. But they were about £45 and I figured I've reached 32 without ever needing to wear a sari, so again, pointless buying for buyings sake. A couple of the girls were measured up though and looked lovely in their new silks. The bedding and table clothes started at about £60 up to about £600, and after seeing how much effort went into making them, I'd say that price is justified-it really was good quality. If I had come to India without being part of a group (which I highly doubt I would have done) I would have had no idea where to find these places or how to go about seeing them, so this
Good morning!
was just one of the many reasons I was glad to be a part of an organised trip.

We thanked the man and some people wanted to stay in Varanasi and have a look in the shopping mall. I wasn't too fussed for this but thought I'd go to see if I could find a cheaper sari, or one that I could bring back for Isabelle. We had food in the mall, and my stomach felt a little bit crampy. I was so pleased that up until now I had managed to survive india without the dreaded Delhi belly, but maybe I was getting a case of VaranASSi......?

The shopping mall consisted of around 3 floors of 5 shops, all mostly clothes shop for men, 2 sports shops and eating places. I had a wonder around with Chanelle, the Aussie bird who had survived the trip so far with no luggage. She too had flown Malaysian airlines but her bags had gotten lost when apparently there had been a baggage strike somewhere between Australia and India. We were in jaipur when she found out her bags were actually in Delhi but were being held by customs, and she
image
would have to physically go there in person to collect them (all at her own cost) since we weren't heading back to Delhi she'd decided to just go without and collect her bags on her way back to Australia. I'd like to think she'd bought some clean underwear since Delhi, but she seemed happy to cut about in the same trousers and was more upset that her better camera lens was in her bag, especially now that her original lens had been ruined by taking pictures of Holi.



We stopped by a camera shop and asked if they had Nikon lenses. He said not, but after a bit of good old Google, wrote the directions down for somewhere that might. Not wanting to trapse around crazy Varanasi to buy a camera lens, I headed back to the mall where we had agreed to meet at 3pm. I found a shop selling saris that were much cheaper (about £25) and tried to find ones to fit. Unfortunately the only sizes that had were medium. XL, and XXL. I asked if they had any smaller as the medium were still quite big, but the man told me 'no, in
Too early?!
India women are fat' if there had been one that I liked that fitted better I really would have been tempted to get one, but I reckoned I could probably pick one up in Aldershot for the same price given that there is a huge Nepalese population in the town, but it was fun trying them on all the same.



We got a tuk tuk back to the hotel where I was looking forward to having an afternoon snooze. No such luck. Molly had beaten me to it and was laid snoring away. I decided I wasn't even going to try so I started packing instead. I didn't go out of my way to be noisy but all the same, no longer would I be going out of my way to keep quiet-I decided to take a leaf from Molly Brown and do what I would be doing if I had a room to myself, and sod anyone else. I had a shower and I wasn't best pleased when I noticed she hadn't cleaned the toilet and used my facecloth that was on top of my wash bag, so I didn't feel even slightly guilty using the
image
hairdryer to dry my hair. That seemed to wake her and after moaning about her cold for about ten minutes she said she was getting up. Great, I thought, so I got into bed. I had my eye mask and earplugs in but she still insisted on talking to me. I ignored her and a miracle happened-I fell asleep!

The damned phone woke me up an hour later. It was Shakira asking if I was coming to dinner. I told her to go ahead without me. I really wanted to stay in bed but thought I should eat as we were having such a long day tomorrow, and I would be hungry. It was 6pm so thought I'd go eat in the hotel restaurant. As I was walking down the corridor I heard Sue and Chanelle so thought I'd stick my head around to see if they fancied coming for food.



Chanelle had been on the vodka and cokes since late afternoon and was starting to get a bit tipsy. They said that they were ordering room service and as no one had gone out for dinner in the end, they had invited everyone into their
image
room to share the booze.

I thought I'd just get some food then try to head back to bed. I ordered the noodles I'd had yesterday seeing as they were so nice. I wasn't too bothered for drinking but figured a cheeky vodka might aid a good sleep. Keiran got out her selfie stick and started taking loads of photos, which led to Chanelle whipping out her new camera lens and proudly showing it off to everyone. Considering she'd gone for so long without her own clothes and toiletries, I would of thought that would have been a more exciting thing to buy, but no, the camera lens was her new toy and she said she was sending her old one into the river Ganges to bid it farewell!

I headed off to bed a little before 10. We weren't going to get much sleep as it was, but thought I'd at least try. I don't know why I bothered, as the snorting pig was her usual self. I text Daryl and congratulated him on his exam results, he'd messaged earlier to say they were in. I also had a message from Sam empathising my night train pain
Reminds me of grandad Fred x
and saying she missed me too. How I loved hearing from those back home, it really made me smile.

I'd downloaded a film earlier thinking at least I could nod off watching that. I ended up watching it all and then laid reading for a bit. I finally got to sleep 2 hours before we needed to be up again. At least my stomach seemed ok-would I really make it out of India with no upset stomach?

Time to leave once again for jahansi, and yet again another crazy ride to the train station. Sue once again sat in the front but thankfully this time there was a working seatbelt. As it was by now 8pm and dark, we made a new discovery-that everyone not only drives like madmen, but they do so with full beams on. We stopped at a little shop on the way and I was in dispair when the driver did what looked to be a U turn, and instead of going back on himself on the opposite side of the road, chose to reverse that part instead to pull up outside of the shop-all with oncoming traffic beeping us out of the way. By now I actually didn't feel worried, it's almost like I've accepted the driving and nothing else can surprise me.



At the station we piled into the waiting room for an hour or so, our train was due to arrive at 22.30, although again we had been warned delays were quite common. We were lucky, the train was only 5 minutes late, other wise it would have meant a long stay in that waiting room. The train
image
station was as hectic as everywhere else with people sleeping everywhere, begging everywhere, manged dogs scratching everywhere, rats everywhere, and the thing I found the most bizarre: men just came and stood next to you and stared. Then another would join the another and another until there were about 6-7 men or boys just stood staring. Raghu said they were intrigued by us, but it was very odd. To grow up in a society that says it's rude to stare, is again another polar opposite from this place. I said to Lesley one of the Aussie women, I wonder if you had a stare off, who'd look away first?! I tried it and couldn't last longer than 3 seconds, it was so uncomfortable. I'd definitely feel quite threatened if I wasn't travelling in a group such as this, they were almost crowding around us. It's not often I feel this uncomfortable when travelling and even though I knew we'd be safe because we had Raghu with us, it was all still a little bit freaky.



Another thing that is a bit hard to get used to is the spitting. Men just spit anywhere and everywhere, mainly to
Yay only a tad late!
get rid of the chewing tobacco so commonly used here, and you'll find bright orange splats all over the pavements. Quite disgusting.



On the train we found our bunks, now if you can imagine walking down the carriage, to the left were 6 bunks but facing each other in 3 tiers. To the right were 2 bunks an upper and a lower facing the aisle. I was in bunk 2 on the left being the middle bunk. Chris from Belgium was in the top bunk and Mrs Wong from Canada was below me. Opposite her on the bottom was Mr Wong and the two above them were two older Indian men.

We made up our beds and the blankets and sheets, looked and smelled clean, but I used my sleeping bag liner just in case. I wasn't anticipating a good nights sleep as we were right by the door and Varanasi was the 26th and last stop on this 12 hour journey. Another thing that I wasn't expecting was the lack of curtains. I thought we'd have something to draw across for privacy but there was nothing except a sweaty man less than a meter away
Our 'audience' behind
from me occasionally glancing over. It was going to be a long night.



Raghu had told us not to leave our bags unattended at all on the train, as so many people were coming and going. We all put our big bags under Mr and Mrs Wongs lower bunks and I joked with them they could stag on first but they hadn't a clue what I was on about so told them they were bag sentries instead. They laughed and then rolled over to sleep. I put my rucksack as a bit of a pillow. This meant that my head was a bit further down the bed and I couldn't extend my feet without the door catching on them when someone walked through, so I tucked them in and tried to get comfortable.



Raghu came to check we were all ok and turned the light out, only 5 minutes later it was turned on again. Raghu came back down again a bit later on and turned it off again. Like my mum turning on the big light in the bedroom to get me up for school-boom it was back on. The ticket inspector sat
So busy
on the right hand side lower bunk going through his paperwork, and I didn't really want to say anything, So got out my iPad and started typing some of the blog.



I put my iPod on to drown out the ticket inspector chatting with his mate that had joined him and manic street preachers came on. I instantly thought of Wales and wondered what Daryl was doing right now. I felt a bit sad so shuffled the music on. The next song was one that reminded me of Army Rugby and what the boys used to blare out whilst getting ready for the game. I thought of Daryls pep talks in the changing room where he'd make everyone close their eyes and visualise the game, (and probably the only time I've heard him use the f word when it comes to rugby and winning) I wished I could smell deep heat now instead of the dank heavy waft I get getting on the train (it must be bad if I wished I was smelling a men's rugby changing room) and then I got to thinking how I used sneak a peak at Daryl when I was supposed
In my bunk for the night
to be visualising (and never knew why I did this as I wasn't playing rugby) giving it his whole 9 yards speech, and I'd think 'I quite fancy him.' I never thought 3 and a half years later I'd be on a train in the middle of India missing him so much. I knew india wasn't really his thing and after being here a few days, it reinforced my thinking that it wasn't the place for him. This made it easier in a way, as I wasn't constantly thinking 'Daryl would love this' or 'I'm so gutted Daryl is missing this' apart from the Taj Mahal visit, I don't think he'd care for the place, and one of the reasons I didn't feel so bad about coming alone as it was never a place we'd enthused about together. I looked forward to our upcoming holiday in April. Together we've been to some amazing places, America, Mexico, New Zealand, Hawaii, Tenby.... thinking of him, I'm not ashamed to say I actually had a little cry. I like to say this was more at the thought that he was laid at home diagonally in our memory foam bed with a V pillow
The better experience of a night train with Delia
and a slanket with a cup of tea, and I was laid looking up at someone's hairy feet, but I'd be lying, (I really am missing you DSJ) but he wasn't the only person I was missing right now.



4 years ago whilst backpacking Thailand I shared my first night train with one of my best friends Sam (who I always call Delia as its her middle name) we had such a blast. We ate a KFC at the station before boarding even though it was only day 3 and we'd sworn to go the whole holiday without doing fast food. We were so hungover though I think we'd of eaten our feet if we could, we were so hungry. That train was only 2 tiers tho and a lot more space than this. It even had a karaoke carriage and even with its naff paper doilies and tinsel decoration, we had a great night on that train, drinking bear and dancing, and even top and tailed like we were kids choosing instead to use one bunk for our bags and one for us two giggling idiots. We had one of those long giggling fits where you
Missing my DSJ & Delia
can't stop and in the end forget what you're even laughing at. It was a great memory and I so wished she was here with me. I pulled out the photos of us two that were slipped behind my iPad in the holder, and looked at our smiley faces from the top of a sunny Bavarian mountain. I missed Delia. We've had some cracking times together, and a foreign night train without her was just no fun. I was glad she was coming to South America in May, and imagined the next set of travel memories we'd make.

So without my man (or my delia ) to cwtch up with I turned to face the wall and tried to sleep. I had my headphone in and eye mask on but could still hear the chatting and the light was so bright it kept sneaking in somehow. I heard something over my earphones like a bleeping and this went on for the next half an hour. I was sure it was the mans alarm clock opposite me, but couldn't be sure. By now there were 5 men chatting with the ticket inspector and one was even sitting on the end
image
of poor Mr Wongs bed. I looked down at them and in turn they just glared up at me and continued their conversation.



I text Daryl earlier and so I switched my phone on to see if I had a reply. I don't know what I pressed but up came a history of multi media messages we'd sent (no wonder my phone was always saying full) I scrolled right back to the beginning and watched a video of Isabelle snorting at peppa pig when she was little, and playing on the swing in the back garden. Reuben cradling his new baby brother Caleb and me and isabelle cuddling up to Charlie for the first time. Various pictures of food envy we send each other including a big pot of my Mams stew and dumplings, and pictures of Jans Royal wedding party up the caravan. Pictures of me sweating to prove to Daryl I had actually done phys, pictures of me sleeping after I'd done phys. Pictures of Reuben sleeping over, and ones of me on my promotion course. Pictures of us dressed as bat man and robin and pictures of nights out, laughing smiling, living. I felt
image
like I didn't recognise that person in those pictures, it seemed like a lifetime ago we were laughing. When did it stop? It was around December 2012 when the big question mark was put over my head regarding my job, and until redundancy was confirmed in June 2014 that question mark only served to get heavier and heavier. I'd had 3 different jobs in this time including the one I loved in Aldershot, but had to leave as it got cut. I'd moved to Wales and never really settled, I felt like I'd lost touch with friends being so out in the sticks, and somewhere in these 2 and a bit years I think I've lost lot of myself along the way.



In the last 10 years I've travelled a bit and wanted to seek out adventure, sun, and culture. I'd wanted to take a career break at one point but it wasn't really feasible so just settled for making the most of leave periods instead. India and South America were the 2 big ones on my list that remained unticked, so with the leave I had left to take before my time in the RAF was
Chris on top bunk
over, I'd always planned to take these trips. Now I was doing it, and actually here, it seemed easier to look at that person I'd left back home. The one who'd stopped getting dressed up and going out, the one who'd become teary and irritable at everything and everyone, and the one who had buckled under the weight of that question mark as it had gotten heavier over these two years. The one I no longer wanted to be but as it had become a normality, one I didn't know how get back.



I don't want it to sound dramatic or like I had an epiphany or anything like that, but sometimes being forced into just sitting and being and doing nothing forces you to think of things you wouldn't otherwise have been thinking. It didn't come as news to me that I'd been feeling this way for so long, but by taking this trip and being away and doing the thing I'd had in my head for so long, marked the end of something. With that it also marked the start of something, and as the song goes, every new beginning comes from some other beginnings
Bloody big light!
end. I resolved to find that person who was still there somewhere, and bring a little part of her home for starters. I looked at the fat man snoring about a meter away from me, and physically felt this one of the less nicer places I'd been. Mentally though it was a good place to be in, and I think it was a long time coming. I think I needed this stinking train time to remind me of the things that had somehow gotten buried and lost. I didn't think I'd find them all on the route to Varanasi. it was however a good start, and in a way I felt glad I wasn't tucked up in a comfy bed somewhere, as I'd have had to wait a bit longer for something else to remind me of the next new and exciting chapter of my life that would be beginning in a matter of weeks.



Eventually the man woke up and turned his alarm off, but by now I was bursting for a pee. I deliberated weather or not to hold on or risk leaving my bags and chance what would probably be a honking smelly toilet. The man opposite got out of bed and was gone for a few minutes before collecting his belongings and getting off at the next stop.

I put my bags under my blanket and made a dash for the loo-by now it was 3am. We'd been on the train 4 and a half hours and I knew my bladder couldn't last another 7 hours. The toilet actually wasn't too bad although I wiped the seat and hovered rather than sit. I held onto a sink for a bit of support and my bum was treated by a blast of air. I looked down to see the tracks passing beneath me, but at least it was a good way not to make the toilet cubicles smell so much.



I made my way back to my bunk and thought enough was enough. I looked at the ticket inspector and his buddies, pointed at the light and made a cutting action across my throat. He nodded and flicked the switch. I don't know how long I'd been dozing for but the chat got even louder and the light was back on and without thinking I swung around and whipped my eye mask off. My haggard tired face must have scared the hell out of them as before I even spoke one of them said 'sorry ma'am' and turned the light off again.



Only about 11 more stops to go.....

Varanasi



The train finally rolled into Varanasi at around 11pm. We walked across the road to the hotel which wasn't too far. Crossing the road was again an effort in itself, luckily Raghu is not also a tour guide but acts as lollipop man when required (which is much of the time!) the hotel was lovely, really clean. Raghu handed out the room keys, I figured I would sleep through anything tonight so wasn't too fussed about sharing with Molly brown. Raghu did say that I could have my own room for the rest of the trip for an extra £200 for the week.

I did think about it. On one hand I hated sharing with Molly, but on the other, I was a bit peed off that that was money for my Everest flight and other optional activities in Nepal. I decided to ride it out. Like I said I was so tired today, surely I would sleep through a war?! Molly was moaning she had a cold so I had a shower and freshened up and left her to it. I even had a face pack and took the nail varnish off my toes. Where
image
I'd sprayed DEET and later put my socks on, the socks had stuck to my toenails and all I was left with was black fluff-not a good look.

I headed down stairs to get something to eat from the hotel restaurant. There seemed to be a lot of Chinese guests, which must be a common thing as they also had really great Chinese menu. I was glad of a change from curry so I ordered chicken noodles and a cup of Reuben tea. It was so nice just to feel clean and relax and I was really looking forward to seeing the sunset tonight.

Later we all met in the lobby, and got a tuk tuk down to the Ganges. Varanasi was even busier (if that's possible) than anywhere we'd been so far. There were more cows and more motorbikes (a pair of cows were even locking horns in the middle of the road with vehicles swerving around them) it was the most insane place yet.

The tuk tuk dropped up off and we had to walk some of the way down to the river. We actually walked around a roundabout with more weaving and Raghu doing
image
his lollipop bit. I wasn't liking this much! There were people begging everywhere and I saw a man with no legs dragging himself along on his front on a bit of cardboard-his face literally was in the gutter. Again it was such a contrasting place-there were people like this and round the corner we'd just driven past a Tommy hillfiger shop advertising the latest fashion.



As we approached the river it was amazing to see such a bustling place. It was so crowded, and reminiscent of a farmyard with the amount of cows and dung everywhere. We got on the boat and initially sailed up river to see the place where all the nightly ceremony happens, and the Hindu priests will stand. Raghu explained about the significance of the Ganges in that it gives life to the popel of Varanasi but is also so sacred that people come here specifically to die. They leave all their worldly goods to their children or family and head to Varanasi to wait for God (I don't know which one as the Hindus have so many) we then turned around and headed towards the Ghats where the cremations took place. My
image
sister in law michelle had told me about these when she'd seen them in Nepal last year. This particular ghat on this part of the river was open all day except between the hours of 2-3am. Initially the bodies are raised and lowered into the river 5 times and then left to dry out before being cremated. The people who carried out the cremations were The lowest of the caste system. It was believed this group had done something bad in a previous life so now they were destined to do this work. I thought how awful this was, that from the moment of birth your destiny was written in that this job would be all that you would do in life. I wondered if any of them ever tried to get away, but with the illiteracy and poverty so prevalent, and their beliefs so strong, they probably never knew that other ways of life could exist for them.



On the sail back we had a candlelight ceremony, where you light a little candle amongst flowers and make a wish as you set if adrift in the river Ganges. Harry and Lloyd had bought a photo to
image
put with theirs which turned out to be of Lloyds father who had passed away. I lit my candle and wished for (now come on, as if I'd tell you! Everyone knows it won't come true if you tell)



I made my wish and let mine go, and turned back to see lloyd sitting with tears rolling down his face. I don't know why but I got up and walked over to give him a hug, and then turned to hug Harry sat opposite him who by now was also crying.

I sat back down and noticed Shakira who was sat next to me was also crying-it seemed everyone must have had the same emotional train journey as me, and it was just catching up with them. I gave her hand a squeeze and smiled.

I didn't think I'm a particularly spiritual person, but there was something of a feel about this place that made something in me feel a bit, well, I don't really know. It just seemed peaceful and without sounding like a complete moron, it felt like there was a lot of positive energy about the place.

We stopped the boat
image
to watch the nightly prayer service where 7 priests stood on the banks, ring bells and burning fires. There was a lot of oooooommmmmmmm going on. Shakira was still crying and thee wre kids jumping between boats trying to sell things. They couldn't have been much older than 7 or 8. Imagine our 7 year olds leaping between boats across a river??! Non of them fell in though. Good proprioception (that comment is for you DSJ ;-)



We had another emotional walk back to get a tuk tuk, Raghu was by now just grabbing the handles on the motorbike as they came towards us to make them stop, it was insane. We went to a nepalese restaurant where for the first time we saw steak on the menu. I was so tempted but it turned out to be water buffalo, so I had noodles instead.

Molly brown skipped food and went straight back to the hotel, so she was snorting like a pig by the time I'd got back in-urgh by now I was starting to think that ALL snorers should be put down (yes mother I know you snore!) but I had something better to
image
listen to. I had a voice message from Daryl. It really put a smile on my face to hear a lovely Welsh accent as opposed to the grating Canadian I'd endured so far. Sleep didn't come easy, but it was another early morning tomorrow, so night night!

Asia » India » Uttar Pradesh » Agra
March 5th 2015
Published: March 7th 2015


Breathtaking
Today we were leaving Rajasthan the setting of Rudyard Kiplings jungle book (another Disney film I've never seen) and heading back to the state of Utter Pradesh. Our destination: Agra



I was really looking forward to visiting Agra, because 1. It is the name of an Indian takeaway in Sleaford near my first posting at RAF Cranwell, where my friend Ronnie and I had many a happy curry. The deal was he'd drive to pick it up and if I ran in to fetch it I could have his left overs-(I left that posting a stone heavier than when I'd arrived)

And 2. Well the most obvious reason of all. It is home to the Taj Mahal, one of the 7 modern wonders of the world, one of the most beautiful buildings and iconic landmarks on earth, and a famous posing place for princess Di.



My alarm went off at 0615 and 10 seconds later Pearl was hammering down the door to make sure I was up. I don't think I can put up with 2 weeks of this! Luckily at breakfast Raghu told me I could get a single room tonight for an
Agra Fort
extra £10 single supplement, and that was a small price to pay for a good nights sleep.



On the bus, Raghu told us about the different Hindu gods (there are lots!) and about Rama (the one always depicted as a young boy painted blue, holding a bow and arrow, who is the creator of the universe) Shiva who is the destroyer of evil, and son of Shiva who is the most important one of all and who bears the head of the Elephant. Apparently the elephant is an important symbol in Hinduism, as it stands for a good listener (big ears) good sense of smell (trunk) and full of knowledge (big head) Hindus ask this God to bless everything to the point where you can drive a new car untaxed if you are taking it to be blessed. If you move somewhere or buy something it always has to be blessed first.



We had a stop en route and had a coffee and bought some postcards, and it wasn't long before we arrived in Agra, the old capital of India before it moved to Delhi (remember this-that is a good pub quiz question!) firstly
Agra fort with Taj in back ground
we visited Agra Fort which was built by the Mogul emperor Akbah in 1565. It was built as a military structure but was later turned into a palace by Akbahs grandson Shar Jahan who went onto build the Taj Mahal. Shar Jahan was later imprisoned here by his own son for the last 8 years of his life in a part of the fort that overlooked the Taj Mahal which he built as a memorial for his wife who died in childbirth. It is said he spent those years looking at his creation from his prison and crying for his late wife.



We had a really interesting tour here and learned a lot of history about the place. In its day it was decorated with jewels and gold, which would probably be worth billions in today's currency. There was a whispering wall where you stood in certain places and talked and the person at the other side of the room could hear you-so clever. There was even a hole in the wall where a British cannonball had struck and caused damage back in the 1800s. The guide poked fun at me at this point and said it
Yummy lunch
was a good example of why the English are so rubbish at cricket: here was the evidence they couldn't bowl. It was so cleverly designed and built from red sandstone and it was just a lovely place in general with beautiful gardens and flowers. It is still used today by the Indian Army, but we weren't allowed into that part for obvious reasons.



We had another curry buffet lunch, which was awesome-my favourite one yet. Everything was brought fresh to the table and it was kind of like an all you can eat. Paneer was becoming my favourite dish so far, which is not something I usually have at home given that it's a veggie dish, but it was really tasty.



We then moved on to check into our hotel, which was really lovely and clean. I was beaming when I opened my door to see a huge bed all to myself with no snoring to wake me up! It was in a really good location with shops and money exchanges across the road so I went to get some more rupees.

I asked the man to exchange the pounds I had and
Can't believe I'm here!
he just tapped and amount into a calculator and pulled a wedge of notes from under the counter that were wrapped in a rubber band. ' you give me a good deal?' I said, suddenly cursing myself for not checking the exchange rate beforehand. I had a feeling I was about to get ripped off. I had to take my chances though and figured if it was really bad I'd go speak to Raghu.

Fair doos to the man, when I checked the currency on the XE website it was pretty much the same exchange rate as it said on there, so I was happy with that.



Back on the bus we headed for the place which I'm thinking would probably be the highlight of this trip-Taj Mahal. Now I'd heard that after building the taj, Shar Jahan ordered that the workmen have their hands chopped off to stop them ever recreating anything so beautiful ever again. Apparently this is a myth and no such thing happened. What apparently did happen back in 2002 was a restoration project as the taj was becoming so discoloured from pollution, it had a kind of face pack called multani
With the local-Raghu!
mitti plastered all over it to bring its colour out again. This was made from soil, cereal milk and lime juice once used by Indian women to purify their skin. All polluting traffic is now banned from driving within a certain radius of the building now and instead you hop on a type of electric bus to get to the entrance.



There are loads of things you can't take into the place (again for obvious security reasons) and you have to go through bag and body scanners. It was still a lovely sunny day-perfect weather, and I couldn't believe I was here.



Taj Mahal was built as a tribute to Shar Jahan's wife who died in childbirth, and is said to be the most romantic gesture in the world. (Daryl don't worry- I'm happy with just a bunch of flowers now and then!)



As you walk through a small archway, suddenly there it is, right in front of you, and just looks amazing. It was one of those wow moments in life that are few and far between, and it really does look as fabulous in real life as it does
Shakira dressed the part
in all the pictures. There were touts everywhere offering to take your pictures for money, but we'd decided to just take ones for each other. We did manage to get plenty and had a decent amount of time to look around. Inside we visited the mausoleum which had replica tombs for Shar Jahan and his wife Mumtaz. You weren't allowed to take photos or talk in this part, but people were blatantly ignoring these signs and flashes were going crazy. The guards where blowing whistles at those taking pictures and it was generally chaotic-not the serene final resting place you'd think. The best part of the place is definitely the exterior. We got some more great pictures outside and had a walk up to the mosque that is still used for prayer. After the sun set, we headed outside again to get the bus back, but not before stopping by a tat shop to buy a mini model of the Taj Mahal to sit on my bookshelf once home.



For dinner we visited a rooftop restaurant and I had a chicken kebab skewer (I picked this as it was BBQed there and then so I knew it
Nices shoes!
was cooked properly.) Not everyone came for food as they were tired and generally sick of curry, so there were only 8 of us instead of the usual 15. It was a nice having a smaller group as we got more chance to chat, and I even sat next to Molly Brown for the second time today, so as to make an effort to put the snoring behind us. Raghu was telling us how he ended up working for the company, and his family either work in tourism or are in the military. We talked about driving tests in India and how when asked many people, didn't know the purpose of the red light (although the test rules have been said to be stricter nowadays, after the driving experiences here I'm sure most still don't know what the red light is for!)



Raghu had warned us that Agra was a really busy overpopulated city, and to be extra careful here as it was crazy. I didn't find this at all, in fact it was cleaner and a lot less hectic than Delhi or Jaipur was, and wished we'd of had 2 days here instead of Jaipur. Back
Harry & Lloyd!
at the hotel I showered and noticed the extractor fan wire handing just above the shower head (great Indian health and safety) so rinsed quickly and hopped into bed. I only read two pages of my kindle before I fell into an amazing sleep. Today was the best yet, and it's days like this where I'm glad I chose to go travelling and see the world. This Agra was a whole lot better than the Sleaford Takeaway.

Bhubneswar to Varanasi


Mani bathes in the holy Ganges
Varanasi
A couple of disappointments firstly after travelling all the way to Similpal national park I discovered on arrival that foreigners now need a special permit that would take four days to arrange anx I cant sit around on my arse that long. It seems a few years ago some Italian idiots went where they werent supposed to and were kidnapped by Moaists. TheI discovered ghat there were some stunning old temples in Bhubneswar that I missed.

The next morning we drove for nine excruciating hours almost getting killed on more than one occasion before arriving with the dusk in Buddhism's holiest city Bodhgaya. The lord Buddha achieved enlightenment here sometime around the fourth century BC. Later I went into town for a feed good pizza and some banana choc cheese cake.

Nalanda University operated from the fifth century until its destruction at the hand of muslim invaders in the 12th and was the world's first residential school and had ten thousand students at its peak. The drive there was unpleasant their two many people in Bihar and as result the place is filthy and the roads horrendously congested, it took two hours to travel less than a hundred kilometres.
Monastery
Nalanda


It was worth it though, part of the university was excavated by the British, perhaps one tenth of the whole site, the Indians have made no attempt to dig up any more, but they at least make an effort to look after it which is not always the case in this country.

There are eleven monasteries and five temples the largest and most impressive being enlarged multiple times over the centuries. After departing the university we stopped at a couple of minor sites on the drive back to Bodhgaya.

I had Mani drop me off in the centre of town and visit a number of monasteries including the Japanese, Butanese, Chinese and Nepali before having a look at the giant Buddha statue. I then attempted to visit the World Heritage listed Mahabohdi Temple but I couldnt get as mobile phones are not allowed since the complex was bombed by islamic terrorists a few years ago.

Up early and down to the temple the security was quiet tight and I was frisked twice; it was strange to see members of so many different sects in one place many engaged in devotions. The main temple building was nothing
Main temple
Nalanda
to write home about as the star of the show was the massive Bodhi tree descended from the original tree Buddha sat under when achieving enlightenment.

We continued on to the Buddhist centre at Sarnath which has some fine ruins ant another giant Buddha statue. A few kilometres down the road is Varanasi one of the seven holy cities of Hinduism, and for the most part it is horribly chaotic place. I thought I was becoming desensitised in regard to India's ugliness but since passing through Bihar and now entering Utter Pradesh (UP) and encountering the hidious architecture, rotting infrastructure, poverty and filth I find myself becoming angry and depressed.

In the evening I walked among the ghats a long the river they are interesting no doubt about that, though they smell of piss and are over run with touts and drug dealers in the evening. There are huge numbers of foreigners here all dressed in their hippy clothes, Mani even pointed out a European sadu between guffaws.

Happy Valentines Day @ The Taj Mahal
From what I've experienced and observed, there are two kinds of travelers: the first are those who want to go to India, and the second are those who really DON'T. My friend Natalia and I fell into the first category, while both our husbands fell into the second. I think its commonly understood that India brings a shock to all the senses: sight, sound, smell, taste, touch... and not everyone is prepared to leave their comfort zone to experience it. Whenever Natalia and I would meet up over the years to talk about travel, we'd always talk about India with a longing feeling... like when a child longs for something far out of their reach. Then one day, kind of unexpectedly, our India dream trip turned into an idea, and then that idea turned into a solid plan. The plan was that we would use Dubai as our stepping stone to reach India. And Naty's sister Tati, who is a very spiritual person and likes to travel, joined us too. Because we weren't being accompanied by our ""other-halves"", we made sure to hire a reputable guide who not only made sure we were safely escorted, but who also customized our trip
Majestic
to learn and see as much as we could. We'd travel the ""Golden Triangle"" and have an experience of a lifetime visiting Jaipur, Agra, and Delhi. Having a male guide/driver worked to our advantage: he could translate for us, protect us from any vulnerable situations, and provide us with all the information we'd need to understand the culture. Spoiler alert: the three of us actually fell in love with our guide/driver Sunil... Yep, he became like family. But more on that later...

Our India planning started many months before our trip. The India Visa was perhaps the hardest part, as this was the only Visa we've ever applied for that took such a long time to process, so we were smart to have gotten that taken care of first. The rest was very straight forward, and we found flights that were a pretty good deal. One of the other good things about our trip was that it coincided with the cool climate of winter, which I read is much preferred to the smoldering summer heat India experiences almost year round. The mornings were quite cold, but it'd get close
Daring
to 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon. Before our trip, we kept in touch with our tour operator online via emails, and by February we were ready to go to India. What we weren't ready for was what a huge contrast Dubai and India were! Nevertheless, our enthusiasm to experience India never waned, and only intensified the more we were there.





Get Ready for some INSANE Driving....

I must start off this experience by talking about the driving, since that is exactly the first thing we experienced once we set foot on Indian soil. We arrived at the New Delhi Airport, and our guide picked us up in a tour van. It was extremely early, and the sun had not come up yet. Right away I realized we were going to be driving on the left side of the street (like Australia and the United Kingdom does), this was something I wasn't expecting. The other thing we weren't expecting, and that nobody warned us about, was how insane the driving was... and ""insane"" only begins to describe it! I think driving in India deserves it's own blog by itself LOL I will try to
How many people can fit on a motorcycle?
Do you see the motorcycle in the back? The one with a baby wedged in between? Sometimes these vehicles had up to 5 people on them.
describe it with these three main lessons I learned about the driving:




First driving lesson: Indians are fearless drivers. Unless you are Indian, you should NEVER drive here, it is THAT terrifying because only in India is it totally normal to drive right into the path of another driver or oncoming traffic. We started off on the highway heading to Jaipur, and there were trucks everywhere driving all over the place, and they were going really fast, never regarding the traffic lanes, and only sometimes acknowledging the traffic lights. And it didn't help that we were getting this first taste of driving in the pitch dark, which in our eyes looked like utter chaos! Seriously though, how do you drive into oncoming traffic at 100 mph, only to switch lanes and yank the the car into the proper lane at the last minute, and still live to tell the tale? Only in India...






Second driving lesson: They honk their car horns all day and all night long, for pretty much any reason they want, like: ""I'm going to speed up and pass you"" or ""Get out of the way, you
Everything is art
are not going fast enough"" or ""watch out I'm heading straight into your lane""... ya know, all the normal reasons to honk. Even the back of the trucks have signs saying ""horn"" or ""horn please."" Speaking of signs, there are many other random signs on the backs of trucks here... they say things like ""Tata,"" ""Keep Stance,"" or ""Amazing India.""







Third driving lesson: Cars aren't the only things on the road... nope... there are also cows on the street, and elephants, and horses, and goats, and monkeys, and dogs, and camels, and cats, and donkeys. Pretty much anything that can walk. There are also people who are walking onto the street, while balancing baskets on their head and not paying much attention to all the crazy cars around them. Other vehicles driving in the chaos are rickshaws, bikes, mopeds, and tuk-tuks. The motorcycles usually have from 3 to 5 people riding on them and maybe a baby wedged in between... or they'll have 2 tons of merchandise strapped to the motorcycle chair. And the trucks usually have about 20 people hanging on to the side. I can prove all of this, I took
Namaste
pictures and videos! As a matter of fact, I made a simple video of our driving experience and uploaded it, you can see it down at the bottom of this blog. And every single vehicle is literally inches away from each other, as long as they aren't physically touching, it is not considered a problem. And the only real ""crash"" we saw was pretty bad, with people arguing in each others faces on the side of the street over who's fault it was. Sometimes our fear wasn't even about how fast we were going, but how close we were to other cars, people, or animals. The cows are the only beings that the cars will avoid hitting at all costs, this means more speeding, around the cows, into busy oncoming traffic.

Now that I've described what an adrenaline rush driving in India is, lets move on to Jaipur! lol!







Jaipur: My favorite place in India

Jaipur is the capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan, and it's often referred to as ""The Pink city."" Funny thing is that after seeing all the ""pink"" colored facades around, it's pretty accurate to call
Beautiful Halls
it the Pink City! There is something so charming about Jaipur, I really enjoyed it there over every other place we visited. We saw the sun rise as we entered Jaipur, and then got some breakfast before starting our day of touring. Our breakfast and first meal in India was a yummy parantha (Indian bread stuffed with potatoes and vegies), and of corse, you can never start the day here without a CHAI TEA! For every new place we entered, we had a different guide to walk us through the site seeing, and all three of us agreed that our guide in Jaipur was our favorite of our whole trip. There are over 3 million local people living here, and they live in either an urban quarter or a sort of village setting, and they are very humble and hard working. All around us they were getting ready for the day's work. There are animals all over the place of course, but the animal that dominates this area are the Indian elephants. These elephants are so gorgeous, and they are decorated with colorful chalk art, which can easily be removed. As soon as you arrive at the fort you will
Seeing Jaipur from up high
be greeted by these gentle giants and their colorful chalk art. There are long lines in the morning to ride them, and they walk all the way up the fort and back down again.







The Many sites we saw in Jaipur:

The Amer fort is tucked away in a valley in the foothills, and even though it is essentially a fort protecting a palace, it is more like a precious gem. Over 5000 people visit it a day! There are even parts of the fort that resemble the Great Wall of China. Around every corner of the complex there is a new beautiful detail with ancient Hindu and Muslim architecture, and it is mostly built from marble and sandstone. There are pavilions inside the fort which housed Maharajahs, and our guide had lots of stories to tell us about who lived here and what they did. The lake that sits at the bottom of the fortress really sparkles... it's one of those things that you couldn't help but notice because the reflection was so pretty and eye catching. I loved the latticed windows, which all had beautiful views of the lake and
Jaipur City Palace
valley below. The halls inside the pavilion were all originally decorated with mosaic mirrors and gold art; items which are now mostly missing, but what's left of it is protected. We could tell from all the stories our guide told us, that this must have been a lavish place filled with ornamental details to adorn and house the king. It was a very nice place to stroll, take pictures, and listen to the history... a must see in my opinion!





We stopped by a lake to see the Jal Mahal Palace for a quick photo op. It is called the ""Water Palace"" because it's located on the middle of the lake. It's quite nice to see it from afar, where you can get a good view of the whole lake and palace complex. It can only be reached by boat.

The third place we visited in Jaipur was the City Palace, which is a really large palace complex that houses different royal residences, and some very impressive artifacts from past rulers of the 18th century. Inside the complex are a series of museums protecting ancient royal garments and art. There's a large hall with
Pink City Palace
many intricate embroidered rugs and a gorgeous crystal chandelier that I believe our guide said was a gift from another country. We also passed a room with weaponry that they used to use back when the palace was being guarded. Photos are off limits in this area, so I could only take photographs of the outside. I feel like this complex has a lot of history and has some pretty good things to see, but so much of it was closed off to the public, which may make some people feel disappointed. The best you can do is learn about the history.



The fourth place we visited in Jaipur was the Jantar Mantar, which is a World Heritage Site. It houses a collection of archaeological and astronomical instruments built by one of the kings in the early 1700s. It is a great place for anyone wanting to learn more about the concepts of space and time. For example, one of these geometric instruments called ""the sundial"" will measure the placement of the sun and it's shadow, and from that we can measure what time it is with near perfect accuracy... it's astounding that someone even came up
Hawa Majal. The most iconic of all the ""Pink City"" buildings
with the ideas on how to build them in the first place!





The Hawa Majal was the last complex we saw during our time in Jaipur, and it is probably the most iconic pink facade of the whole ""Pink City."" The one thing our guide was able to tell us about this place was that the many beautiful windows of the Hawa Majal weren't only used for decoration but that they also had some sort of screen on them that allowed cool breeze to come in and that permitted the ladies to look through to view the proceedings of the people down below. It is quite high, and very photogenic. Along the bottom is a wide street and a bunch of markets and stores, you can simply pass through or park your car and get a quick picture of this pretty pink building on your way through Jaipur.



Shopping Galore

Before coming to India, we knew we were going to shop... like a lot. It made us thank the heavens we had not traveled here with our husbands because they probably would have been bored to death! LOL However, all the
Traditional Indian Saris
We loved these! Don't we look so local? lol
shopping was extremely fun for us. We tried on and shopped for the traditional Indian Saris, which are seriously one of the most gorgeous traditional dress styles in the world. We had so much fun trying them on, and the store clerks even gave us each an individual colorful bindi to place on our foreheads for the many pictures we took. I didn't want to take the sari off ever! They are so much fun to wear, I even heard them say that I looked just like a Hindu in mine! LOL Tati, Natalia, and I shopped at this textile store and got many things like the saris, scarves, pillow cases, pants, and artisan style purses. We also went to a shoe store and got these gorgeous Indian style shoes which all had intricate beads and colorful designs on them. We visited a jewelry store and a marble store which had great quality stones. It was so much fun browsing and shopping for things that Indian's typically wear and have in their home.



Spending Valentines Day at the most romantic World Wonder of all: The Taj Mahal!

Our four hour drive to Agra from Jaipur started
Taj Mahal
off okay at first. Then, I was awakened by the strange sensation of the car shifting back and forth. It turns out that the road to Agra is quite bumpy, and all the drivers try to miss all the pot holes in the road by yanking the car around them. This means driving right into oncoming traffic in the pitch dark night, at 100 mph. It was so scary, that all three of us were pretty stunned, even after we arrived safely at the hotel... Oh India.

We stayed at a really nice hotel called the Taj Vilas (3 Star), and tried to get a good night's rest for our early sunrise Taj Mahal visit. We got ready as early as 6AM, and went straight out to meet our new tour guide in Agra. You have to ride a pollution free vehicle up to the Taj Mahal, these strict rules are in place in order to keep the air around it as clean as possible and to maintain a protected barrier. Once we passed the lines and got our bags checked, we walked in, and a few moments later there it was... bigger and more beautiful than you could
Showing off my Henna
ever imagine. I loved that it looked like art or a painting, it was so perfect and unreal. The Taj Mahal is perfectly symmetrical, there is just one spot that isn't, and only those who have visited will know what it is! You have to wear these funny looking hospital shoe covers when you go inside, and its included in your ticket purchase. The detailing and little flowers you see on the building are not painted on, they are actually tiny little stones that were individually cut to fit the design. That's pretty hard core guys! That's why it took over 22 years to complete it! There is also Islamic calligraphy that is repeated throughout the building, it says, ""O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord and at Peace with Him, and He at peace with you."" Everyone was there to celebrate Valentines Day (Feb 14th). I sure did miss my husband Victor, and I wish he could have been there with me to experience these moments! We immediately started taking photos. It was very crowded and we knew it was only going to get worse, especially since there was also some kind of government function happening
Cows roaming the streets... typical India!
later on in the day. We spent a nice couple of hours that morning admiring the monument and hearing all the history behind it, and then went back to the hotel to eat breakfast.

After breakfast we continued our tour of Agra by visiting the Red Fort, where we took lots of pictures and listened to even more history. This was probably the moment when we realized that now that we've seen the Taj Mahal, no other building or palace or fort was going to measure up or be as exciting! LOL Sensing our weariness, our guide took us to get our hand henna tattoos, which was one of the things we really wanted to do in India. Then we grabbed some dinner before our long drive back to Delhi. Important advice for your next India trip: try saving the Taj Mahal for last (but don't forget it is closed on Fridays!) One more tip: if you are visiting India you will need a converter to charge your camera/appliances, and we purchased one there for $1 but they are very hard to find, so be prepared.



Our last day in Delhi

Delhi was really crazy...
Garlic nan, Jeera Rice, Curried potato & vegies
sorry Delhi! The traffic was worse and the hotel we stayed at wasn't so great. By this point we were pretty exhausted, even Natalia was ready to throw in the towel! Since Tati is a very spiritual person, she really wanted to visit a Hindu Temple, so we spent the morning visiting different temples and taking our time inside. It was very inspiring watching Tati going up to all the different Hindu statues and presenting her offering, as well as taking several quiet moments to pray and contemplate. Upon presenting an offering, we each got a red dot placed on our head as a religious mark and blessing. Something I almost forgot to mention was that Tati also fed a cow, which held a significant spiritual importance to her. We drove around a bit and noticed that there was a ginormous Sunday flee market going on. I was shocked at the amount of people out, it seemed like everyone in Delhi was out browsing, buying, or selling something! Rows and rows of streets were lined with shoes, jeans, books, shirts, and everything else. We saw one last site in Delhi, which was Hamayun's Tomb, before our guide/driver took us back
India
to the airport to go home. It was an emotional goodbye with tears, as we were saying goodbye to Sunil (our guide/driver) who we got very close to during our trip. Important Tip: a copy of your flight details are required before you can even step foot into the airport. It is heavily guarded and they are very strict about letting people get by.




Conclusions...

We really enjoyed our time in India. We were witnessing one of the world's richest cultures with our very own eyes, and I felt so lucky to be here with my two friends having this amazing experience. Maybe having a guide acted as a cushion to make our experience better. Or maybe the three of us were just very responsible and took extra good care of each other. I expected to have more negative experiences than positive ones, but it turned out to be the other way around. None of the things I feared would happen, happened. That's why you must take your expectations of India and just throw them out the window, it'll never be what you think it is. If India is a place you really want to
Taj Mahal
visit than you just have to go with an open mind and experience it for yourself, and it never hurts to be extra prepared. You will see some very sad things, and some very amazing things too. You will go home with perhaps a deeper appreciation of your life. For me it was an enlightening experience. You will eat some great food, and if you are like us, you will love garlic nan, jeera rice, and curried potatoes! Safe food options, yet extremely delicious. Lucky for me, the food was almost always vegetarian, so there were many options for me to choose from. We loved our guide/driver Sunil... lets just say, his gentle humble demeanor and unrelenting determination to take good care of us during our trip seriously warmed our hearts. We are so lucky we had him as our guide/driver during our entire trip. He is hands down the sweetest guy and driver in Delhi!



This blog dedication goes out to Natalia. Thank You Naty for dragging me along on this incredible adventure! I think we both helped each other finally accomplish this dream trip, but I know that without you none of this would have
Sun rising as we entered Jaipur
been possible. You are the best travel partner in the world, and a dearest friend to my heart. I will always have the fondest memories of all our trips together, and of our friendship! When friends like you come along it is rare... we must cherish them and not take them for granted. Can't wait for what is next to come... so much of the world is left for us to uncover 😊

Skegness may be 'bracing' but Shimla in the Himalayas is breathtaking...and cold! You all know I prefer the heat (in real temperature and curries) but I wasn't ready for this. And nor were the Hotel Deepwoods, nestling serenely on a mountain backdrop staring at the snow capped Himalayas. Organised as ever I hadn't taken my Primark gloves out of my pockets before leaving...and I'm so glad. First night found me wearing said gloves and two pairs of socks in bed with four blankets. On the second night we ate dinner in the apartment. Colin had Chinese (of course), but when the young guy from the hotel saw me; trying to eat with 5 layers of clothes, coat, a blanket and Primark gloves, the rupee dropped! He didn't speak any English, always smiled and agreed, but never knew what we wanted. Now he understood, and within minutes two fan heaters with a combined output of my travel hairdryer (yes I really do have one) arrived!

Two serene, and, compared to Delhi, quiet days saw us exploring tiny markets, climbing the Jakhu Simla to the Shri temple in less than 30 minutes, which qualifies us as 'absolutely fit' for under 30 year olds (just saying) and visiting the summer seat of Colonial rule during the 1930's. Like Colin the Lieutenant Governor obviously didn't like the heat, or am I muddling up spicy food and prevailing weather conditions here? We also visited the local Pharmacy to buy Cod Liver Oil capsules for Colin (?) and the pharmacist spoke far better English than mine at home!



We did enjoy (...or Colin risked...) a curry on our first night in Shimla, in a restaurant which also nestled into the mountain side as the sun set over the snow caps. A fantastic meal I will never forget, but also the start of something costly to me. Fair to say Colin likes it mild...and he's cautious. And so far his 'religious' cleansing of cutlery, crockery, fruit, bottle tops, anything in a ten foot radius really, has kept us happy, healthy and regular, if you know what I mean. But he's also cautious. So we order. ""Would sir like this dish mild?"" asks the waiter, and Colin definitively answers in the affirmative. ""How about you sir?"" and I ask for it hot. ""Are you sure sir?"" YES YES YES !

When far too much food arrives I'm in masala heaven, with 660ml of Kingfisher on standby, just in case. Colin takes one mouthful and utters the now familiar sentence ""I can't eat this"". And so the circle continues, overly large portions, Colin taking one mouthful, and me, a food lover and a hater of anything wasteful (Jersey beans are only secondary to the Scottish) I...EAT...EVERYTHING.



So yes, its costing me lbs instead of GBP's. A good meal with drinks is normally less than 440 rupees for us both, just over £4. That's a darn cheap date night in my opinion. Finally the Monkey Shoulder though. Most of you know me well enough to identify this as one of my favourite triple malts, enjoyed on more than one occasion with the son-in-law. However this one really was on Colin's shoulder, determined to relieve him of his glasses. He succeeded, but we triumphed in victory as they were dropped in the escape. Should have gone to Specsavers I guess, but for one brief moment Colin was wearing an impressive looking rucksack. I need to be quicker with the camera.



Right now I'm being driven to Agra by our personal guide for the Taj Mahal at sunrise tomorrow. He's with us for four days, which has to be easier than the 448 km train journey from Amritsar to Delhi at 5am this morning. Oh, and its hot! The temperature and the lunchtime curry I just had at Motorway Masala. Life is good, and I'm certainly not ready to come home!

The train from Varanassi to Agra was fine, but not quite so luxurious as the last train, as we didnt get a cabin to ourselves. Shared with Japanese girls and their guide. Train arrived in Agra 3 hours later than scheduled time of 6am, despite leaving Varanasi on time. (We have since read in a local paper that trains in the area around Agra have been stopped or delayed by lawyers protesting because they want a high court to be opened in Agra. They have been lying down infront of trains, climbing on trains and generally disrupting! I find this amusing, even though the photo didnt show them wearing wigs and gowns to protest!! (if the rail workers themselves protested like that, I bet they would be forcibly removed, or driven over, quite quickly.)) The poor cab driver from the hotel was still waiting patiently when we finally arrived. We are both feeling a bit unwell (head colds rather than Delhi Belly), so we were glad to check in and lie back down! (On the train one of the Japanese girls put a mask on because I think she was worried about what she might catch from our continual nose blowing.)

We got up again in the afternoon so as to visit the Taj. It is only a few minutes walk away, but we travelled by cycle rickshaw because there are so many men deperate to earn some money driving you about, that it doesnt seem extravagant or decadant. On the contrary, it seems almost rude to ignore them and walk anywhere yourself.

The Taj is the most exquisitely beautiful building I have ever seen. It is also well kept, with no litter or discarded plastic bags in sight, quite unlike the rest of the country. I wont go on at length, since everyone has seen or read about the Taj, and the photos show how it is. There were a lot of Indian visitors as well as foreigners. Again, some wearing really beautiful saris. The interesting thing is that they are as facinated by us as we are by them. They ask if they can take a photo of themselves with us!

We didnt make full use of our stay in Agra or of the hotel (which is the most expensive one I booked in India) facilities due to our colds.......on the second day we got up just

in time for 12 noon checkout, having had a very early night, didnt use the hotel pool, and only picked at a bit of complimentary breakfast. After getting up late we sat on the roof terrace sipping a medicinal tea recommended by the manager for colds, and then had a stroll in nearby Taj Nature Park (entrance fee, no plastic litter allowed, relaxed and refined place with fine Taj views), where there were several much younger indian couples also out strolling. Then it was time to eat and get on an overnight train to Udaipur.

We took the overnight train from New Delhi to Varanasi. The platform was crowded with people....whole families sitting on rugs laid out, or straight down on the platform to await the train. We are very very lucky to be wealthy westerners able to travel in the comfort of a first class lockable sleeping cabin for 2, which even has an electric socket for recharging phones etc! (but by international standards this luxury comes cheap at £300 for a months 1st class unlimited travel including sleepers). Woke in the morning to the sights of rural North East India.....green fields with both men and women working in them by hand, women making bricks of cow dung for burning to dry in the sun, washing being hung out, women sweeping the fronts of their houses, loads of rubbish everywhere (mainly shredded plastic), and cattle wandering about everywhere. At every level crossing there were crowds of people on bicycles waiting for the train to pass. We arrived in Varanassi 2 hours late , having left New Delhi on time.

We took a motor rickshaw cab from the station to our guesthouse after breakfast. Another thrilling cab ride weaving between cattle, pedestrians and various vehicles

along crowded streets. Our driver explained that the guesthouse being in the old quarter beside the Ganges, it is only accesible by foot, so he would walk us the last 1.3km. Fortunately we had very little luggage to carry, as we had left most in storage in Delhi. We walked through the cramped alleyways of the city, passing the occasional cow(!) before he brought us safely to our accomodation. Once inside, it is nicely decorated in bright colours and the location is perfect. There is a rooftop restuarant with a fine view over the Ganges and a staircase leads you down to the walk along the riverfront. The riverfront scene is just as seen on several TV shows....people washing themselves and their clothes in the river, kids playing, people selling stuff, beggars and holymen asking for money, kids asking for money, boatmen asking to take you on their boat, masseuses and barbers offering their services etc etc. All very colourful and quite bewildering....and exhausting. We are so lucky that we can slink back to the quiet of our room or the rooftop restuarant.

In the evening there is a ceremony at the main ghat in honour of the river

Ganges. There are lights, bells, indian music, loads of people and loads of colour. Absolutely amazing spectacle! Lots of people had gone out on boats to watch the proceedings from the river, and there were loads of lights from candles set to float slowly down the river. We have been warned not to give money to beggars, nor to buy street food; but we feel mean walking around with cameras on a foreign holiday when they have so little......so we bought the little candle floats and set them off, and paid to take a kids photo, and for a holyman to put a red dot on our forhead. Seeing so much poverty face to face (even though we all know it exists, even when we are not seeing it) makes anyone feel uncomfortable. There is also a ceremony for sunrise, but we gave that a miss. In the mornings there is a rather nice mist over the Ganges, giving it a mystical air. One evening we went to eat at a restuarant run by a charity that provides a school and doctor to the poor of Varanasi. It was advertised as having 'classical music every evening at 7.30', which turned
Screenshot_2015-02-07-14-23-47
out to be one aging guy with a drum! (but to be sure he was a fine drummer). You had to sit cross-legged at low tables, and everyone there was less than half our age. (They were selling cheese there rom Auroville, which is the ecovillage in south India where Helen worked last summer).

On our last day in Varanassi we took a boat ride. This was excellent. The boatman was nice and told us a lot. (He asked that we take his picture and reccommend him to other travellers....so I will be sure that it has pride of place in this blog). He explained the significance of various parts of the evening ceremony, and what Hindu Gods each represented, but I cannot actually remember! He said, as we had guessed, that the Ganges is low at this time of year and running slowly. After the rain the opposite sandy/muddy bank, where people go to have picnics, fly kites and have horse rides, is covered by the river. The river also comes right high up the steps then and into the lower floors of some buildings. It runs fast at these times and he says he can not work
Screenshot_2015-02-07-14-22-53
then for 2 or 3 months because it is impossible to take boats out. He said some people do fish in the river...but the reason that the flocks of seagulls are following some boats is not for fish, but because the Indian tourists like to feed them. Boats are selling seagull food for this purpose. (The seagulls have migrated from Australia for the rich pickings). We saw the laundry area where the men (yes..men as a business....women for the family) were washing laundry. Saw the burning ghats in the distance. We have not walked down to these, partly because we have been warned about muggers in that area, and also partly because it seems like a bit of a macabre tourist site, which we think we can cope without. We prefer sitting about in the roof restuarant watching the monkeys, the boys flying kites from other rooftops, and of course the view.

taj mahal
HE SAID...
We were leaving Delhi and travelling south to Agra, and we had a very early start. I’d set the alarm for 3.45am, as we needed to leave the hotel by 5am to catch our 6am train. However, we overslept and didn’t wake until 4.30am. We managed to shower, pack and be in the foyer by 4.55am – it’s the fastest we’ve ever moved in the morning.

We jumped into a taxi and made our way through the city’s thick morning fog to New Delhi station. We arrived at 5.30am, walked along the busy platform and waited for our train. When it arrived we clambered on board, found our seats and jostled for space to store our packs in the overhead racks. We lurched out of Delhi at 6am and travelled through thick fog for the entire three hour journey to Agra. Breakfast was included in the train fare, and it comprised tea, biscuits, vadais (fried savoury lentils fritters), uppuma (semolina cooked with onions, peas, cashews and raisins), sambar (a dahl based thin vegetable curry), coconut chutney, bread and lemon water. It was surprisingly good. We also received a complimentary newspaper (the Hindustan Times), so I spent the first
agra red fort
part of the journey reading the ‘matrimonials’ section with headings such as ‘Brides Wanted’ and ‘Grooms Wanted’. It’s become the go-to section of every paper I’ve read since we’ve been in India.

We arrived in Agra at 9am. It was too early to check into our hotel, so we headed straight to Agra Fort. We arrived at 9.30am and wandered around the enormous structure for two hours. It was an amazing place. The Taj Mahal is normally visible from the Fort, but the fog was so thick that we could barely see 100 metres from the fortress walls.

We left at 11.30am and opted for an early lunch at Maya Restaurant. Ren had a dahl tadka (cooked lentils topped with tempered spices) and plain naans (leavened bread cooked in a wood fired oven), while I opted for a kabuli naan (naan stuffed with dates and dry fruits and topped with butter). It was fantastic. We both needed a masala chai (spiced sweet milky tea) to warm up, as our body temperatures had dropped considerably in the chilly morning air. We finished the meal with a lassi (frothy yogurt and milk drink) and headed to Hotel Taj Resorts. Our
agra red fort
rooms were ready, so we checked in, organised a small day pack and made our way to the Taj Mahal. Visibility is best in the mid to late afternoon in Agra at this time of year, so that’s why we were visiting after lunch. If we had gone in the morning, we would hardly have seen a thing. Our fingers were crossed.

We arrived at the Taj Mahal at 3pm. It was overcast and raining, so photographic opportunities were scarce. I thought it was very crowded, but according to the locals it wasn’t crowded at all (due to the inclement weather). I quickly realised that I’d hate to be here on a crowded day! We managed to get a few iconic photos as we entered the main gate before the ruthless camera touts bullied us (and everyone else) out of the way to make room for tourists who had paid to have iconic photos taken of themselves. Bloody tourists! 😉

As we made our way towards the mausoleum itself, the sheer size and finesse of the structure began to sink in. I couldn’t help but wonder why so much money and time was invested into the memory of
agra red fort
a person. If the same amount of money and time had been invested into the emperor’s community, surely the memory of his wife would have had a higher (albeit shorter-lived) influence. However, the impact of this massive structure to India’s current economy can’t be played down, so maybe it was worthwhile after all.

We wandered around the grounds of the Taj Mahal taking pictures and watching other tourists take pictures. Every now and again the rain eased, and brief windows of opportunity opened for photos. We enjoyed capturing the mausoleum from different angles until Ren’s camera battery died. It didn’t really matter, because the late afternoon light was fading, the rain was increasing and the Taj Mahal was slowly being absorbed into the misty overcast sky. It was also getting cold, so after two hours of wandering we made our way through the eastern gate and grabbed a masala chai in a small cafe to warm up. We then jumped into a public shuttle bus and made the short trip back to our hotel.

We headed out to the Silk Route Restaurant for dinner at 7pm. This was in the backstreets of Agra, and it was too cold
agra red fort
and too far to walk, so we organised a taxi to get there. We ordered handi gosht (goat slow cooked in Indian spice in a traditional earthenware pot), kisani aloo (large hand-picked potatoes filled with herbs and spices and grilled in a traditional clay oven), vegetable biryani (dish of spiced rice and vegetables) and naan. It was, quite simply, the best meal I’ve had so far in India. I needed a couple of extra strength Kingfisher beers to calm the green chillies we’d ordered on the side (or at least that was my excuse). What a sensational meal! We had a 7am start the next day, so we jumped into our taxi and headed back to the hotel around 9pm.

On the way I was sitting in the back seat of the taxi, so I couldn’t see the road. Ren was sitting in the middle seat, and she saw a puppy sitting on the side of the road near our hotel. The taxi driver ran straight over it without even attempting to brake. I heard Ren scream just before I heard the dog’s heart breaking yelp. From what Ren described, it didn’t stand a chance. I can’t believe our
agra red fort
driver had swerved at all costs to avoid cows on the road, yet he refused to swerve to miss this dog. Up until that point, the day had been fantastic, but this completely changed the tone of the day.



SHE SAID...
It was still dark when we left at 5am for the New Delhi train station. We were catching the Shatabdi Express train to the Mughal city of Agra, and we were leaving as early as possible to make the most of our single day there. We nearly didn't leave at all as the alarm didn't go off at 3:45am, and I woke to a frantic whisper from Andrew that it was already 4:30am. On the plus side we now know that we can both shower and pack and be ready in 25 minutes flat! 😊

We split into two groups for the 20 minute drive to the station. The traffic chaos was unbelievable, even at 5:30am! The station was already a hive of activity, but the front section sadly had about fifty or so people sleeping on the cold floor. I couldn't tell if they were camping overnight while waiting for trains, or if the
agra red fort
station becomes a default homeless shelter at night.

We were in Chair AC class. The train was possibly the most comfortable we’ve been on so far, and apparently it’s the fastest in India. We left right on time at 6am. The two hour trip turned into three, as the track was very foggy, but the journey still went quite quickly. The train attendant gave us a complimentary litre bottle of water, tea and biscuits, and breakfast. Breakfast was more edible than I thought it would be – brown bread, butter, two vadais (fried savoury lentils fritters), coconut chutney, a palm sized cake of uppuma (semolina cooked with onions, peas, cashews and raisins) and a sambar (a dahl based thin vegetable curry). I didn't have the tub of lemon water, as I was on my usual dehydration routine that I employ for train travel. The landscape remained foggy and frosty for the whole trip, but I caught glimpses of villages and fields covered in a yellow flowering plant as we sped by (I later learnt it was mustard/rapeseed).

We had a quick tour of the city of Agra on the drive to the Agra Fort (also called the Red
agra red fort
Fort). What we saw of the city wasn't picturesque by any stretch of the imagination. I thought Delhi had a stray animal problem until we came to Agra. The number of street dogs, roaming cows, flea bitten donkeys and gangs of thuggish rhesus macaques was really heart wrenching. This was the India of documentaries on poverty – with rubbish heaps randomly scattered through streets, public defecation and rows of temporary shelters fashioned out of any materials at hand. The fog hadn't yet lifted, which added a further layer of grey and damp to everything.

Agra is a city with a rich Mughal history, and it is most famous for the iconic Taj Mahal. The Mughals brought two craft skills to Agra – hand knitted carpets and marble inlay work. I'm not so interested in the former but I was excited about the latter. Agra is an ancient city and doesn't just exist to service the Taj Mahal tourism, but sadly we didn’t get a chance to get to know the real city during our short visit.

We visited the Agra Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage site on the banks of the Yamuna River. Mohsin, our guide through
agra red fort
the fort, was from Agra. He was passionate about the history of the fort and the Mughals, and he managed to convey the details of life in the fort in a way that really brought it all to life. The fort was built by Akbar (son of Humayun) in 1573 for defence purposes, after he declared Agra as the capital. The fort is amazingly huge and built of giant red sandstone blocks. We walked in through the Amar Singh Gate. The four entrances to the fort had different levels of security, including a moat, drawbridge and multiple layers of entrances. The walkway we used was inclined and angled at 90 degrees so charging war elephants couldn’t get a run up before they hit the doors.

During the rule of Akbar’s grandson Shah Jahan (who built the Taj Mahal), white marble palaces were added within the fort walls. Ironically, one of them became Shah Jahan’s prison after he lost power to his son Aurangzeb in 1658. We saw the beautifully decorated rooms where Shah Jahan had spent his last days, gazing through barred windows towards the Taj Mahal.

The palaces inside the fort had beautiful carvings and sparkling coloured
taj mahal
stones inlaid in marble (they used to be precious stones). The palace designs displayed a skilful use of wind and water to keep the rooms cool in summer. There were large hooks for heavy curtains and rugs on the marble floor to keep the rooms warm in winter. Gold leaf and precious stones were used to reflect light in the internal rooms.

We only saw 15% of the Fort (the Indian Army occupy a large portion of it), but it took us over two hours to walk through it. This place totally grabbed me by the eyeballs. I really, really, really loved the architecture and design of most of the areas we visited. The vastness of the complex and the narrow and winding corridors that connected the different buildings were disorientating – which added to the mystique of the space. However, the additions to the fort and palace, which were in very different architectural styles (over extended periods of time), sometimes made it feel a bit disjointed. I really wished we had better light for our photographs so that I could have captured the depth of the beauty in the design here.

We had lunch at Maya Restaurant.
taj mahal
We started with masala chais (spiced sweet milky tea) to warm up! I had a very ordinary dahl tadka (cooked lentils topped with tempered spices), but the naans (leavened bread cooked in a wood fired oven) were fabulous. Andrew ordered kabuli naan (naan stuffed with dates and dry fruits and topped with butter) which he loved. We also ordered frothy yoghurt lassis (salty for Andrew and mixed fruit for me) which were delicious. I noticed that the prices of everything were higher in Agra – possibly because there is a captive tourist market.

We headed to the Hotel Taj Resorts, which was one of the few hotels we've stayed at that was grander on the inside than outside. It was a super clean hotel and the room was smallish but very, very cosy and comfortable. Hot water systems (and their availability) have been hit and miss in most of the Indian hotels we've stayed in, but we had high pressure and scaldingly hot showers here – which was just as well, because we had our first rainy day and the temperature struggled to stay in the double digits. The hotel rooftop would have been quite lovely if the fog
taj mahal
had lifted and the rain had stopped. So for us, the view of the Taj Mahal from the hotel rooftop wasn’t a selling point.

I know the story of the Taj Mahal is well known, but here’s a brief overview of its history (...just in case). It’s a mausoleum built by Emperor Shah Jahan as a monument to his third wife Mumtaz who died after giving birth to their 14th child. He wanted the Taj Mahal to be constructed completely of marble but due to weight issues it had to be made from brick and clad in the stunning white marble which came from Varanasi. Building began in 1631 and took 20 years. Soon after the mausoleum was completed, Shah Jahan’s youngest son Aurangzeb (who is thought to have killed his brothers to secure succession) had Shah Jahan imprisoned for spending too much money on monuments (and to be honest, I would agree with this assessment). Shah Jahan was placed in the Agra Red Fort we had visited earlier, where he had a view of the Taj Mahal and supposedly stared at it for the rest of his days.

I had read that the best time to see
taj mahal
the Taj Mahal was at sunrise or at sunset, and it was late afternoon when we finally arrived at the gates by electric shuttle bus (petrol/diesel vehicles are not allowed within the vicinity of the Taj Mahal). Unfortunately, the sky was still a depressingly uniform cement grey and it had started to drizzle. As expected, before we even got to the entrance we had to fight our way through a scrum of touts and sellers of plastic crap. At the entrance it was a bit disconcerting to see two rows of riot police in full gear on either side of the road. I think they may have been stationed here for Obama’s visit, although the daily newspapers were carrying a story that he had cancelled his visit to the Taj Mahal.

We were given a free bottle of water and white plastic shoe covers to wear over our shoes (when we got to the white marble floors), and then we were pointed towards the outer east gate entrance. There was a gender segregated queue for security, which included body searches and bag scans – no food, hand cream, sanitisers, flammable or sharp objects were allowed in.

As is
taj mahal
common at most Indian tourist sites, the fee for foreigners is much more than for local tourists (750 rupees vs 10 rupees). I think this is fair enough, but I have heard many mutterings from tourists that this shouldn’t be the case. However, none of these tourists seem to complain that as a result of this higher ticket price we were able to skip the very long entry lines the local tourists have to stand in.

The red sandstone walls that surround the Taj Mahal prevented it from being viewed from the road. Once inside the east gate, we walked towards the grand gate - which is a spectacular arch of red sandstone directly in front of the Taj Mahal. As we walked in we could see the top of the Taj Mahal behind the arch, but it was certainly a majestic and breathtaking sight when we finally stepped through the archway and were faced with the sheer size and beauty of it – a mass of white marble set amid beautiful formal gardens. It was quite apparent why it’s considered a masterpiece of architecture and design.

The thing with finally seeing an iconic ‘wonder of the world’
taj mahal
is that you get that strange feeling of matching the real thing in front of you with years of seeing photos and TV footage of it. It is quite surreal, but sometimes an anti-climax too. Luckily it wasn’t an anti-climax in this case.

I don’t normally get that excited about monuments, but for as long as I can remember I have wanted to see the Taj Mahal. And now that I was here, I was totally entranced by the way the light played off the marble (even in such overcast weather) and the meticulous setting of the whole complex. It has such a beautiful and magical atmosphere, and our photos just didn’t do this incredible complex any justice.

There were dozens of stern looking security guards sporting magnificent moustaches (which quite oddly, went very well with their berets). Even though crowd numbers were down due to the weather, there was still plenty of whistle blowing and yelling to try and keep queues orderly and the weird entrance systems flowing smoothly.

We walked down the central path which is flanked by formal gardens and water features. We spent some time circling the raised marble area at the base
taj mahal
of the mausoleum, taking in the geometric precision of the building up close and absorbing the atmosphere. We then walked back down to the red sandstone level to take in the mausoleum from all angles. Even though I have seen countless photos of this iconic building, I had never seen any pictures that showed the whole Taj Mahal complex. On one side of the main tomb is a red sandstone mosque, and on the other, a replica building for balance. The mosque is not open to the public, but the replica building is, and its archways provided the perfect frame for photos of the Taj Mahal. These are incredible buildings in their own right, but sadly overlooked by most visitors. Personally, I think the sum of the parts of the complex is far more beautiful in its symmetry and effect, rather than just the mausoleum on its own.

By now the muted foggy light was lower in the sky, and it provided a good opportunity for that classic photo of the mausoleum mirrored in the water fountains (taken from the raised platform that has the well-known ‘Diana bench’). It had been fascinating to watch the fading light change the
taj mahal gardens
colour of the marble cladding from creamy white when we arrived, to creamy amber by the time we left. The Yamuna River snakes past the complex on one side, and I had planned to go to the gardens across the river for more photos. Unfortunately, that never eventuated because of the watery weather.

While walking around I saw a young couple holding hands at the end of an arched corridor, and it was very romantic; but it made me verbalise something that had been bugging me. This tomb that Shah Jahan built for his favourite wife has always symbolised a great romantic love that ended tragically – prompting many cliches like the whole ‘teardrop on the cheek of eternity’ thing. As true as the story may be, I can’t escape the fact that the love story is intertwined with jealousies and lusts for power within a highly dysfunctional family. Yes, it was built as a tomb for his favourite wife...but to me, the size and opulence of the structure screams ‘gigantic ego manic’ more than ‘true undying love’. Yes I know I’m cynical. 😊

Whenever we visit anything that has a lot of hype associated with it, I’m
taj mahal mosque
a bit weary of how good it will really be. However, I think the Taj Mahal justifies the hype that brings millions of people to visit it. I enjoyed our visit to the Taj Mahal more than I thought I would, but it is a very popular tourist site and plenty of patience was definitely the key to a good experience (even though numbers were apparently down by 50% when we were there).

As much as I was impressed with the architecture of the Taj Mahal, I personally was far more impressed with the Agra Red Fort. That’s probably blasphemous to some people, but I have trouble with very, very expensive buildings that are built as show pieces with no functional purpose. I loved the practical aspects of the fort’s architecture and the clever and beautiful additions that converted parts of it into palaces. I love buildings and spaces that have a lived-in feeling – and quite strangely, the Agra Red Fort felt full of energy. The Taj Mahal, on the other hand, is primarily a tomb and a tourist attraction, and as beautiful as it was, there were no further layers to unravel.

We re-grouped at the
taj mahal
chain Cafe Coffee Day across from the Taj Mahal’s east gate. We ordered hot masala chais to warm us up and then braved the rain and returned to the hotel.

Mohsin recommended The Silk Route for dinner, as they specialised in Mughal cuisine specific to this area. Andrew, Betty, Peter and I caught a taxi there and settled in for what was probably the best meal of this trip so far. On Mohsin's recommendation we shared kisani aloo (potatoes filled with herbs and spices and grilled in a traditional clay oven), handi gosht (goat slow cooked in Indian spice in a traditional earthenware pot), vegetable biryani (dish of spiced rice and vegetables) and naan. The biryani came with a yogurt raita and the aloo came with a green chutney of mint, coriander and green chilli.

We had asked for medium spiciness, so the waiter brought fried green chillies on the side in case we had meant 'Indian' spicy instead of 'western' spicy. Every single dish and side dish was outstanding. I hadn't realised that biryani was a Mughal dish that has been adopted and varied by other regions. This was the best biryani I have ever tasted!
silk route dinner

It was a brilliant night, but it ended very sadly. On the taxi ride home, the driver hit a puppy on the road very close to the hotel. Betty and I were both shouting out that there was a puppy on the road, but either the driver had no idea what we were saying or he didn't give a damn. Given he didn't even try to brake; I'm guessing it was the latter. Andrew told me that I screamed at the point of impact, but I have no memory of that. I still keep seeing the back of that poor puppy's head just before he was hit. So much sadness. Needless to say, the driver didn’t get a tip from us. 😞

Apart from visiting the Agra Red Fort and Taj Mahal, we didn’t explore any other areas of Agra. I’m sure there are lovelier parts to it outside of the main tourist areas, but none that I could see on our very short 24 hour stay there.

Next we head west into Rajasthan to stay in the converted Madhogarh Fort.

Seeing double
Today's the day!

To start we ate at the hotel and I was feeling much better (thanks to a couple little pills to help stop things). The fog was really thick this morning so our guide decided that we would go to the Agra Fort first and then on the main attraction later. Good call!!

The Agra Fort was spectacular. It was a very large red sandstone structure built back in the 1560s. There were many of the usual features similar to the forts built in Europe and North America. They had these holes in the tops of some of the walls that they used to pour hot tar or oil down onto the incoming ramps to help prevent invaders from making it too far into the complex. Then the main doors and many of the other doors were not at right angles so that elephants and other invaders could not ram them head on. Very ingenious.

There were so many different rooms throughout the Fort that were used for many different funations. There were the receiving rooms where the king would receive the visiting dignitaries or his people. Then. there were the rooms that he would use
The Agra Fort
for his private dinners and residency. It would have been quite the life back in the day.

Then we went to see the Baby Taj....very similar to the actual Taj but much smaller. It was built as a mausoleum for the minister of finance for the mogul back then. Quite a structure but small. Then we went to Pizza Hut for lunch.....hmmm.



Then it was on to the Taj. What a building! What a compound in general. Approaching it you don't get to actually see the structure until you are pretty welL looking right at it. Then.....Bam. It is there in all its splendour. We had to go through security to get to the Taj. They took all candy, gum, sharp things, markers, make up and anything the could be used to make a marking on the walls. They even tookmyCurious George animal. Why, I never really understood. They said that they were afraid that I would use it for commercial gain inside the grounds. Whatever...they are just way too concerned about some things and not about others things. Oh well....George goes half way around them prod to see the Taj and can't get in.
Inside by the main gate to the Fort

Even with the fog in the area it was still spectacular to see. The structure rises up and is extremely majestic along the river. The four pillars and the mausoleum are all in white marble that was brought in from up to 300 kms away to creat this memorial to Shah Jahan's wife. Quite the building. There is terrific Arabic writing down the front of the structure that looks very poetic as it flows around the entrance.

There were a lot of people but it was said that this really was not the busy time as it was too cold for many to come. It was really a great day. Very comfortable and easy to get around and experience the grounds and feelings of the area. I am now able to cross another things off my bucket list......yea!!!!

Morning outside our hotel in Toordi
Today was a day of travelling through this vast and seemingly endless country. We left our hotel around 8:30 or so and began our 8 hour bus journey to Agra. Again, out onto the highway system that needs some serious repair work or the vehicles need better shocks! Lol but the view and the scenery along the way was spectacular. Memories of our family road trips to Alberta.

The highway itself was full of ruts and bumps and no lines on the road. It really makes you wonder how they find their way around and get from one point to the next. They just seem to go wherever the wheels lead. People walking on the sides of the roads and highways and Ther are cars coming at you...yes going the wrong way on your side of the divide. How and why they do that will always be one of life's greatest mysteries, but they are still alive and they will do it every day. Go figure.

Along the way we stopped at a large hotel out in the middle of nowhere, it seemed, and had lunch out on the veranda. It was peaceful and quiet and was just us
Hotel we had lunch at along the highway
having lunch. The hotel was amazing.....there seems to be many of these along the routes so people travelling between the cities can pull over and dine or grab a room for the night. Not at all like our motor inns along the highways in North America.

Then it was into this old deep well in a small village just about an hour or so out of Agra. Wow!!! It was built sometime in the 11th century and still survives today. Not as a working well as such but as a monument. The wells are also not like what we know as a well ins he west to supply water. They were very very very large holes in the ground built with stairs and floors going into the ground that would store the monsoon water when it would come. They were very ingenious on how they used and saved everything. It was much blarger then the one that I saw in Ahmedabad.

Then it was on to Agra. One of the expected highlights of the trip. The trip itself was bumpy but with Delhi Belly it wasn't the most joyous journey. I was glad to get to then hotel.
Looking down into the well
I skipped dinner that night and then too bed. I was really looking forward tomorrow.

Dear Travelers,

I am going write my experience about traveling historic places in North India this winter.
The tour plan is like below:-
Kolkata->Lucknow->Agra->Gwalior->Allahabad->Varanasi->Kolkata

No. of persons:-5 including me.
Total tour cost:-50000

First day:- We boarded Jammu Tawi express(13151 / JAMMU TAWI EXP) at 11:45 AM from Kolkata station in sleeper class.I booked online ticket through irctc.in .

Second day:-We reached Lucknow at around 1 PM.We hired a auto (cost Rs. 50) to book hotel as hotel booking was not done previously.The auto took us to hotel Simla palace .You may check review of hotel as below

http://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g297684-d674104-Reviews-Hotel_Simla_Palace-Lucknow_Uttar_Pradesh.html

It cost around 1150 per room (Non-AC with hot water and TV) and Rs 200 extra for 1 person.The room is good for budget.It is advised to check room before you actually book it.


After we boarded into hotel,we took 1 hour for refreshing ourself.We hired two auto for visiting near by tourist spots at about 2 PM .We fixed rate of Rs. 300 (Auto :-09453432833) for each auto after some bargains.We had lunch in Dastarkhwan which cost Rs 1300 for 5 persons including non-veg.

The following places we visited:-

1.Bara Imambara and Bhool Bhulaiya:- A large and impressive tomb complex built in 1783 one of Asaf-ud-Daula's objectives in embarking on this grandiose project was to provide employment for people in the region for almost a decade while the famine lasted. There is an interesting labyrinth too. You could easily spend half a day wandering around these beautiful but crumbling examples of Mughal architecture. If you hire a guide, do not expect him to know the way around. Guides are known to get lost in the labyrinth! The ticket you buy for Rs 50 lets you enter here, the Chhota Imambara, the Husainabad clock tower and picture gallery too, so do not lose your ticket. Please note that lone couples are not allowed to enter with out a guide.Guide will take Rs 240 if you want to visit all 3 spots inside Bara Imambara.

After sight seeing,we bought some chikan dresses which is vary famous in Lucknow.

We completed our day having delicious must try Biriyani and kabab as suggested by our Auto guide.

Third day:-We hired a cab for Rs 800 to visit zoo and residency.We left hotel at 11 AM and completed our tour at 3 PM.After that the cab dropped us on Lucknow junction station .We left lucknow at around 4 PM for Agra in Lucknow-Agra intercity express.Normally it takes 6 hours.

Residency:-It is a must visit place.The bloody history of the demise of this Raj era compound is immortalized in the Museum in the Basement. This was the scene of the 1857 First Battle for Independence, referred to by the British as 'The Indian Mutiny.´ Although you can still clearly see numerous canon ball marks in the ruined buildings, thankfully it is a peaceful place today. So much so in fact, that you are likely to stumble across couples taking a little private time in the leafy shady groves. The Residency is clearly recognised by the locals and tourists alike as a breezy haven to escape from the bustle and dust of a busy Indian city. The Residency will try to sell you a photo pass for an additional 25 INR. The guard will also ask you if you have a camera. However once you are inside, no one will say anything if you take photos. 100 INR for foreigners, 5 INR for Indian citizens.









Zoo:-The zoo is well maintaned and you may visit zoo using either battery operated car or toy train.




Fourth day:-We reached Agra at mid night and booked a cab costing Rs 350 to board hotel (You may contact Sourav 9837551015).our hotel was http://www.priyagroupofhotels.com/.
We booked 2 rooms for Rs. 1100 with Rs. 200 extra for extra bed.The rooms were quite clean and big.But it is suggested to check room before you book.
We hired a cab from hotel for Rs 2200 to visit Fatehpur Sikri,Taj Mahal and Agra fort.The cab was Chevrolet enjoy and it was new.We left hotel for Fatehpur Sikri at around 10:30 AM morning.



Fatehpur Sikri:-It is a UNESCO world heritage site. Built in the the 16th century by the Emperor Akbar, Fatehpur Sikri (the City of Victory) was the capital of the Mughal Empire for about 10 years. Then it was abandoned for reasons that are still something of a mystery. It includes one of the largest mosques in India, the Jama Masjid. It is full of well preserved palaces and courtyards, and is a must see for anyone visiting Agra. In order to get a full idea of this site it is better to take a guide (₹750 for 2 hours for its chargeless entrance part) or have a good printed guide. All entry fees are included with in it. The entrance to the site (even to the yard) is only without shoes.







Taj Mahal:-

Please note that the Taj Mahal is closed every Friday.
The Taj Mahal is an immense mausoleum of white marble, built between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife. Taj Mahal means Crown Palace. One of his wife's names was Mumtaz Mahal, Ornament of the Palace. The Taj is one of the most well preserved and architecturally beautiful tombs in the world, one of the masterpieces of Indian Muslim architecture, and one of the great sites of the world's heritage.
If you are taking a camera, beware that because the Taj is white your camera may underexpose your photos. If it is a film camera you will not find out until it is too late. Overexposure by 1 or 2 stops is recommended. The Taj is open from 6:00 AM to 6:30 PM (sunset) every day except Friday. The gates won't open until 6:00 AM at the earliest, often a few minutes later, so don't bother getting there at 5:00 AM. Entry costs ₹750 for foreigners and ₹20 for Indians. Get there as early as possible to beat the crowds.
We entered Taj Mahal from east gate which is usually less crowdy.But you need to hire a Tanga from parking place which will cost Rs 150.











Agra fort:-
The fort is similar in layout to the Red Fort in Delhi, but considerably better preserved, as much of Delhi Fort was razed by the British after the Mutiny. As much as palace as a defensive structure, it is also constructed mainly from red sandstone.
Emperor Akbar, king at 14, began consolidating his empire and, as an assertion of his power built the fort in Agra between 1565 and 1571, at the same time as Humayun's Tomb in Delhi. Emperor Shah Jahan added to the fort and ended up a prisoner in it. The fort has a beautiful view of his masterpiece, the Taj Mahal, on a clear day.
We visited Agra fort to enjoy light and sound which started from 6 PM.It was really amazing experience and you must not miss it.




We headed towards hotel at around 7:15 PM.

Fifth day:-We hired a cab for Rs. 2800 (including toll tax) to go to Gwalior which is another historical city in Madhya Pradesh.It took around 3 hours to reach Gwalior (120 KM) .We booked a hotel Chandralok opposite to Indian Coffee house.The rate of room was 750 for double bed and 950 for three bed.We had all our lunch and dinner in India Coffee house (beside railway station).The food was tasty and pocket friendly.You can get both veg and non-veg food.After having lunch we visited Gwalior Fort by Auto (Rs. 100).

Gwalior Fort:-The fort is known as the Gibraltar of India and various rulers at different points of time has praised the architectural design and its resilience. It is situated on a hillock with the city surrounding it on all sides , the fort is a very lively one with many of the routines of the city's residents tied to it.We enjoyed light and sound in the Fort which was started from 6 PM and lasted for 45 minutes(Rs 75 for each person).The fort is situated on top of hill.So an older person may have trouble to reach on top.But there is motor cycle service to help in exchange of Rs 100 for single trip.






After we finished visiting Gwalior fort,we went to Gwalior winter fare which is very big and famous to attract tourists from different states.

Sixth day:-We hired a Auto for Rs 700 for local sight seeing.It included following places.

Ghaus's Tomb enclave:-Muhammad Ghawth also known as Ghaus Mohammed was one of the most noted Sufis of his times and he was the guru of Tansen, one of the Navratnas of Akbar's court. The Samdhi of Tansen is also housed in the enclave. The site also doubles up as the venue for the Tansen Music Festival



Samadhi of Rani Laxmi Bai:-
Rani Lakshmibai along with Tatya Tope remains one of the most revered freedom fighters in the minds of the general populace and an annual fair is organised in her rememberance in the Phoolbagh Area. The most prominent road of the city is named after her. Alongside the Samadhi various gardens are situated namely PhoolBagh and Ambedkar which serve as the rendezvous point for the residents and tourists alike.



Gwalior Zoo:-
The zoo of the city is well known for its proper upkeep and kind treatment to animals. The zoo is known for its stellar medical care to animals. The main attractions of the zoo are Krishnamrigs (Blackbucks) and Tiger cubs.




Surya Mandir (Sun Temple):-
The temple is dedicated to the Sun god Vivaswan and was constructed as a replica to the more famous Konark Sun Temple. The temple is constructed using Red sand stone and white marble. It was constructed in 1988 by G.D. Birla , one of the prominent industrialists of the country.



We completed our sight seeing at around 2 PM.We had ample time left to visit Din Dayal Mall to enjoy movie.We reached Gwalior station at 7 PM to catch Bundelkhand express for Allahabad.

Seventh day:-We reached Allahabad station on 3 PM as our train was late because of heavy fog.We hired a Cab for Rs. 3000 (120 KM) to go to Varanashi.We asked the driver to take us in Prayag which was famous for Kumbha Mela.You may enjoy boat ride in Prayag .








We finally reached to Varanashi at around 6:30 PM and booked Raj Mahal Hotel beside Kancha Post office.The hotel is very clean.It cost Rs 900 for each room.We had veg lunch in Shahi Restuarent just 5 minutes away from hotel.This restuarent is very cheap and food is excellent.

Eighth day:-We hired a auto for Rs. 150 to visit Ghats and Mandirs.You can enjoy Kachuri as breakfast which is readily available all over Varanashi.After that we hired a auto to visit Sarnath which is 10 KM away from Ghats.



Sarnath:-It's famous as the site of the deer park where Gautama Buddha first taught the Dharma and also where the original Sangha was formed. Consequently, it is one of the 4 main Buddhist pilgrimage destinations.
Within the deer park complex is the large Dhamekha Stupa, constructed by the Emperor Ashoka in 249 BCE, and several other Buddhist structures that were added between the 3rd century BCE and the 11th century CE.
The town is relatively peaceful and green, and provides a welcome accommodation alternative to those wishing to visit Varanasi but not be immersed in it 24 hours a day.You may take a guide for Rs. 50 who will help you to visit all the renowned places around.




This was our last destinations.We enjoyed very much though it was bit hectic due to long train journey affected by heavy fog.We boarded train for Howrah from Varanashi Junction at about 8 PM .

Tips:-

1.If you visit North India in December ,Please keep in mind that you will face heavy fog which will delay your journey.

The sign says it all.
1.Preface to Vipassana



Ten days of silence. Not just silence but of frequent meditation, separated from books and music and anything to occupy your mind but your mind. I don't feel daunted or scared by the prospect but I am curious and uncertain to an extent. Uncertain about what it may churn up and about how I will feel about ten days of absent presence.

A lot has been said to us of Vipassana, often about how difficult it can be. There is a part of me that is suspicious about these statements. I wonder if they are in the same category as people claiming Delhi airport to be super hectic and chaotic; when we there we saw no evidence of that, certainly not to the extent people suggested. The poverty hasn't been as shocking as I've heard claimed as well, though that is not to dismiss the poverty we have seen as insignificant.

Yet I also know it won't be easy. When normally meditating the greatest difficulty has been thinking that I should be organising this gig or planning that day, etc. What E terms ""restlessness"". With nothing to plan and nothing to organise whilst on retreat, what will my mind lock onto instead? Perhaps anxiety about not having booked accomodation in Gaya? Or the lack of plans we have yet for Nepal? Or even the possibility of not being let into the US? Or something deeper and older? Who knows at this point.

I am looking forward to these 10 days with a mild level of curiosity and uncertainty, and will complete the second half of the article after exiting Dhamma Caka.

2.Varanasi to Vipassana



Though we were in Varanasi for three days it was really only one full day. After arriving into the train station we decided to walk to our guest house by the bank of the Ganga (Ganges), a journey that Google Maps said would take just over an hour. It probably would if you weren't dodging traffic and weaving through the crowd, frequently stopping to wonder exactly where you are and whether you're on the correct path. Even after we'd rached Chowk, the area the guest house is in, the multitude of tiny winding lanes required particular concentration to navigate. We reached the guest house over two hours after leaving the train station.

The room at Mishra Guest House was basic but at 300 rupees a night it was fine, although it was impossible to touch the wall without its chalky blue paint rubbing off onto skin or clothes. The building had a rooftop restaurant that claimed to have wifi but did not for the duration we were there. It did have wild monkeys climbing and playing all over it and they were cute so long as you didn't approach them, at which point they would likely chew your face off. We spent the first night doing little more than resting.

The second day was taken up by a walk along the ghats, a series of connected burial sites used by Hindus to burn the deceased on the Ganga. It was sunny and we spent much of the day not being hassled too much although there were occasionally men very eagre to give me free arm massages. At one point E and I spent 45 minutes sitting on the steps of one ghat, watching people live out their lives, and we weren't hassled once. That was pleasant, and belied the harsh cold we would face within just a couple of days. Later on in the afternoon we stopped at a burning ghat where the dead receive ritual cremation. The body was wrapped in white cloth and had wood built around it, leaving just the feet jutting out. The funeral party (seemingly only ever comprised of males) would then set light to the pyre and ensure it burned until reduced to ash. This happens 24 hours a day at the burning ghats, of which there are a few along the Ganga. We got an early night, preparing for a 5.15am start the next morning.

Like so much else in India, the dailly schedule seems chaotic and intense to my English sensibilities. The day often doesn't wind down until 2am throughout the week and begins again at about 6am. It is not a country that has much downtime.Waking for a 5.30am boat trip along the Ganga gave a rare opportunity to experience a quiet and peaceful Varanasi. We set off in the dark, a handful of others also staying at Mishra beside us in the wooden boat that was being rowed by a quiet local. We were taken down much of the length of the ghats, giving us an opportunity to experience our walk the day before from a different angle, and watched the day emerge from behind thick clouds. It must be stunning in summer, watching the sun rise above the far bank of the river, but it was no less magical watching it grey the morning sky. The magic was slightly undercut by rogue trinket salesman rowing up to our boat and offering to sell postcards/statues/birdfeed/opium though it was perhaps the first time I was genuinely impressed by their determination.

After arriving back at the guest house we had breakfast before packing up and heading to Sarnath, where we would begin our retreat.

Except it turns out Dhamma Chakka was not in Sarnath at all. It lay approximately 5km away in a village called Khargipur. A reoccuring theme of our time in India has been the fact that nothing is ever as straightforward as we (I) assume they will be. After some confusion searching for it in Deer Park, location of the tree under which Siddartha Gotama (the Buddha) gave his first sermon, we were point in the correct direction by a local tourism officer.

I won't give a day by day blow of my time at the Vipassana retreat centre because it was essentially identical day by day. Instead I will outline the conditions and, if you are interested in reading my thoughts about the theory and practice of the meditation technique, then look at section three.

We arrived on the 18th, around 3pm. It began with signing in and being assigned the rooms in which we would sleep for the next 11 days. I was fortunate in receiving a single bed cell, though all the females and most of the males were in rooms of 2 to 3 people. The evening of the 18th established two core principals that would remain until the morning of the 28th, Day 10: first, gender segregation; second, Noble Silence Noble Silence is not just a silence of the voice. Its intention is to silence all external stimulation as far as possible. This meant not only would we not talkbut also there was no reading, no writing, no music, no games, and even no eye contact with anyone else on the centre except the teacher. This applied everywhere, at all times, until the morning of Day 10. Noble Silence began at 6pm on the 18th, whilst Day 1 began at 4pm on the 19th.

Day 1 to Day 10 began at 4am,, when bells were chimed and tinkled wake everybody up. Between 4.30am and 6.30am we would sit in the main hall, or Dhamma Hall, after which a breakfast of porridge would be served. A rest break would follow until 8am when there would be a 3 hour block of meditation in the Dhamma Hall and two 5 minute rests. At 11am we would have lunch of Thali (curry, roti, and rice) followed by another rest before a 4 hour block of meditation began at 1pm. This also consisted of two 5 minute breaks. Between 5pm and 6pm we would have a minimal supper of boonpuri (puffed dry rice) before another hour of meditation that led to an hour long discource by Vipassana leader S.N. Goenka. After this there would be a brief 15 to 30 minute meditation before it was time to return to our cells and have lights out by 9.30pm.

The word ""cell"" is what the organisers themselves used and is not an inappropriate description. The room is made of bare concrete and has little more than a bed inside. The bed was a sheet of metal topped with 2cm of foam. There was an adjoining bathroom but the taps ran only cold water, with hot water needing to be fetched from a large pot over an open fire outside the hall of residence. There was no showering, only pouring water over yourself with a jug. Having not had the forethought to bring a sleeping bag, I made do with two provided blankets for a cover but this proved too little. Ultimately I ended up sleeping fully clothed - and I mean fully clothed, complete with hat and jacket ontop of a vest, t-shirt, long sleeve and hoodie, two pairs of socks and jeans. I still fell asleep shivering.

The nights were cold.

They were also very beautiful in a stark and haunting way. During winter North India experiences thick fog that gave the beautiful gardens of Dhamma Chakka a ghostly quality beneath the compound's blue-white lightbulbs. Beyond the walls a curious mixture of howling jackals, distant steam train horns, and an apparently permanent music festival could be heard. During the day the place was alive with crows, Indian palm squirrels, and the aroma of tropical flowers. Still, we weren;t supposed to be recognising these things so I pretended not to appreciate them.

The days were not easy. Ten hours of meditation a day is an intense process. Sitting on a 3""x3"" cushion, cross legged, for nearly 100 hours over ten days was a sarcastic response by the universe to E's and my desire to stay in one place for a while after spending the previous 11 days almost constantly moving. I spent the first three days simply learning to sit cross-legged for more than five minutes at a time and can now reach about 30 minutes.

The food provided was delicious but the experience of sitting in a hall with 20 others, eating in silence and staring down at the tabke, was a unique one. Waking up at 4am was difficult at first but second nature by Day 3, although the morning meditation for me was comprised laegely of trying not to drift back into sleep. An uncomfortable bed did not make the night's sleep any easier either. The separation of genders was strange because although we slept and ate separetly, the meditation was joined. Being in the same room as E but having to ignore her felt weird, like we had broken up under auspicious circumstances but were trapped in the same house and social circles.

And finally the cold. I cannot emphasise how cold it was, and there was little respite from it. Even during mid-afternoon when the sun was out the opportunity to warm in it was hedged by the four hour meditation block. Yet having said all that I would not have changed a thing. Though I came away with chillblaines on my feet, I believe the harsh conditions reinforced the starkness of the meditation technique. Vipassana was hard but not in the ways I expected. The Noble Silence wasn't difficult because there wasn't much time to read/write/whatever anyway, and the amount of meditation stopped being difficult after the first day because there wasn't anything to pull me away from it.

On Day 10 we were able to speak though gender separation remained. I was finally able to speak to Connor, beside whom I had spent the last nine days yet knew no more than his surname. Talking to others such as Jason and Chirug I discovered that many people had come to the course without any previous experience of meditation. This was definitely a trial by fire. Though we weren't able to eat or sleep in the same room I was able to speak to E on Day 10, an unexpected pleasure. It felt like a long hard winter had moved into spring.

At 6.30am on the 29th we were able to leave. E and I walked through the morning fog along the bank of a stream until we reached the villages that lined the road back into Sarnath. We had momo soup at a Tibetan cafe then caught an auto back to Varanasi.

Our original intention was to head straight onto to Bodhgaya, where the Buddha achieved Enlightenment beneath a bodhi tree, but we decided against that plan as it would become too difficult to then make our way to Nepal. Instead we decided we would get an overnight train to Gorakhpur to begin the adventure northward.

But nothing is ever as sraightforward as we assume it will be. Missing out on getting a ticket for that day by little more than half an hour, we settled on remaining in Varanasi. After spending several hours attempting and failing to get US dollars for our entry into Nepal (here we were helped by a kind man with no expectation f anything other than a photo at the end, clarifying that not everyone in India is out for our money) we decided to head to a place recommended by Connor called Jyonti Guest House.

Though you will probably never read this, thank you Connor. It is a lovely, cheap place in a chilled our part of the city. It is just what we need to recouperate after the retreat. We have decided to see in the New Year here and have a ticket up to Gorakhpur for the 2nd of January. Cheers.

3. Vipassana: Theory and Practice



Vipassana is a form of meditation based entirely within the body. Its ultimate aim is to achieve equinimity through the mental and physical understanding of ""anicca""(meaning impermanence, and pronounced ah-KNEE-cha). Closed eyes meditation is used to increase mental awareness of the sensations of the body, first through gross sensations such as changes in pressure, temperature, comfort, etc and onward to subtle sensations described as vibrations and pulses. By observing these bodily phenomena objectively, the mind cultivates neither positive (""craving"") nor negative (""aversion"") reactions to all forms of sensation because it recognises that all sensations are impermanent, being born and changing and fading away. The 10 Day course spent the first three days focused entirely on anapanna (mindfulness of breathing) to calm and focus the mind before teaching vipassana on Day 4.

My primary issues with retreat were in the discourses, hour long videos of Goenka developing and explaining his take on vipassana, that were shown at 7pm every day as well as a bonus debriefing just before we left on the 29th. One of the first things Goenka states in the first video is that ""this is not preaching"". By Day 3, I was pretty convinced this is the equivalent of someone saying ""I am not racist but..."" because the discourses were pretty heavy in promoting Buddhist ethics and philosophy in a way that made them seem like a sort of meta-philosophy that existed beneath and beyond all others.

This was underlined by Goenka regularly stating Dhamma as the ""Universal Truth"", a phrase which immediately sets off my bullshit detector. I do not believe it possible for there to be a universal truth, particularly within philosophy and ethics where subjectivity, history, culture, and even species (ie the points of view of non-human life) have the potential for near infinite possibilties. Even though the fundamentals of Buddhism as I understand them are fairly righteous, I think it would be a gross over indulgence to state they are a universal truth.

A second claim made by Goenka and the teacher of our course was that vipassana is ""scientific"". Again, the claim to science is something that sets off my bullshit detector as its most often said of things that are thoroughly unscientific. This statement is aimed directly at the notion that vipassana enables the practitioner to feel the vibrations of subatomic particles (called kalapas) through his or her body (and it is through observing this phenomena equinimously that one achieves Enlightenment). I have very little knowledge of physics or biology but felt this idea to be implausible. I believe that the practitioner might believe they can feel such vibrations but that this is at best an unconscious visualisation. Because Goenka adamantly insists that practitioners do their best to avoid visualisation, they they need to focus only on what really is there, and thus implying a genuine belief in the ability to sense subatomic vibrations throughout the body, I couldn't get past what I felt was a bit of hokery.

Then there were two problems I had with the fundamental approach of vipassana. The first is with its mechanisation of the body. As stated above, vipassana uses bodily sensations to develop equinimity. To do this the technique asks the practitioner to take sections of the body and sit with them until a sensation arises, or if there are no sensations then for a minute or two, before moving onto the next section. As sensations become more frequent and subtle, the size of the section decreases. At the most advanced stages the practitioner will be taking fingernail sized sections and sweeping up, down, and even through the body. My issue with this is that it turns the physical body into little more than a tool for the mind, that our bodies are just a means for minds to become ever more powerful. I cannot get on board with this. Our bodies are things in themselves, with each limb and muscle and bone and cell and all the bacteria that exist amongst them having existences that our mind, powerful though it is, might never know. Sometimes we are a mystery to ourselves, and that is okay. The reduction of the body into a whetstone for sharpening the mind undermines that.

The second problem I had was more personal but relates to the way in which vipassana transcends the body versus the way in which anapanna meditation does. Vipassana I found awkward in a similar way to metta bhavana in that it requires an active engagement of the mind whilst simultaneously trying to discourage engagement of the mind. Conversely, anapanna's pure focus on breathing in and out decreases the need for active engagement of the mind. As vipassana practice strengthens the meditator will eventually reach a stage where they feel (whether scientifically possible or not, it is fairly irrelevant for these purposes) their entire body to be vibrating and through this vibration they are able to experience complete impermanence of the body and thus achieve a total dissolution of their physical and mental self.

At university I remember we undertook detailed analysis of Alice Oswald's epic poem Dart, analysing stanzas and verses so finely that by the end they almost no longer made sense. This is what I believe vipassana encourages, at least within me. To me this makes sense only as a sort of physical version of semantic satiation, the name for that moment when a word or phrases no longer makes sense because you have said or read it too many times. I find this to be negative for the same reasons as stated in problem one, that it is almost becomes a rejection of the body. When undertaking anapanna I have once or twice reached brief moments of what I would also call a dissolution of the self but in a much more body-connected way. My mind simply ceases to be tethered to my body. I can still feel its existence and its reality and solidity, but because my mind feels as though it has opened up a non-space about itself, it feels more like a coexistence than some triumph of mind over body. I analogised this to E as vipassana being like an explosion of the body and anapanna being more a tunnel through the prison wall of the mind.

There is nothing inherently bad about vipassana and I believe it is a technique that will work for and benefit many people. However the discourses definitely erred toward implying that vipassana is the only form of meditation worth putting most of one's efforts into. This brief analysis has been an attempt to illustrate why I feel this is not necessarily the case.

4. Details from Vipassana



There were some memorable moments throughout the course. Here are some I committed to memory.

- The paths are dotted by occasional blue-white lamps that make the grounds ghostly amongst thick fog. Because of Noble Silence the others stare at the floor as they measuredly pace back and forth along these paths, and because of the cold they are draped in blankets that sway with each step. This place is a colony of revanents.

- One afternoon I watched a crow feed on a mouse. Looking up through a tree, a small grey body swung from a branch. Its pink innards were exposed and trapped beneath the crow's claw as it pecked at the eyes. The crow saw me and hopped one branch further away, turned, knew that I was still watching, and continued hopping to further branches until it was happy that I won't try stealing its dinner for myself.

- Within 20 minutes the weak winter sun turns from layering the world in a champagne gold to becoming a deep red disc descending through an orange sky strayed with pinks. As it slouches below the wall and beneath the horizon, everything above turns a bruised blue-purple and leaves the earth a gathering of silhouettes. The moon is stuck like horns above a tree.

- I can hear jackals but I will never see them.

Glad to have Ian and Dan for Christmas!
Another typical Indian experience: As promised and to the whole family's relief I had my beard shaved off at the barbers opposite the Old Delhi Zostel. Apparently I now look younger. And we are no longer in Central Asia where 'grey beards' are respected. So I agreed 150 rupees for the shave and haircut. Before I knew what was happening I was having a face massage as well and lo and behold that was an additional 250 rupees. It wasn't that special. I think the family are pleased with the result.



We have done the Old Delhi sights now Ian and Dan have joined us and we are based there. The Jama Masjid is a huge mosque and was the only opportunity we have had to date to climb a minaret. It was a classic Delhi view - the city stretching out before you until it disappeared into the smoggy haze. From there it was a short walk to the Red Fort. This was our first major Mughal palace. It must have been mind blowing in its opulence when Shah Jahan ruled this part of the world. We managed to take shelter to avoid an unseasonal shower and

lightning show.





We have also discovered we can fit four people in any sort of tuk-tuk. In the smaller version you get in Delhi they don't allow you to sit next to the driver so Jane had to sit on someone's knee and the three boys jammed on the seat. A cycle rickshaw is limited to three!



We did two contrasting walking tours in Delhi. The first was a food tour. It was very much at tourist prices and offered a wide range of excellent food. We went to a famous old jalebi store. They were thicker and less crispy than the ones we had in Amritsar which most of the family preferred. I missed the crispness which gives you a shot of sugar as you crunch it with your teeth.



The most interesting stop was for lemonade. It is made by the shop in bottles stoppered with the a internal glass marble that you press down to break the seal. You can drink it straight or they add 'marsala' powder, which makes it smell like a sulphur spring, or they add marsala and lime which gave it a
How many Drummonds can you get in a tuk-tuk
cumin flavour. Ian and Dan were happy with the plain lemonade, I liked the cumin flavour and Jane was not tempted by any!



A highlight was the butter chicken restaurant. It serves butter fish or butter chicken, that is it. Marinaded barbecued chicken kebabs were served in a butter cream sauce with chapatis. Very nice and probably the most calorific dish we have had on our travels.



We got to taste buffalo for the first time, served as part of a famous biryani. I am also developing a taste for Rasmalai. We had had this first in Amritsar. It is a cheese pudding in milk flavoured with saffron and green cardamom. I prefer them to the kheer (rice pudding) although Jane would disagree.



Our second tour in contrast was run by the Salaam Balaak Trust, a local charity helping homeless street children in Delhi. The tour guide was Ajay, who they saved from the streets when he was 11 (although he is not sure of his exact age). He was sleeping at the railway station and was badly beaten by police (they all have big sticks) as they cleared an area.
How many Drummonds can you get in a cycle rickshaw
This lead him to visit the trust's drop in medical centre by New Delhi station and the social workers helped him from there. He described the life of the kids - sleeping rough, pickpocketing, sniffing glue and watching movies. We also got to meet some of the boys in the nearby care home. Some were extrovert and happy to play simple games. Others were clearly more troubled and struggled to interact. It is quite a struggle. At any one time the trust are helping 5000 of the 200,000 street children in Delhi.



The next stop was Agra and the Taj Mahal. I had never been enthusiastic about Agra having been put off by the tourist hype. It was not an essential stop as far as I was concerned. Jane, Ian and Dan thought otherwise. They were right. We visited for sunrise and it truly is a magnificent building even up close. I guess what makes it special is that it is a symbol of love from a man, Shah Jahan, who had more wealth than almost anybody. The proportions are so eye pleasing from almost any angle. Inside the marble screens and inlays are exquisite.

Making Jalebi
The liquid dough is wheat and lentil flour and yeast piped into hot oil. The cooked jalebi are then soaked in sugar syrup


Shah Jahan is buried next to his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, for whom it was built. He spent the last twelve years of his life looking over the Taj from his house arrest in Agra fort, where he had been imprisoned by his son. The Agra fort probably upstages the Red Fort with its views of the Taj, marble palaces and courtyard gardens.



Agra was our third Zostel. It had only been open for 50 days and currently is not matching the others we have stayed at. We had a four bed dorm with ensuite which was fine. They also did a good city walk (although I bunked out with Dan halfway as he was turning green). The staff were friendly. The breakfast offering was very basic and having handed in laundry on our first day it was returned as we left unwashed because the 'dhobi' had not picked up! I told them to change him!



On our last day in Agra we went to Fatapur Sikri. This is an old Mughal capital. Akbar, Shah Jahan's grandfather, spent over 10 years building it and moved there from Delhi. After a mere 14 years
The lemonade shop
he died, the capital moved back to Delhi and it was abandoned. It was very misty in the morning and the rickerty bus ride got very cold as we travelled through the open country. It gave us time to chat to a group of men who had travelled up from Madhya Pradesh. They were interested to see what the Lonely Planet said about their home area (apparently the locals eat red ants!). The men were a very mixed bunch and apparently were from the same village and on a week's vacation in the area.



The mist cleared as we reached Fatapur Sikri. The Victory Gate entrance into the mosque towered over the town below as clear symbol of power. Ian almost knocked himself senseless on a stone cross beam in the palace. The palace had some beautiful carvings and a unique monument to Akbar's favourite elephant executioner (it used to crush criminals in front of him). The monument is a Minar with brick tusks pointing out in all directions.



That evening we were back on the train again. The Saturday trains had all been fully booked so our only option was one on Friday
This is as close these guys would let us get to India Gate
evening that got to our destination at Sawai Madhopur at 2am. I must remember to shave in the morning.

When is couchsurfing not really couchsurfing? When it is three days with Biren Thapar in Lucknow.

At first I felt a little like I was in the belly of the beast. Biren Thapar comes from an upper middle class Indian background, full of ""old money"" and servants inside a grand mansion. These are the people I set myself against in the UK, whether talking about politics or out sabbing in the Waveney Valley. Yet there he was, opening up his home and his resources to travellers at little more than a couple of days notice, lavishing us with food as soon as we arrived and not asking for a penny.

We had our own private en suite bedroom that, coming after a dingy night at the Diamond Hotel and a rough few nights in Jhansi and Agra, was beyond our expectations. There was clean sheets, enough blankets for both of us to stay warm, and a shower that gave out a steady supply of hot water!

The first day with Thapar had us breakfasting and having lunch with him before his driver Vinod took us to The Residency, which contained the ruins of a grand mansion with auxilliary outbuildings set inside lage gardens. It was almost a castle. Ultimately the place became the site of vicious battles during India's 1857 independence war that killed most of the British living there. Though there were many other people there its size meant it was peaceful and calm. It was a much needed break from the chaos of India we'd experienced so far.

Thapar is an interesting dude. He is rich and has led a fairly comfortable life from what I can gather, at least economically. His background has afforded him the opportunity to master painting and drawing, to learn at least four languages, and to have mastered the finer arts of international cuisine. These are not traits associated with the poor or even lower middle class of India so far as I can tell. Yet accompanying this is an undeniably liberal outlook on the world, with an understanding but low opinion of India's caste system and fairly critical views of the machismo of Indian men. Furthermore his participation in couchsurfing went totally against the grain of his social circles, many of whom didn't understand why he chose that over a homestay system from which he would earn money. His explanation was simple: couchsurfing builds an economy of trust rather than capital. This was bourne out by his help in putting us in contact with other couchsurfers in places that we will be visiting as well as introducing us to another souchsurfing host in Lucknow, Ajay.

Our second day saw us go to the Bara Imambara, a grand Mughal palace now turned into a tourist attraction. Thapar had mentioned he'd got us a cheap deal on the entrance fee but when we got there we found out it wasn't cheap, it was free. Vinod had driven us there and bought a pair of tickets for us. We spent 20 minutes or so looking around the beautiful hall of the Bara Imambara before heading upstairs to what I thought would be the balconies. Before leaving, Thapar had warned us against going into what is known as the Labyrinth, saying that once in it can be impossible to get out without a tour guide. After reaching the balcony and getting a lovely view across the Lucknow we decided to return to the front gate and move onto another attraction further down the road. Except that as we attempted to retrace our steps we found ourseles becoming increasingly lost. We had, by complete accident, trapped ourselves in the Labyrinth.

It took the best part of two hours for us to find our way out again. Although there were many people around none seemed to speak English, and every set of stairs we ascended or descended seemed to either take us to a dead end or back to where we began. Eventually we found the way out using some simple logic and the panic of spending a night in haunted concrete mazes subdued.

That evening Thapar had invited Ajay and Ritu, his wife, over for coffee and then to take us out for a meal. We went to a pretty upmarket restaurant called Barbecue Nation where we shared the contradictions of English vs Indian culture (they were surprised we didn't eat meat, as their perception is that everyone outside of India eats loads of meat) and had a generally lovely time making fun and sharing conversation. Throughout there was an underlying worry for me. This was clearly not a cheap restaurant and E and I are aready running way over our daily budget due to the Delhi Mistake. By the time we were half way through I absolved these anxieties by accepting that we were fully committed and we'd just chalk it up to a one-off extravagance. When the bill came however, almost before I'd even had a chance to notice its arrival, Ajay had paid for all four of us. That's right. Despite our protestations he refused to take any money from us and even drove us from and to Thapar's place.

Jesus christ. This isn't normal couchsurfing, is it?

Our third and fourth days were a bit less grand but no less enjoyable. We went to a local flowershow where we were approached by an old man and his grand daughter wanting to have a photo taken with us and then invited us to have dinner with them. I am not sure why. It was unprompted and unexpected, and I can only assume it had something to do with us being white. That evening we had dinner with Tharpa and some of his old family friends and got to experience inside the social life of India's liberal elite. Their conversation and their style of conversation is radically different to anything I have in my life, being very much au fait with popular trends and the rich and famous of Lucknow. As they talked I thought to myself that this is likely exactly how the upper classes of Britain, and probably the world, converse. It struck me that the similarities of a class across the world are more similar than between different classes within a single nation. I hope this can be true for international working class solidarity today.

We spent our last day at the La Martiniere College, a presitgious local Catholic college and Tharpa's alma mater, before moving onto the ""poor"" suburb of Chowk. Here we were at first hassled and later simply accompanied by two cute street kids that followed us half way across the suburb before disappearing at a bridge. We had dinner withtharpa before heading to the train station to catch our train.

Throughout our time with Thapar, it was his servants that really struck me. Anju did almost all the cooking in the house and her food was outstanding. It was a taste of true Indian food that surpasses the best Indian food I have had in the UK. Netram, the housekeeper, worked incredibly hard to keep the house clean, our food and drink served, and even did our laundry. Vinod drove us, paid for our entry to the Bara Imambara, and helped us navigate our way through the city by highlighting important landmarks.

Biren Tharpa is an unparalled host and his offering could not have been accomplished without the help of Anju, Vinod, and Netram. Though we were unable to repay them in any true way we hope to carry forward the spirit of generosity and trust they offered us. It has also inspired us to offer more than just a sofa for couchsurfers at our place in the future.

After a chaotic first week in India, Lucknow proved to be a welcome oasis that helped us regenerate before moving onward to Varanasi, Sarnath, and our 10 day Vipassana retreat.

Banana and Apple lassi at Blue Lassi
Koen had another delight.
When the lassi arrived it looked like a cocktail. Well Ajay (along with LP) had said that Blue Lassi was the best lassi in the whole of India. At that moment the long 24 hour train journey to Varanasi definitely seemed worth it. A steady stream of dead bodies being carried down the passageway outside the shop on bamboo stretchers wrapped in bright cloth just emphasised where we were, the most auspicious place for any Hindu to die.



It certainly is all here in Varanasi. The ghats ('steps') stretch all the way up the side of the Ganges from the confluence with the Assi river. We spent the morning people watching and wandering up the river's edge. There were locals bathing, praying, washing, small boys skilfully flying square paper kites and, of course, the funeral pyres.



The 'pyre' process is in fact very pragmatic. We asked one guide why there is no sign of grief. ""That is done at home"", was the reply. It is only the men in the family who burnt the body. They wash the body in the Ganges first. They buy the wood from the fifteen or so families who run
The ghats looking along the Ganges pass the old city of Varanasi
the two 'burning' ghats. The wood is weighed according to the body weight. The oldest son then buys the fire from where a flame burns 24 hours a day. It takes around 3 hours for pyre to turn to ash. There is no sign of emotions. At this point the soul has left the body. At the end what is left is chucked in the Ganges. The pelvis has not burnt and there must be stacks at the bottom of the river. We saw some men panning the ash by the river side for jewellery left from the bodies.



At the end of the walk having got lost in back alleys we found the Post Office as we wanted to send some cards. This gave us one of those great Indian moments. We had 18 cards which each needed 25 rupee (25p) worth of stamps. The largest stamp they had was 1 rupee so each card needed 25 stamps. We sat behind the serving counter gluing them on before a man franked them all with gusto. It will be interesting to see if any of them get through.



Varanasi was our first Zostel. This
The Manikarnika 'burning' ghat
This is where 200 out of towners are cremated every day. locals use the Harishchandra ghat up river.
is a new company set up up by 7 guys in Calcutta. They are opening up backpacker hostels throughout India. Currently there are eight and there are plans for another fourteen. Ajay was responsible for opening up the Varanasi hostel and was a fantastic host. He was actually from Kalpa in the Kinnaur valley in Himachal Pradesh. He was the only son of a family that had 400 apple trees in the valley. He had got a good education and was working for Zostel opening up new hostels. He wanted to travel to Europe and once he took over the orchard dreamt of opening his own school back in Kalpa.



We had a very acceptable double room with ensuite for 1000 rupees a night. The hostel had a open relaxation area and up stairs a kitchen we could use. So on both evening I bought ingredients from street stalls and then cooked them under the watchful eye of 'Opi' the resident chef. He was a great character and we had fun watching him work and learning from him.



Ajay and the team were also fantastic when I succumb to Delhi Belly. (I discovered it
Opi in full flow in the Zostel Varanasi kitchen
Note the essential spice tray
was easy to throw up in a street in India as there are usually open drains on both sides.) They gave me a spare room to lie down in and boiled water for me to sup before we had to leave to catch the train to Delhi. We look forward to staying in other Zostels on our trip.



One evening Zostel put on a session of classical Indian music and dance. There was a drummer and the second player started with a hand pumped harmonium before moving to a sitar. To start there was also a female dancer whose shin bells shimmered in time as she stamped her feet and whirled on the spot. The players watched each other confidently and kept so tight.



We did the city walk with Yann from Brittany, an experienced traveller and Koen from the Netherlands. Yann's Mother apparently spoke and wrote Breton. It was a sign of the times that Yann was fluent in English and Spanish and spoke no Breton.



One evening we watch the 'ganga aarti' ceremony as we had done in Rishikesh and Haridwar. We took a boat like many other tourists
Dashashwamedh Ghat preparing for 'ganga aarti'
Note the man in the bottom left has just made his chappati dough with water from the holy if toxic river Ganges
to see it from the river. It was fun to row on the Ganges and our boatman was a knowledgable guide. The five performing the ceremony on individual raised platforms were students at the local university. The ceremony seemed to lack the spirituality of the ceremonies we had seen previously. One got the impression the focus was on money raising And seemed to be effective.



We left Varanasi as we have arrived on a long train ride. We were looking forward to getting to Delhi to meet Ian and Dan flying in from the UK. The train was due to leave at 6pm and left at midnight. It was due to arrive at 10.30am and arrived at 7.30pm. Ah well, that's India.

From the moment we arrived at New Delhi train station until the second we arrived at the door of Tharpa House, 5 Park Road, uncertainty has beset our hours.

We have taken a massive roundtrip from Delhi to Agra, Agra to Jhansi, and Jhansi to Lucknow during which I have felt like we've just about kept our heads above the surface. Firstly it has felt much like people's only interest in us, whether it was unwanted hassle or superficially nice aid, was based around getting money from us. Often this wasn't even a huge amount but it is the assumption that we, as white tourists, must have money to chuck around. It is the first time I have felt really subjectified by my white skin. It isn't the end of the world but during the midst of the experience it has felt very overwhelming.

This has been an issue, too, when people have begged for money. Often they are clearly poor, and clearly would benefit from 50 rupees far more than E and I would in the long term. Having to say no, and even having to blank the frail old women as she continued banging on the car door for 90 seconds or so, becomes difficult. I am not one to fall for white tourist guilt but it's not like I don't care either. E has mentioned how in the past she has criticised (as have I) people with money for turning away from the poor - and there we were, doing the exact thing we have been so critical of in the past. It is a humbling experience.

Twice, in two different towns, we have been followed quite aggressively by an auto and a rickshaw driver. Whilst most drivers will accept no for an answer, these two seemed set on following us until we were able to lose them. The auto driver in Jhansi followed us for 25 to 30 minutes as we searched for a place to stay in town. His persistance began to unnerve me; I began thinking his intention was to bundle us away down a dark alley and leave us with little more than blood leaking from our kidneys. Eventually we found Hotel Shrinath Inn and got a room whilst he continued parked up outside for us for who knows long?

All of these experience resulted from our own first mistake. In retrospect it seems obvious that the foreign ticket office in New Delhi train station wasn't closed but at the time we believed it. Perhaps endeared by the lovely time we had at Wongdhen House and the New Tibetan Camp, we believed this man when he said the only way to get a train ticket would be to visit his tourist office 20 minutes away. It's almost embarrasing writing this because it seems so obvious but I am not embarrased because at the time we believed it and that is the way things were. Ultimately we were sold a package that is convenient, took us through Agra (where we pretended to see the Taj Mahal, but didn't because it cost over 500 rupees and had long lines) en route to Jhansi, and has arranged train tickets for us up to Varanassi. It included accomodation for one night in Agra but other than that little more than train tickets for a total of £98 per person.

Yeah, I am embarrased by typing that.

The round trip has also resulted in spending more money on accomodation than we'd have preferred to. I can't blame this on anyone but ourselves though. That's entirrely don to our naive belief that we could turn up in a town and find somewhere fairly cheap to sleep at the drop of a hat. Our room in Jhansi was pretty ramshackle and involved an awkward 30 seconds with a bell boy - that hadn't actually done anything - closing our room door very slowly whilst we didn't give him a tip, and our first night in Lucknow resulted in spending nine hours in a room that could almost certainly only have been used for illicit sexual pleasure.

Although we had arranged for a courchsurfing host in Lucknow, the 2.5 hour-late train (a total journey time of nine hours) meant we turned up close to 11pm and much later than expected. We took an auto with a driver with whom we had no common language and so found it desperately difficult to communicate our destination. He carried us to the exact opposite side of town and demanded four times the fare when he eventually got us to the correct location 45 minuts later. Most of the hotels were booked up so we after over an hour of searching accepted an 800 rupee bedroom at Hotel Diamond that wasn't even on their room listing. It didn't have a duvet or a sink, and the windows didn't shut properly, but it was a roof for a night. The day has been a real lesson in patience.

The past 48 hours have been a chaos of our mistakes, the underhandedness of others, and a real clash of cultural norms that have left me feeling genuinely naive although not deterred. I am happy to have handled the whole thing without too much anxiety and I am proud E has handled this with the utmost kindness and radiance even if it has led to tears for her. We've learned many lessons. I am sure we will learn many more.

At 11.35 this morning we started making our way to our couchsurfing host at Tharpa House, 5 Parkroad. It turns out the place is literally a mansion and he wants us to have loads of delicious food and won't take no for an answer. I'll talk more about it next time. Check the Flickr for photos of some lovely bedrooms and our tired, miserable faces.

Quick catch up as it's been hard to get wifi!

Friday night was very special in Cochin as we went to the very old Pardessi shul there. It was so beautiful with the light and candles. Fortunately there were ten men for a minyan, including our group, and lots of women. It was very special to daven in a shul that is no longer viable with only one old jewish lady, Sara Cohen, living nearby.

Saturday eve we watched a kathakali performance. We saw how their make up was skilfully painted on and were shown some of the gestures used . We then watched a dramatic play, performed to music.

We have now flown to. Delhi where we saw a couple of heritage monuments, and are now in Agra where we have now visited the majestic Taj Mahal. Wow! It really does live up to its reputation.

Tarring up the bottom
Current Mood: Overwhelmed.

From the Train of Doom to a River of Belief Varanasi was as every bit shocking as I had imagined it to be. It was also one of the most colourful places in the world that I have ever been.

After wobbling from the train with extreme exhaustion and poor Casey following in the worst condition anybody could be, we finally got a rickshaw to drop us at the Ganges and it wasn’t long before we had searched and found a room at Hotel Ganges View just south of Assi Ghat on the Ganges River.

Slightly above our budget (as we were in need of some pampering) we paid up the room for 6 nights for 9000 rupees and decided to sit tight with a little view for my birthday week. Unfortunately everybody was sick so on my own I took a shower, fixed Casey’s broken sunnies and went for a mosey of the streets in search of goodies for when the better half came good. After a few beeping horns and a great cheeky Chai I decided to head back to the room to take advantage of our satellite TV and comfy bed. Waking
Adverts, Art and a place to Sleep.
anything is possible in india
in the morning Casey was feeling much better so we decided to take a little stroll down the river to check out a few of the main sights here on one of the most polluted rivers in the world.

In case you aren’t aware of why thousands of people visit Varanasi on the Ganges river here it is. Amongst Hindu beliefs one of them is that Varanasi is the Holiest place to die. Expiring in Varanasi offers Moksha (liberation from the cycle of birth and death) and is quoted to make Varanasi ‘the Beating heart of the Hindu Universe’. On our stroll from the south you begin by passing small lanes filled with dust that is created from the traffic and dried out cow dung that I have to say doesn’t make most of the streets in Varanasi comfortable to walk around.

Once you have left the clouds of poo particles, you eventually come upon a path running alongside the Holy Ganges River where one of the first Ghats you see is that of Assi Ghat. Now I had been reading about the on goings around these waterways and you often read of the rubbish and pollution, but
Manikarmika Ghat the main Burning Ghat
luckily for us the prime minister had visited a few days ago so in a matter of hours India was sparkling clean by Indian standards anyway. The Ganges almost looked clean enough to swim in. Do not do this. You can read on google about how over 200 untreated open sewers run into the river all day every day. The levels of faecal coliform bacteria found are 35 times the maximum permissible figure set by the National River Conservation Directorate, which is 175 times the desirable level and 440 times the maximum level recommended for swimming in the US before water is treated. You never want to get a mouth full of this…. GLUG GLUG!!

The difference between walking through the streets to walking alongside the river is the calmness you can feel whilst at the water’s edge. This felt unbelievable in India. Near Assi Ghat where the Assi River meets the Ganges, Beneath a Peepul tree, you will see Pilgrims here to worship a Shiva Lingam, which is a Phallic image of Shiva. Worshipers and tourists will sit here all day and night to see the changes from the hot, but quiet calm of the day to the
beating the rags dry
hustle and bustle of hawkers, and pedlars at night gathering all across the massive concrete area that lays before the river and at the foot of Assi Ghat. Over our six days we began to really like this area of the river. Just out of the dust and just before the relentless boat offerings.

Further North you quickly see the day to day activities of Varanasi locals and amongst them you will see beautifully dressed women and half nude men all washing themselves and the households laundry in the heavily polluted river. The ceremony of washing the body is as basic as it is in the shower. Get wet, lather up and wash it off, but bathers of the Ganges are not in the shower. They get wet?! (yes) They lather up?! (yes) They also add three dips, fully submerged under the water followed by a big swig and spit of the unbelievably tasty water. Did you read the figures of faecal coliform?????? Uuuuuuurgh!! You can see people washing Laundry near piles of collected rubbish and even further north, the river holds a completely different type of pollution.

Harishchandra Ghat which is a cremation ghat, is smaller than
weighing the wood for sale. Burning Ghats
that of Manikarnika but is one of the oldest ghats in Varanasi. The main burning ghat, Manikarnika is the most auspicious place for a Hindu to be cremated. Dead bodies are handled by outcasts known as doms, and are carried through the alleyways of the old city to the holy Ganges on a bamboo stretcher swathed in cloth. If you sit in a lonely planet recommended stall, Blue Lassi, which has the ‘Best lassi in all Varanasi’, whilst you are slurping on the refreshing goodness you will see the beginnings of the ceremony pass you by at a rate of about 3 every 20 minutes. On arrival at the river’s edge the corpse is doused in the Ganges prior to cremation. Huge piles of firewood are stacked along the top of the ghat; every log is carefully weighed on giant scales so that the price of cremation can be calculated. Each type of wood has its own price, sandalwood being the most expensive. There is an art to using just enough wood to completely incinerate a corpse. You can watch cremations but always show reverence by behaving respectfully. Photography is strictly prohibited though if you ask the owner of the
three posers.... but the day must go on!
ghat, as a tourist of course, there is a fee you can pay to take as many pictures as you like. I took 2 from a distance and for free. I couldn’t bare the corruptness anymore. In my book you either can or you can’t!! The strangest thing about witnessing the cremations is after the first bonfire you pass, that has a leg sticking out of the end swelling due to the heat you find yourself becoming numb to the experience. Once The Body has been fully cremated any remains are then wrapped in cloth and cast into the river. The real sad thing is some families cannot afford the wood for the cremation so instead of Burning the body, the body is weighted down and sunk to the bed of the river. Frighteningly funny, a taxi driver, that I asked if he swims in the river, explained that four years prior to the now he used to swim but he had a very unfortunate incident. In an Indian accent the whole story was shocking but hilarious. As he did every day he would go down to the river for his bathing ceremony. Dip dip dip, glug glug spit, then
water buffalo.. looking for nosh
he would add a running dive and swim for his daily exercise. You have all seen signs at swimming spots for submerged rocks hahaha… the poor bastard dived in and got caught by a dead body and on realising what it was, he flew from the water in shock and ended up in hospital for four days. When he came out of his trance he vowed never to swim in the river again. Over the next few days I would pass without as much as a raise of my hand to shield me from the heat whilst eating a mars bar or drinking a coke. The first time all you can see is the burning body. But on the 2nd and 3rd you begin to notice how the locals are conducting themselves. I wish I could have took the picture but in a single frame I was watching a Bollywood movie in a shed with a couple of hysterical Indian men and to the left, a Dom thwacking the knee joint of a body with a bamboo pole to break the leg so he could flick the remains into the fire. Absolute madness.

Whilst In Varanasi I turned 33
is that peace or piss off?
and to celebrate it I chose to not swim in the river and opt for some westernised Varanasi food. For breakfast we ate at a restaurant called open Hand which is a set up that employs people in need that ranges from the homeless to victims of Aids in an attempt to normalise a small part of their lives. They sell great garments and souvenirs but most importantly they sell a great club sandwich. After this I walked around to a chai stall named Kashi Café, where the daily service from Lakhan is perfect. In the picture of him and I it is a little unclear whether he is saying peace or piss off!! Either way the chai here was awesome. For the week I reckon I had 30 cups easy. Ask for the 10 rupee cup instead of the 7. Its worth it!! For early lunch on my birthday and for breakfast the following day we ate at Aums Café located in the alleyway just behind Assi Ghat. If you are in Varanasi be sure to visit Aum as she has a lot to say about the Indian way of life in this sacred city. You will be well
wonky architecture
informed for sure.

The week flew by in Varanasi and we only had a few days left before we would leave India. We decided to take a train and pay a little more for an aircon express from a station a little way out of town to Kolkatta where we took night to rest in a basic room before saying goodbye to our mates Joe and Annie. After a flight to Bangkok, a three hour wait on KohSan rd, a 9 hour train and a two hour boat we arrived on Koh tao where we would collect our bags that we left. After a nice few days of relaxing with great mates on one of my favourite islands in the world we would board another boat, take a bus, jump two flights and after 24 hours of travel land back in Australia.

I am currently trying to find Work in Byron Bay but will be heading up to Cairns for the Christmas time to help out on my old boat with Sunlover Reef Cruises (if you are in Cairns and you want me to take you for a dive come say hi). Look out for the next blogs
Fantastic wall art
but please be patient as they may be fewer and farther between. I really hope you have enjoyed this last trip over the last 10 or so blogs. Thank you to all of the new readers and if you need any help or advice or just want to keep in touch search Niki Maguire on Facebook and I will happily message you back. If any of you know of any work in Byron bay that is outdoorsy and cool, to fit in with the lifestyle here please let me know. You will be rewarded with drinks of your choice (within reason) and a very helpful friend.

Love to everybody at home

Varanasi (वाराणसी) (Hindustani pronunciation: ( listen)), also known as بنارس, Benares, Banaras (Banāras ( listen)) or Kashi (Kāśī ( listen)), is an Indian city on the banks of the Ganga in Uttar Pradesh, 320 kilometres (200 mi) south-east of the state capital, Lucknow. It is the holiest of the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism, and Jainism, and played an important role in the development of Buddhism. Some Hindus believe that death at Varanasi brings salvation. It is one
Ganges... no swimming for me.
of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Varanasi is also known as the favourite city of the Hindu deity Lord Shiva as it has been mentioned in the Rigveda that this city in older times was known as Kashi or ""Shiv ki Nagri"".

The Kashi Naresh (Maharaja of Kashi) is the chief cultural patron of Varanasi, and an essential part of all religious celebrations.The culture of Varanasi is closely associated with the Ganges. The city has been a cultural centre of North India for several thousand years, and has a history that is older than most of the major world religions. The Benares Gharana form of Hindustani classical music was developed in Varanasi, and many prominent Indian philosophers, poets, writers, and musicians live or have lived in Varanasi. Gautama Buddha gave his first sermon at Sarnath, located near Varanasi.



Varanasi is the spiritual capital of India. It is often referred to as ""the holy city of India"", ""the religious capital of India"", ""the city of Shiva"", and ""the city of learning"". Scholarly books have been written in the city, including the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas. Today, there is a temple of his namesake in the city, the Tulsi Manas Mandir. The current temples and religious institutions in the city are

Varanasi: Mythical,traditional, chaotic and vibrant



Traveler at heart... Love to soak in the culture .... not just do the touristy things... see the city as a living entity and meet the people that add to the character ...



I will try to share relevant links, key events and things to shop, eat and watch out for. I hope you like it.. more importantly it is of some use to some one...



1. Websites:



a. Uttar Pradesh tourism:<span> click here

Even though its not the most dynamic or responsive page. It does cover a lot and is a credible source of information. specially if you are not from India.



b. Lonely planet:<span> click here

Typical lonely planet page. Covers the basics for an international visitor. Native people might find it a bit touristy but its apt for the target audience.



c. Tripadvisor (hotels):<span> click here

Now when you are looking for hotels, things to keep in mind are that the buzz of the city is in and around the Vishwanath temple. Closer you are to Godowlia the better. shopping, food and sightseeing are convenient from here. The major problem is that in this area cars are not allowed so you have to leave your cab and take a cycle rickshaw. Good hotels are few and rare. I have stayed at the Lara hotel because of its location and its safe. Amenities wise its good for what they are charging you.






2. Connectivity:



a. Rail: Though Varanasi has its very own railway station, number of reputed trains dont go there so the next best thing is Mughal Sarai. Its about 20 odd kms and it takes between Rs. 500 - 700 to hire a small car.



b. Air: Varanasi airport is again 20 odd km from the city but the air fares swing pretty dramatically so please book in advance.



c. Road: Connectivity via road is improving but its not great I would not advise road travel from long distances.



d. In city travel: Best option is autos, they will charge you what comes to their mind so do haggle. If ypu are planning to travel to Chunar, Sarnath and Windam falls take a private car. Prefer hotel cars as they will ensure cleanliness and safety.







3. Food:




Varanasi is confluence of flavors. Here Indian vegetarian cuisine takes you on a journey that you will remember. Let me list down a few must haves:



a. Sweets from Vishwanath gali – Lal peda, Kheer mohan, Bharwa parwal, Mal pua, Meetha sandwich and Ras kadam



b. Shakes and Thandai (Milk based herb sherbet) from Gowdolia Chowk



c. Choti Kachori and Jalebi from Chowk Kotwali



d. Malaiye, Kulfi, Aloo ki tikki, Gol gappe, Dal ke pakode and Pan…. Your trip is incomplete without the traditional meetha (sweet) beetle nut concoction.



e. Mouth fresheners from Vishwanath gali – Numerous of varieties from dried herbs to prepackaged beetle nuts.



f. Pickles and Papads from Dashashwamedh ghat – some of most intriguing and mouthwatering varieties of pickles are available there.







4. Shopping:




Varanasi is a shopper’s paradise from garments to artifacts you have a massive range to choose from. Some must see items are listed below:


















a. Stone sculptures and carvings: From Hindu gods and goddesses to ash trays the choice is amazing. Also you will get different kinds of stones like marble, soap stone and sandstone. Sandstone is the regional specialty the amazing thing about sandstone is that once you wash it with water it keeps your room fragrant with smell of wet earth. (mitti ki sondhi khusboo). Available near and in Vishwanath gali.


























b. Wooden art and craft: It’s am art which has seen a

revival in modern times. These traditional toys and sculptures come in vibrant colors and they are completely washable and last for years. Available in Vishwanath Gali













c. Sarees and fabrics: Even though Varanasi is known for this. This is a high risk item as you can’t be assured of the quality. So try and purchase from large showrooms.



















5. Sightseeing:




Varanasi will provide with a range of options and it all depends on what turns you on. If it’s the authentic hustle bustle of the old town or the calm soothing feel of the river. Again let me try and list a few things I like.



a. Boat ride and the 80 ghats: Now this is a two time activity once in the day and the second time in the evening. By now you must have realized Banarasi’s are smooth talkers so am I lol. But you need to be careful when you fix a boat. Firstly if it’s a row boat you need atleast 2 oarsman and if it’s a jet boat then also. It helps to coordinate the ride. Secondly Varanasi has 80 ghats (Assi ghaat) so they would try and show you between 15 – 25 push them to go further. Thirdly it’s a photographers paradise so a camera is a must. Also carry a bottle of water as you might need one if it’s a sunny day.



b. Temples of Varanasi







i. Kashi Vishwanath Temple: Varanasi is Shiva’s abode on flat lands. It’s an experience to visit the temple. Mobile phones and liquids are not allowed so either leave it in your hotel or deposit with the guy who keeps your shoes. For international ttravelers in India almost 99%!t(MISSING)emples don’t allow shoes. You need to deposit your shoes and bags with shops near the temple gate and you can collect them on your way back. In case of any doubts please talk to policemen they are your best source of information around the temple complex.




ii. Sankat Mochan Temple: Hanuman ji Temple with hundreds of langoors around. So please go in empty handed. It’s a simple temple where people have been worshipping for thousands of years.




iii. Tulsi Manas Mandir: Is an experience worth having for the first timer. The temple depicts scenes from hindu mythology and would specially be of interest for kids and international travellers.




iv. Varanasi has more than 1000 temples so I am sure there are many more so I am not going to list them all. A piece of advice there are numerous shady characters around so be careful do not carry cards or cash more than a few hundred bucks. In case you have expensive mobile phones please avoid carrying them. Same goes for DSLR.






<table class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""padding: 6px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; float: left; margin-right: 1em;"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;"">

</td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""font-size: 13px; padding-top: 4px; text-align: center;"">
Gangaji ki Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat
</td></tr></tbody></table>


c. Gangaji ki Aarti (Even prayers at the river ghat): Must see if its your first time in Varanasi. Do check the timing with your hotel and the closest ghat. It takes about 45 mins but it’s worth the time. Due to tourist interest they have now choreographed it.


























<table class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""padding: 6px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;"">

</td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""font-size: 13px; padding-top: 4px; text-align: center;"">
Sarnath
</td></tr></tbody></table>
d. Sarnath: Barely an hour from Varanasi this is a town rich in Buddhist history. It has an ancient and historical stupa. It has 2 beautiful monasteries. The modern temple is beautiful and serene. You will specially enjoy the evening prayer.






e. Windham falls: Lovely site after monsoons just be a careful there are loads of leeches around.



f. Chunar: Once the center of sandstone art and craft its now a town devoted to creating ceramics. There is an old fort not very well maintained but in case you are into that you might consider visiting it.




Best time to visit is autumn and spring. Try and avoid major Indian religious festivals specially he ones linked to Shiva. Also if you can manage the chaos then Dev Deepawali in November is a spectacular scene.



I have been travelling to various places and I have been blessed to be guided by some really caring and warm souls. So I thought does everyone have access to such a credible knowledge base ???

In all probability no - right... So it is time for me to give back...



What better to kick start my travel blog than my ancestral town 😊






I will keep updating my post as and when new experiences happen. Everyone is free to add to this.

I'll start briefly in Varanasi, so I thought I'll get back to the hotel two hours before the train so I can pack and chill before a 13 hour train journey. First off some kid leads me miles away taking me to a tuk tuk stand, then the fucking driver doesn't know where my hotel is! What kind of tuk tuk driver doesn't know where things are in the city?! Dickhead!
So we're driving around for like an hour, at this point I'm thinking in going to miss the train.
I get to the station with five minutes to find the platform and train, which in India is one of the hardest things, especially at Varanasi train station, there's fuck all in English and no one who speaks English, nightmare.
I manage to just about find the platform and catch the train just in time because it's late.
I've paid 900rs for the ticket at the travel agents, expecting to have my own bed like the last journey, turns out I'm in the bottom class, and sharing a seat with five people, another fucking Varanasi scam!
Eventually the train empties some and I have the bed to myself, so I go to sleep and am awoken at 3AM by a man who's been happily sat somewhere else for the rest of the journey, but now decides he wants to sit in his seat, he had a ticket for it to be fair, but it's bullshit that I even ended up in that carriage! Diwali travelling I suppose.

I decide that as there isn't much to do in Agra from what I've been told and read other than the Taj and the fort, so I book a ticket out of there to Delhi upon arrival.
You can leave your bag in Agra cantt station all day for 20rs, so I don't have to carry my huge rucksack around, class.
I get a tuk tuk to the taj, I paid 500rs for the guy to take me to the taj and wait, then the fort and wait and take me to a restaurant, and again wait then take me to the station.
I arrive at the Taj, 750rs entry, 20rs for SAARCS (people from India, Nepal, Shri Lanka, Bhutan and a couple of others), it's fucking annoying, but in the same respect it's still only £7.50 to see one of the wonders of the world, same thing back home would be like £50!
My glimpse of the Taj and I'm literally staring open mouthed at the cunt, it's fucking amazing, it doesn't look like it's actually there, I think it was built that way, part of the illusion. The gardens surrounding it are really nice and clean, unlike a lot of temples etc in India. I'd been told the Taj was just an empty building, but I wasn't prepared for how empty it actually is, just a cenotaph in the centre, apparently lined up exactly with the coffin of the girl it was built for, who died giving birth to her fucking 14th child! Mental.
It was a lot smaller inside than I ever though it would be, I always assumed there'd be loads of different rooms and stuff, but it's just one big empty room, with beautiful carvings engraved in the marble. It's fucking amazing and I didn't feel remotely let down, unlike some of the things I've seen on this trip!

Next off to Agra fort, according to the guide book a poor man's version of the red fort in Delhi. According to everyone I met who'd been to both, it's the other way around and you can't even go in the buildings at red fort, I think I'll give that one a miss!
It would have been so much better if you walk around the walls of the fort, like you can in Chester and York, but ah well, some cool engravings in the walls of some of the buildings and an amazing view of the Taj, which literally looks way more impressive from a distance, and weirdly looks bigger the further away you are from it, apparently another intentional design, it's fucking class!

Now off the Delhi for two nights, I need a day off, India is tiring! Get me to Goa!
The train to Delhi was apparently at 4, so I arrive and the board says 5:10, fucking brilliant, stuck waiting for an hour, could be worse, the train could be a few hours late....oh it is. Fuck sake!
I end up getting on the train at around 8 and arriving in Delhi around half 11, luckily I met a polish girl on the platform and Brazilian girl on the train, made the time pass quicker and gave me the confidence I was on the right train etc.

Right, Delhi for the first night of Diwali!

Ganges
Waar rook is zijn lijken
Toen Agastya de oceaan had leeg gedronken, konden de Goden eindelijk de Tormentors doden. De Tormentors verstopten zich namelijk overdag in de oceaan om ‘s avonds mensen af te slachten. De Ganges zou de oceaan weer vullen, maar dat was nogal een eigenwijze meid. Dus had Shiva de Ganges in zijn haren gevangen zodat ze eens normaal zou doen. Vanaf toen was de Ganges (volgens de Hindu's) een heilige rivier.

Wij flaneren graag langs de rivier. En als het 35 graden is en die motoren, auto's en rickshaws toeteren constant in je oren, is het fijn om een briesje mee te paken van de heilige rivier. ""Heilig"" in India betekent de plek om alles wat vies is erin te gooien, inclusief jezelf om je zonden weg te wassen. Ons flaneergangetje bestond dus uit het balanceren door modderpoeljes vol met alle soorten afval (met als dieptepunt Edward op zijn snufferd in de heilige modder, helaas geen foto's beschikbaar) en adem inhouden als we door de rook lopen. De rook is afkomstig van doden. De Ganges werkt als een lift naar de hemel.
De lijken worden in de open lucht gecremeerd. Misschien kun je je voorstellen, een
lijk op een houtvuurtje, dat verast niet in 30 minuten. Gevolg: onfraaie beelden en menselijke resten die in de rivier worden gedropt. Inderdaad 100 meter van waar je je rituele ochtendbadje aan het nemen bent. Nou schijnen verbrande menselijke resten niet schadelijk te zijn voor de gezondheid. In tegenstelling tot slachtafval, wasmiddel, riolering en afvalstoffen van de fabrieken. Deze heilige rivier is een cocktail van gifstoffen met als gevolg een geweldige kater in de vorm van cholera en diaree, doodsoorzaak nummer 2 in India. Om nog maar te zwijgen van de talloze diersoorten die hier uitsterven. Ondanks de hitte wachten wij nog even met een bad te nemen, wij nemen de Rijn wel, desnoods de Amstel.
Als het gaat zoals plan snellen we morgen met de trein naar de grens van Nepal.

Wo Rauch ist sind Leichen
Nachdem Agastya den Ozean ausgetrunken hat, konnten die Göter endlich die Tormentoren töten. Die Tormentoren versteckten sich am Tag im Ozean um am Abend Menschen ab zu schlachten. Ganges sollte den Ozean wieder auffüllen, aber sie war eine eigensinnige Frau. Darum hat Shiva sie in seinen Haaren gefangen damit sie sich seinen Wünschen entsprechend verhält. Von diesem Moment an wurde Ganges zu
einem heilige Fluss (für die Hindus).

Wir flanieren gerne am Fluss entlang. Bei 35 °C, und mit konstantem Gehup von Motorrädern, Autos und Rickshaws in den Ohren, ist es angenehm weg vom Lärm, eine Brise vom Heiligen Fluss auf der Haut zu fühlen. ""Heilig"" in India, heisst dass man alles was dreckig ist rein werfen kann, inklusive sich selber, damit man die Sünden weg spühlen kann. Anstatt gemütlich zu spazieren, müssen wir vor allem durch Schlammpfützen aus unterschiedlichstem Abfall balancieren (der Tiefpunkt war, als Edward in den heiligen Schlamm gefallen ist, wir haben leider keine Fotos).

Die Inder scheinen sich am Dreck nicht zu stoeren. Am einen Steg werden Kleider gewaschen, am anderen wird gebadet, weiter vorne werden Ceremonien gehalten um den Fluss zu preisen. Zwar hupt hier niemand, jedoch ruft man uns alle paar Meter:"" Hello, Boat?"" zu. Das ganze Schauspiel kann naemlich vom Boot aus mit vielen anderen Touristen betrachtet werden. Wir sagen ""No, No, NOOO"" und gehen weiter. Weiter vorne steigt uns ein giftiger Rauch in die Nase. Wir passieren die Stelle an der taeglich Leichen kremiert werden. Diese werden auf einem Feuer Nahe beim Fluss verbrannt und die überreste ins Wasser geworfen. Menschen- tot
toeteren/hupen
oder lebendig- kommen von weit um an diesem heiligen Ort kremiert zu werden um die Seele vom ewigen Kreis der Wiedergeburt zu befreien.Das ist jedoch nicht unser Ziel, wenn alles gut geht, nehmen wir morgen früh den Zug Richtung Nepal.
Heute wird jedoch noch gefeiert, die Hindus feiern heute das Fest Divali. Mit Geschenken, Feuerwerk und Frauenfuerze ist es fuer uns wie Weihnachten, Sylvester und Fasnacht zusammen, und das im Oktober bei 35 Grad.
Happy Divali!

20141021_113354
Having left Pokhara and crossed the border into India and arrived at Gorakhpur (that's probably not how it's spelt), I met an old Swedish guy on the bus who was also travelling to Varanasi, he's been in India for 32 years so I stuck with him and he got the train tickets sorted, second class sleeper, you get your own bed with a softer mattress than some of the ones on the trek!
This is easily the best way to travel anywhere by train, fall asleep in one city, wake up in another, and you don't even have to pay for accommodation.

So arrive in Varanasi, and I've been told it's the worst place in India for scammers and people trying to take your money etc...so I've got my wits about me, or so I think.
I sort out a tuk-tuk (like a taxi, with 3 wheels, also known as a rickshaw) to ""yogi lodge"" recommended in the guide book, the guide book also says there's a few with similar names that pay commission to tuk-tuk drivers for taking people there instead of the real place, one of these happens to be called ""old yogi lodge"", which is where I fucking ended up! I didn't even realise I was in the wrong one until I walked past the real one! Fuck sake! SCAMMED already, ah well fuck it.
The rooms pretty clean, I have my own toilet and a fan that works, can't complain.
When I go downstairs the owner is having a chat with me, explaining that everyone outside the walls of the hotel are crooks and liars, great start, it must be bad if I'm getting warned of it by an Indian.

Anyway, I set off towards the ghats (meaning steps) which is where people descend down to the Ganges to fucking ""wash"", I say it in quotation marks because washing isn't something that can be done in this ""water"", it's full of that much shite from dead bodies in the middle to chemicals from factories further upstream. Genuinely wouldn't be surprised if the chemical makeup isn't even the same as water, it can't be fucking water, it's fucking grim and stinks!
I didn't want to get a boat up the river to view the ghats from the water because I was convinced the boat would corrode as we
sailed down the river!

So really the Ghats start at the ""burning ghat"", this is the main place for bodies getting cremated, I'm told that depending on caste (the hierarchy of Indian people, basically just a system so say who's better than who, very fucked up, younger people tend to be ignoring it more and more though), how much money you have and a few other circumstances depends if you get burned high up (for the richer, higher castes) or next to the river (for the lower castes) and if you can't afford for the body to be burned or have no family/friends then they take the bodies to middle of the Ganges, tie rocks to it and just sink it. The very thought that at the bottom of the water are loads of corpses, I imagine ominously bobbing about, is fucking disgusting!
If that's what Hindus have to do to prevent theirselves being reincarnated then I think I'd rather live forever! It's so dirty. The whole of Varanasi in general is pretty dirty and smelly. There's certain sections of ghats that fucking absolutely stink, it may seem like I unnecessarily swear a lot, but believe me, it smells that fucking bad it warrants swearing.
Literally they could rename the city to ""fuckinggrim"" all one word of course.
I knew there wasn't much to do in Varanasi aside from the ghats and I'm glad to be leaving. I was walking around with an uneasy feeling the whole time, I don't know if it was just the stories getting me or just the general vibe. But I can say with much certainty that I won't be returning at any point in the future, it was worth the visit, but it's just creepy. You're stood outside a shop on a tiny street, next thing a dead body is being carried past you, or people bathing in water I wouldn't go within 10M of in fear of getting a splash on me!
All that said, I must have met the nicest man in Varanasi!
The guy saved me from what could have ended up bad, he then took me round the city for two days on his bike showing me around, taking me to his shop, in which I kind of felt inclined to buy a lungi (a piece of material you wrap around yourself like a towel when you're out the shower), although it's a class lungi and I wanted another anyway. The whole time i was very dubious, awaiting the moment when I thought he'd inevitably ask for something, but surprisingly that moment didn't come! Fuck yeah! He also inspired the title of this blog, he kept bumping into people on his motorbike to make them move, then laughing and saying ""haha this is Varanasi, no rules""
Goes to show, even in the scummiest, trickiest place in the world there's some good.

Right, fuck Varanasi, it's a shithole, thank fuck I'm on my way out!
Off to Agra and the mighty Taj!

Wat kosten de bananen?

Tien dagen verder in India en we weten nog steeds niet zeker wat een banaan kost. Bananen zijn geel, gezond en nog een belangrijke eigenschap, ze werken stoppend -de Indische curry's zijn heerlijk, maar ze hebben bij mij de eigenschap om na het verteringsproces met een rotgang weer naar buiten te gaan-.



Terwijl het Nederlandse BBP per capita op rond $ 50 000 ligt en het Zwitserse rond $ 81 000 ligt dat van India op $ 1509*. De Indiers kennen de getallen dan wel niet, ze weten wel dat wij meer te besteden hebben. Dat leidt tot het standaard afdingtheater bij zo ongeveer iedere stap die we zetten.



Maar probeer eens af te dingen op een banaan. Als je dat doet, krijg je de volle laag. ""Wat denk je wel niet! Dat ik je probeer te besodemieteren? Een Indier betaalt ook 5 rupee (ongeveer 6 eurocent) voor een banaan! Je hoeft geen banaan te kopen!"" (Ten minsten, ik denk dat ze dat zeggen). Het was natuurlijk niet onze intentie de verkoper te beledigen, of zijn waar af te keuren, dus op basis van ons geweten kopen we dan toch
weer vier bananen.Toch knaagt er een gevoel, als de verkoper boos maar gretig naar het geld kijkt. Zeker niet als al die Indiers (want het maakt niet uit wat we doen er staan er altijd minimaal 5 om ons heen) met grote ogen en een besmuikt lachje naar de transactie kijken..Misschien moeten het ze ook maar gunnen.



Verder nog wat willekeurige foto's van de afgelopen dagen.



Was kosten die Bananen?

Nach 10 Tagen in Indien zu sein, wissen wir noch immer nicht was eine Banane kostet. Abgesehen davon, dass Bananen gelb und gesund sind, haben sie noch eine Eigenschaft, sie stopfen... Die indischen Curries sind herrlich aber gehen bei mir wie der Blitz wieder raus.



Das Holländische Brutoinlandprokukt pro Kopf ist ungefähr $ 50 000, das Schweizerische $ 81 000 und das von Indien $ 1509*. Obwohl die Inder die Zahlen nicht kennen, wissen sie schon, dass wir mehr Geld aus zu geben haben und am liebsten nehmen sie das in die eigene Tasche. Das heisst, es gibt immer ein Standard Theaterspiel bei fast jedem Schritt den wir setzen.



Aber versuch mal bei einer Bananezu verhandeln. Macht
man das, wird der Verkaeufer wütend. ""Was meinst du eigentlich? Ich versuche dich zu verarschen? Ein Inder bezahlt auch 5 Rupee pro Banane (ungefehr 9 Rappen). Dann kaufst du halt keine Banane!"" Es war natürlich nicht unser Ziel den Verkaeufer zu beleidigen, oder seine Sachen abzuwerten. Aufgrund unseres Gewissens kaufen wir trotzdem 4 Bananen für 20 Rupee. Und doch bekommen wir ein komisches Gefuehl, wenn der Verkaeufer verärgert aber begierig das Geld anschaut. Sicher nicht wenn all die anderen Inder (es ist egal was wir machen, es gibt immer mindestens 5 um uns herum, die mit einem heimlichen Lächeln die Transaktion anschauen)... Vielleicht müssen wir es ihnen einfach gönnen.



Weiter noch ein paar willkürliche Fotos von den letzten Tagen.

The Taj Mahal in the flesh
Ok so its been quite some time since I wrote a blog... and I am finally back on track and ready to start writing again.. ALOT has happened since my last blog but I will get to that in good time!



We arrived in Agra to a man holding a sign with my name on it... We were staying at Aman Homestay and they had sent a driver for us. When we arrived at Aman, the family were still sleeping, but all got out of bed sleepily to greet us and make us some beautiful Chai. Once we settled into our rooms (which were really lovely) we showered then decided to head out for breakfast. The homestay arranged a tuktuk for us for the day and our driver was waiting for us. His name was Vicky and he looked like Super Mario. He was extremely happy and quite funny and he drove like a maniac! He told us on the way to breakfast that to drive in India you need three things ""a good horn, good brakes and good luck"" lol



We had breakfast at a dodgy rooftop cafe that Vicky recommended us go to.
Sari Beauty
It did have views to the Taj Mahal... and when I saw it for the first time it was kind of surreal... but the food left alot to be desired and we were quickly wishing we had gone to one in the Lonely Planet nearby! Lesson learnt about going where your tuktuk driver recommends! Vicky then took us to Agra Fort and we wandered around for an hour or so. We decided not to get a tour guide or the audio tour and halfway through we did regret it. There was obviously alot of history to the Fort and we did not get the full experience by just walking around. TIP: don't be a scab... pay for a tour guide!



Taylor was not feeling well so we went back to the guesthouse and while she lay down, Brandon and I decided to head to find a gym. We headed off to the fancy Raddisson hotel nearby who had said we could use the gym. A lady escorted us through the hotel (we felt very out of place in our gym gear) and showed us this amazing gym, and then when we asked the price she then decided
Just hanging in the Red Fort
to tell us that outside guests were unable to use it! WTF... could have told us that before you showed us! lol.



We then asked our tuktuk driver Vicky for a gym and he took us to the most dodgy looking hotel in the middle of nowhere... We were led up to a gym and had to laugh. It was so old school but there was HEAPS of equipment and they charged us a paltry $1 to use it! LOVED it! After we had a gym session we went to have lunch at a restaurant recommended in the Lonely Planet... The food was awesome.. We had Dosa's which are a south indian cuisine, washed down with icecream sundaes which were to die for. Afterwards we headed back to the hotel and when we got there, Taylor was now hungry. Brandon went to lay down for a nap and I took Taylor back to the same restaurant as I couldnt stop raving about the food! I ended up eating another two icecream sundaes while Taylor had her main meal! Oh well, I am on holidays after all!



We went to the back area of the
Yep I am really there!
Taj Mahal for sunset. Its a small area close to the Taj that you can view the Taj Mahal against the backdrop of a sunset and popular with tourists and locals alike. We took some photos of the Taj. A few of the local boys decided to become fixated on beautiful Taylor and in the end I had to tell them I was her mother and to leave her alone! LOL



We had dinner that night at our guesthouse with a group of other guests that were staying there. It was all homecooked by the family that run the homestay and the food was beautiful and authentic. We retired to our rooms after dinner and had an early night as we were getting up early for sunrise at the Taj!



The next morning we accidentally slept in and missed the sunrise at the Taj! Can you believe it! lol One chance and we missed it! Oh well! Taylor and I were both feeling the pressure and reality of India and while it wasn't a fight, we did have a little niggle at each other and went our seperate way for the morning! Both of
Red Fort
us had been in each others pocket for the past week and I think we just needed our own space for a bit. Taylor headed off to the Taj Mahal with some of the other guests and after a good cry and feeling rather homesick, I headed to the Taj Mahal with Brandon. We wandered around the Taj Mahal for awhile snapping lots of photos. It was extremely beautiful and quite overwhelming.



Afterwards we headed back to the guesthouse for breakfast and then I spent the day chilling in the garden of the guesthouse catching up on my blogs and doing some reading. Brandon went off to do some more sightseeing since we had a car booked for the day. Taylor turned up before lunch and after a quick hug we headed off to have some lunch. We ended up at a little place called Pinch of Spice which was a little pricer than normal but high class and the food amazing! We washed lunch down with a couple of cocktails and ended up dragging Brandon back there that night for dinner it was that good!



The following morning we said a sad goodbye
When in India....waiting at the Railway station for the train
to the beautiful Ranjana and her family before heading off to catch a train to Delhi.... it was a short but lovely stay at Aman Homestay and Agra. Next stop : Delhi

Agra Fort
Geo: 26.9847, 78.1019

Up and out of the hotel by 5 am to catch the train to Agra. It was a nice, fast train for the 2 hour trip. We arrived and headed off to Agra Fort. We had a guided tour of the fort and and it was very interesting. From the fort we had our first glimpse of the Taj Mahal. Beautiful even from that distance.
We then visited a carpet place that made handmade carpets. The average carpet takes six months to make depending on the size. It was interesting to see how they are made and all the pretty designs. We then headed off to our hotel to relax before heading out to see the Taj Mahal. It was breath taking to see the Taj Mahal as it is more beautiful than we ever expected it to be. It was a dream come true to see it and spend time in such a beautiful setting.
We returned to the hotel to change for dinner and then took a tuk-tuk to a nearby restaurant.

Day19 - An easy morning in Varanasi, visit to the silk house, and an overnight train to Delhi
What a pleasure! A nice easy morning today. We got up at about 9am. Kyla visited our room. I ordered coffee from room service for the three if us. We relaxed and chatted, and caught up amount last nights meal as both Kyla and Judy didn't go due to not feeling well enough!
We all set too, packing our bags as we are moving back to Delhi on an overnight train later tonight.
Once we were packed, and our room checked over for items missed, off we went for breakfast.
We were going to go to the, Bread of Life Cafe, but as we were moving at a slow pace, we ended up with very little time. Therefore we had breakfast in our hotel.
At about 12ish we set off in tuk tuks to see the silk weavers, and visit the silk house. This was my moment to buy my sari. I have decided it would be nice to wear a sari for the next school prom!
The noise made by the looms was really loud. We were shown how the patterns are
image
ranger red from paper to the loom. We also watched the silk being hand woven, such a slow, difficult job. No wonder silk clothing is so expensive. It is clearly a very labour intensive, artful job!
I did manage to get my sari. It is in orange, red and gold. I had lessons on how to put it on! Jude and Kyla also tried sarees on; they looked stunning!
We returned to the hotel by 4.30 so that we had time to eat before going for the train. After tea, we went for our last Varanasi natural lassi in the clay pot; got some bits of good for the train.
We arrived at the station at about 5.45. Ankur started to get his,'efficient' head on at about 4.30. You can see him change. This is a good thing, as it gives the group confidence for the next move!

Day 18 - Sunrise on The Ganges and Sarnath

We started with another early start. We set off at 4.45 for another boat trip on The Ganges, this time to experience the sunset. Again we were not disappointed; it was cloudy, but Emily and I managed to catch a few great photos just over a few minutes whilst it burst through a break in the clouds. The emotion was different for me today; I felt completely calm, and at piece with myself.
After the boat journey, some people went back to the hotel; Tom, Emily, Abi, Kyla, Ankur and I went to a local cafe for breakfast. I thoroughly enjoyed it! Yes, it is all about the food!
On returning to the hotel, Tom, Kyla, Ankur and I had a lazy beer morning on the rooftop. We continued to discuss both life, and personal issues, achievements and general thoughts, opinions and experiences. I enjoy sharing these times with open, like minded people. I gave in at about 11am for a nap.
In the afternoon we went by tuk tuk to the ruins of nearby Sarnath, the site of the Buddha's first sermon, and the museum. It was quite a long
image
ride, bit really interesting insight to everyday life for many people on India, along the way.
I returned early with Jude, as she was feeling a bit sickly. Liz, Patrick and I went over the road to the local Lassi stall....really nice! .... If you can forgive the many flies that are present! It is served in a clay pot that you throw away when finished.
Tonight we are going with Ankur to eat at a Tibetan, family run restaurant. Numbers are slightly down due to few tender stomaches. Another east night was had by all that attended. Tomorrow is rare occasion...... A sleep in, but I bet I can't sleep in!
Jude and I are packed and ready to move again. We had a surprise visit from a 'cake bearing' Patrick:... I was joking around with him about stealing my piece of birthday cake! Bless him, and thank you, your sincere apologies are accepted xx

Day -17 The overnight train to Varanasi
I closed the blog early last night as we were preparing for leaving Agra, and I didn't see any opportunity to add to the blog ! When in fact, 8 of us went out for a really good meal. It wasn't a particularly sparkling place, just nice food, and good company. We took the alternative route of ordering various dishes, rices and naans, then everyone swapping, passing and tasting foods; then just simply split the bill. We all enjoyed it this way, but it can only work if everyone is in agreement, that is so much easier with eight people than with 16!
We set off at 10'O clock in a minibus to Agra Station or Tundla Station (about 25 kms from Agra) for overnight train to Varanasi. Ankur warned us of the potential risks on this train, therefore we all had to be careful with out possessions! One of the strong points on this trip has been Ankur's knowledge and awareness of the locals, their ways, and ours! This s potentially a 13 hour journey.
The train journey was fine. No issues. Everyone slept well, except poor Tom, who unfortunately was next to
image
a light and a door; he had any interruptions. He was able to catch up a bit in his sleep between about 7 and 11!
The train managed to arrive with only an hour and a half delay, which is considered really good here!
We arrive at Varanasi, the quintessential Indian holy city where millions of Hindu travel to for pilgrimage, to worship, to mourn or to die.
We settled in, had lunch, then set off in rickshaws to the Ganges. The rickshaw ride in itself was an experience not to be missed; especially 8 rickshaws carrying white Europeans, in succession!
We went down the steps of one of the Ghats to get onto our boat to take to the Ganges. As with the Taj Mahal, I found the whole experience really overwhelming. I just started to cry. Once I had started, I just couldn't stop! Jude and Tom were very similar. I simply can't describe the feelings and emotions that washed over me as we floated by the various Ghats, the ceremonial burning place, even Ankur's explanation talk was do emotional for me. We then went to take part in the flower ceremony watching the monks doing their rituals.
image
Again, for me, this experience is really indescribable!
We ended the night in a lush hotel, eating the best meal yet!, but I do keep saying that!
Just a funny thing happened before bed tonight that I think is worth mentioning, Patrick and I took the lift up to the third floor, first of all it stuck halfway between floors, but then it was followed by a power cut........ All three of just laughed until we were rescued... Lol
The end to another amazing day!

Day 16 - The Taj Majal
This part of the trip is probably the main part of coming to India. I have enjoyed every part of the visit in so many ways, but this is the one !
We set off at 4.45. We had special tickets that got us in at the front. Getting in was epic. This little man kind of caught my attention, beckoning me over. He was walking do fast. He took me through a side door, and got me the most amazing pictures that I could have wished for! One of my needs were to be photographed with no other people I'm sight, so we HAD to be early. I did manage to get that. I have to state, it is breathtaking! I walked around with my mouth open. I can't imagine the love that someone must have for a person to build the mausoleum in their honour...TRULY AMAZING! I got so many perfect pictures that I will treasure! I just can't do it justice on words, or pictures. There is only one way to understand how awesome the Taj is, and that is to see it for yourself! WWWOOOOOOAAAWWWWW!
Jude, with her red hair, lovely
image
eyes and eyeliner, very pale skin.... And of course the pink lips have been getting her celebrity attention.... Today she made.a lasting effect on a young pen seller at the Fort.... Lol
We returned to the holt for a nap,after such an early start. Jude, Kyla and I decided were are all, 'forted' out, so we are bypassing this afternoons trip for a chill out before our night train to Varanasi.

Day 15 - Move to Agra
We were up at 5.10 this morning, as we are catching the train to the Muslim city of Agra. Agra is best known as the site of India's most famous landmark, the Taj Mahal. Yayyy, I am really looking forward to this town, and to actually visit the Taj Mahal; it already feels surreal, and I'm not even there yet!
I woke up quote perky this morning, I think I cheered the rest of the group up with my singing, and bouncy attitude at 5.30! Lol
We set of in our tuk tuks for the final time in Jaipur. It's been another good town, with plenty to offer us tourists!
Ankur put a smile on everyone's face this morning when he informed us that we are going to Agra...on the fast train ..... With air con..... And the best news was saved until last.... With breakfast. Woop woop!
Breakfast was much better than anticipated! I had tea and biscuits followed by cheese omelette with a few bits of veg and two slices of bread. What more could a person ask for? I was totally happy with it. We arrived safely at our next hotel in
image
Agra. I am soooo excited to see the Taj Mahal! After settling in, we went next door to Costa Coffee. Tom, Judy, Kyla, Ankur and I chatted for 2 to three hours outside Costa. We jumped around so many topics of life! I love having those conversations, with so many diverse opinions, including .... Movies, love, marriage, culture, and... choosing a man for me.... Let's face it, I need all the help I can get.... Lol.
We went back to our rooms for a bit of a rest as we had a couple of hours to kill before meeting back as a group. Jude set the alarm to allow for a nap, but we just laid on our beds, relaxing and chatting about Jude's university work, and life in general! The outcome being, we realise that we are both blessed in our lives. I unpacked, and reorganised my backpack, then off to meet for the visit to the 'Baby Taj Mahal', followed by a walk round the back streets of 'The' Taj Majal. I know it was only a sneak preview, but it was still breath taking. I am even more excited for tomorrow! ..... And all of this in
image
the constant pouring rain ...... But it still did not down the experience!
When we returned to the hotel, Jude and I opted for a quiet meal on our own, so we separated from the group and went next door to Pizza Hut. Although we both enjoy the group, It's nice to have a bit of down time. We just regret that we didn't get to tell Kyla, Sorry Kyla!
Really enjoyed our evening meal tonight! The highlight came when all the serving lads started to do a dance sequence, in a line, when a particular song came on. Really novel!
We finished of by having a cappuccino at Costa coffee for our nightcap. I was really pleased that Kyla found us at that point. Another early night, another early morning!

Now many of you may be wondering where is the Ganga river, well that is actually the correct name for the river we know as the Ganges, so,imam reliably informed by our guide Dushyant. Discussing this topic amongst the group we don't know who when where or why the name was changed but in India it is known as the Ganga river, so that is what I will call it from now on.



We were up very early on the day ready for a 4am start! We took the usual crazy tuk tuk ride to a place near the river and got off and walked the rest of the way. The streets were much quieter at that time of the morning, but it was still very warm. There were street vendors still selling there wares, cigarettes, food etc. many selling flower offerings to use at temples and on the river. Of course there were the usual mix of people sleeping in the streets, dogs and cows roaming and crazy drivers beeping horns and people milling around on there way to or from somewhere. Oh and of course it was very warm but not baking hot



The Ganga river is the most holy of rivers in india and many people come to bathe in the waters, pray, give offerings and also fill up plastic containers to take the holy water home to use and keep in their homes. Also many people in India want their bodies to be burned on the banks river and have their ashes put into the river. They believe their souls will be freed and they will spend one year there and then reach nivarna.



We climbed aboard our boat as the sun was rising and there were already loads of people bathing in the river, and people washing clothes. We of course were not the only boat full of tourists watching the goings on around the river so one can only assume it's the done thing when you come to Varanasi to see the sunrise over the river and city.



It was quite a peaceful experience and we saw fish jumping and Dushyant said they even had fresh water dolphins! So may be the water isn't as polluted as we westerners think.



We firstly headed up, the river and along the way we watched the bathers of all ages shapes and sizes bathe and wash in the waters. Some were kids just playing, and families, some just washing as if they were in the bath and many performing a small religious ceremony which purifies them.



We then headed back down stream and in both journeys we witnessed the two places where they cremate the bodies, but we were not allowed to take any photos. Many people come to Varanasi to die so they can be cremated there. Also some people are also brought from other parts of India so they can be cremated as their final wish.



We saw funeral pyres at various stages of the burning process, and also groups of people waiting on the steps with bound and covered bodies adorned with flowers waiting for them to be cremated. In hindu culture only the men take the bodies to be burned and the bodies are covered in yellowy orange covers which is a colour which signifiers freedom. The dead persons soul is now fee of any one or anything and is now with the gods.



The people who cremate the bodies have been doing the job over many years and the skill is passed down from farther to son. It is a very hot job as you not only do they have to deal with the heat from the fires but also the blazing sun, but I'm told it pays well. Each family has to pay for the wood to burn the body and all around the funeral pyres were huge stacks of wood. The wood is then weighed and paid for by the family. If they cannot afford the cremation apparently the community will pay.



So after our journey along the banks of the Ganga river we came back to dry land and headed for breakfast to a local restaurant which seem to have endless flights if stairs to a roof top terrace. It was called the brown bread bakery and 10% of anything we spend is donated to a local school. I had porridge with honey!



Then we headed back to the hotel where I managed to catchup on some of my lost sleep from the crazy night train. (There is a song there - guns and roses lol)



After a lazy day we then headed back out for another crazy tuk tuk ride back down to the river so that some of our party could perform the ceremony mentioned above. You submerge yourself under the water 3 times and then chant and it is supposed to cleans your soul and absolve your sins and make you pure again.

Latoya and i decided to err on the side of caution and not take a dip - thanks to all the folks who responded to my question on the should or shouldn't i take the dip. We took the boat to small sand bank in the middle of the river where it was less crowded and cleaner.

So Dushyant was first in off the boat, closely followed by Chris. Mary and Steph waited until we hit the shore liNd and then paddled in. They had fun splashing around and swimming and then performing the small ritual to cleanse the soul. We took some photos so everyone could remember and those in the water will be able to show the folks back home.

As I'm typing this I have my music playing and take me to the river by the commitments has just come on - spooky!

We headed back to the city side of the shore lime and got off near one of the sites where they cremate the bodies. Ir was really hot but didn't smell,of burning bodies. We were not allowed to take photos of the cremation sire but we could take them from a distance. We did climb the steps of a building above the cremation site and I did take some photos from there bit of the river and surrounding area. We then went up tithe next platform and watched the cremations from above. Then suddenly two guys ran up torus and were very aggressive and accused me of taking photos of the cremation sire which i hadn't. Dushyant spoke to them and said I had been told not to take photos which I hadn't . I had to get my camera out and show them what I had taken photos of. Midis take in a couple of shots from the river but they were distance shots which is what we told them. I apologised if I had offended them. One said what would you say if I slapped you and then said sorry. Dushyant calmed the situation down and I deleted the shots which seemed to offend. Have to say I was shaken by the experience.



Dushyant said there are people who check out what tourists do, to make sure they do not take photos and are paid to make superego photos are not taken. They do make good money but use it to buy drugs and he said they were probably on drugs When they came over. Some also con tourists into them taking you on a tour, let you take photos and then charge you thousands of rupees not to say anything. Still upset by it now as it's tarnished my last real day of the holiday. :-(



Anyway we then went for lassie in the blue lassie bar which was nice, I had a banana one and apparently it's in the lonely plant guide, not sure why as it was ok but didn't rock my worlds so to speak. However the lassie was lovely and thick and quite sweet with lots of banana and was quite filling, so handy for a stop gap.



Then we went to watch an evening prayer where the trainee priests offer the five elements to the gods and the Ganga river. There were 7 priests to represent the 7 charakas. It was very beautiful so sat and watched it from our boat on the river for a while listening to the monks chant, and watch some of the traditional ceremony. It happens every evening at 8pm for anyone visiting and there's were well over 1000 people watching both on the shore line and on boats on the river.



We then went for food and I had a cheese and tomato pizza lol. It was at the sister cafe of the one we visited this morning so again 10% of our spend was going to a local school. Then a tuk tuk home to the hotel We got stuck in traffic and found ourselves being followed by a man who had taken a shine to Mary and was walking with his dick out in his hand. We moved slowly through the traffic and he kept catching up to us, and just as he started walking along side of us we moved. He had a demonic obsessive look in his eyes. We tried not to make eye contact Nd ignore him and pretended to be in conversation and eventually we go moving but he started running after us, but luckily we moved in quite quickly and we list him. A bit unnerving for all us 3 ladies but especially for Mary as she seemed to be the object of his obsession.

Not the best way to end such a fantastic trip with a great bunch of travel companions. However there are far better memories to remember, lots of photos, great conversations and lots of fun and laugher to remember for many years to come. So thank you everyone For making my first trip memorable in so many ways. :-)

May 2nd 2014

Good morning readers it's 08.25am as I write this blog and I'm in a sleeper train from Orchha to Varenasi. Now this has been an experience, but it will get to that later.



So yesterday we had a chill out day due to our previous and soon to come hectic schedule. So we headed off on the next stage of our journey.



We had a shortish bone rattling journey to the house of a local, lady's house for an Indian cookery demonstration presented to us by Vandana. She was lovely and very welcoming and introduced us to her husband, daughters and her sister and nephew and mother whom were all visiting.



She showed us how to cook a variety of dishes ( masala chai tea, aloo palak,bait an which is an egg plant dish, vegetable pulac, racists, paratha and lentils) which we all hungrily tucked into afterwards. We then had our hands and feet painted with henna and then had a photo shoot. I had my right hand and left foot painted - don't worry mum they are not permanent lol. Marymount and Steph had both hands and feet done and Latoya had her right foot done. All the patterns we had were individual to us and vandana's niece also helped out. Apparently they go to classes to learn how it's done.



Vandana got married at 16 and was unable to conceive children so applied to be a teacher as she was at home all day with not much to do. When she applied they didn't want to employ her as she had not finished her education. However undaunted she said let me work for you for a month and watch me teach and if you like what I do you can pay me and if not you do not have to pay me. Needless to say she got the job.



She and her husband have worked hard to move from living in a one bedroom place at the back of a shop to a lovely little new build home with separate bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom and lounge. When she was working at the school an Australian exchange teacher visited and was asked to tea and was so,impressed with Vandana's cooking that she suggested she run cookery demonstrations. So she learned English and started the classes.



She saved up the money and paid for IVF and had twins a boy and a girl, but sadly the boy died as he had a hole in his heart. She now has two daughters who are a handful lol. So I have to admire her as she has worked hard and has overcome personal adversity and tragedy to have a small but successful business., a lovely family and supportive husband. He runs a stall selling tourist items near the abandoned temple I mentioned in a previous blog.



So after the meal and henna fun we headed out to the train station for another bone rattling journey. On our journey back to the station we we re stopped by an army/police road block vehicle check. They had guns! Apparently the elections were taking place that day in that region and there was extra security put on. All was good and we got through ok but Dushaynt had to have his bag checked.



We arrived in plenty of time to catch the train so waited in the ladies only waiting room. It was rather hit in there and there was an old lady taking up 3 seats. So eventually our guide asked the waiting room attendant to ask her to ove, to which the old lady gave them both a mouthful of abuse saying she was ill and tired etc so she refused to move.



So so finally the sleeper train arrived, about 20 mins late, so let the fun begin! It was a scrabble to get on the train and the lady who pushed in front of Latoya got her she caught and dropped it between the train and the platform. She tried to get it but couldn't so her husband tried but was holding all the passengers up waiting to get on. The train only stops for a certain amount if time at each station so you need to be quick to get on! So we did the done thing and pushed passed to make sure we made it on the train.



First hurdle negotiated successfully. We found our seats and pushed our bags under theM. Steph got caught in the mele of people getting on and filing past our seats and was forced up against the window and couldn't get to us, only anew feet away. People do not give way or let people past so Steph took matters in to her own hands and picked and barged her way through.



Once everyone was settled and had found their seats/bunks we organised our sleeping arrangements, so yes I have 'slept with my tour guide' but it was all above board and we all had separate bunks. They were arranged 3 on each side and the middle bunks folded down and are held in place by straps. Everyone is given a pillow and two bed sheets a blanket is optional. We did have AC and a fan, and it got flippin cold in the night so I had to wrap both sheets around me to try and keep warm.



I was on the bottom bunk with Latoya opposite me, Mary and Steph had the middle bunks and Chris and Dushaynt had the top bunks. As they are both over 6 foot their legs dangled off the edge which was funny to see. With their sheets over their feet I said it looked like they were in a morgue lol.



The train was very crowded and many of the passengers were police and army people returning home after the elections. It was noisy with people walking past chatting or on the phone - hello hello,hello etc, the door to the carriage banging shut after people had walked through



The AC was on full so it was cold but we didn't know how to get a blanket. We had to sleep with our personal belongings to keep them safe, so I used my rucksack as a pillow but it wasn't comfy. I settled in head phones on, Neil diamond playing to hopefully drift off, but sadly no that luxury was to be taken away from me.



There was an increasing amount of people coming past, and stopping by our bunks to stand durning the journey to their stop and some very funky smells as Steph delicately put it. So eventually I drifted off only to awaken to find a man sitting on the end edge of my bunk and Latoya also had the same joy. Dushyant must have heard us talking about the bizarre situation and asked the men to move as we were female and their presence was making us uncomfortable. The one on Latoya's bed moved but the one on my bunk took a bit more persuading. They even shone a torch at us to check Dushyant was telling the truth!



Then an army guy came through and slept on the floor just by the door to get to the corridor to go to the loo making it difficult for people to get past, and of course my bladder chooses this occasion to fill up so I had to make 3 Old lady wee stops! The final loo visit being more like a scene from Indiana Jones as it was the most difficult to negotiate the squatting, standing and sleeping people in the corridor, most of them police and army people with guns!



And so the night continued, freezing, noisy people sitting on the edge of our beds, and walking past or stain ding near our bunks chatting very loudly to each other or on their phones etc so no sleep til Varenasi ( a tribute to the Beastie boys there lol).



To put the icing on the cake in the morning I woke to find a red t shirt clad guy posing in the mirror and quaffing his hair in our bunk area. Latoya and I were watching him and I thought he was checking Steph out but Latoya reckons he was going for her bag but he saw she was looking at him so he did one and left sharpish.



Finally we were pulling into Varanasi we had to wait 45 mins in the heat with no AC and only a ceiling fan to keep us cool. Sweaty Betty is all I can say! So finally we arrived at the platform and headed to our hotel ........ The story continues

Afternoon readers it's 13.26 here in a hot and sweaty Varanasi but I'm in a cool AC room



Time for another thrilling instalment of my blog lol. So picking up from my last entry we arrived in Varanasi hot, tired and hungry. It was a short, but verynhot and sweaty walk from the train station to the hotel. As usual we had to dodge to maic traffic and avoid an early death on the roads lol but we managed it and all arrived at the air conditioned hotel all in one piece.



We headed to our rooms for a quick shower and then meet for lunch in the restaurant. I am sharing with Mary. In most hotel rooms on this trip we have had to insert the key fob in to a slot behind the door to activate the leccy and AC. So Mary popped the key fob in but nothing! However this is not unusual as through out our trip we have been experiencing power cuts from time to time, so we thought nothing of it. So our plan of attack was to open the curtains so we could shed some light on the subject, leave the bathroom door open so we could see to shower, then close the curtains again so we could get dressed as there were no blinds or net curtains at thecwindow, and we did not want to give the flats across the way a full on nude showing lol.

So then we tried to shower, but could not get any water from the shower despite our best efforts. So a strip wash at the sink it was to try to remove some of the sweat and grime of the last 24 hours. And can I say for the record my clothes were manky and had a funky smell - delightful lol.

So we made do and got washed and changed and went to the restaurant. We advised Dushyant of our dilemma and he got reception on it straight away. We were then advised we had not pushed the key fob in the right way or far enough so in fact all was ok with the leccy and it was also user error on the tap front too! Oh well, but in our defence all my fellow travellers also said they had problems with the shower taps too lol.

So after lunch we had a short rest and then we headed out for a tour of the part of the city where they make silk bedding, scarves, pashminas etc. we took a crazy tuk tuk ride to meet our guide who was an old man who had worked in the industry all his life. He explained to us about how many different processes were involved in the industry and that the man and women worked separately.



The area of the city we went to was a poorer area and was a Muslim community. he explained that they had been hand and machine weaving silk cloth in the area for many generations and the skills were passed down from farther to son and mother to daughter. We saw how they had made the cards to make the patterns for the machine to weave the cloth. We were shown how they spin the threads and weave the cloth both by hand and by machine. All the locations were in different parts of the area but were within wakling distance. It's hot sweaty and very noisy work. Going from place to place the kids said hello and we had to pick our way through animals of various descriptions, mopeds, street vendors, rubbish, cyclists, bamboo scaffolding and kids playing in the steet. Of course it was hot and there were the smells of food cooking and some not so nice smells too.



After our tour we visited a supplier of various silk items so we could see what he had to sell. He showed us some amazing bedding, scarves, saries, pashminas and cloth. Some very intricate, some one offs, some very expensive and some cheaper items. He told us about the various items and how they were made and how long it took. Obviously the more intricate items took longer to make and were more expensive especially when they were one offs, had lots of hand sewing or lots of beading work included. I ended up buying a scarf to kep me warm when I get beck lol.



So after our purchasers were complete we took another crazy tuk tuk ride back to the hotel. Then four of us went out for tea to a local restaurant. On the way we saw an Indian wedding (well no day is complete without an Indian wedding lol) but on this occasion we did not gate crash. Just as we arrived at the restaurant there was a power cut. So we had dinner by candle light and then as we're were leaving the lights came back in again, typical lol.



When we got back to the hotel guess what ......... Yes there was an Indian wedding in full flow, just the reception so the lobby was packed with guests and the sound of the party voices and music was coming up from the room the reception was being held in. No we didn't gate crash but headed off to bed as we had to up at 4am to see the sunrise over the Ganga (Ganges to you and me) as we took a boat ride along the shore line.

My next blog will be about that ......

Hi everyone, well as you can guess by lack of updates I have been having wifi issues. This time it's intermittently on and off and I have to sit in a fan cooled room but it's still very warm.



I'm still in Alipura but later today we are heading to varenasi via the sleeper train so I sure that will be an interesting experience.



So yesterday morning after breakfast we headed out to see the karma sutra temples. There are two complexes one north which is the one we visited and one a few miles away which is the south complex. I think there were about 6 or 7 temples altogether in the north complex. Next door was a working temple as lots of people were visiting to pray and leave offerings, and the minks were chanting. Also you can tell a working temple as they have flags flying . The replies we visited are amazing and still look so new and beautiful and the photos do not do them justice, like the Taj Mahal . The carvings are stunning and considering they were built centuries ago the craftsmanship is a credit to the stonemasons who created them.



There are of course lots of naughty carvings depicting various sexual positions, even depictions of beastiality! Yes it went on even back then. There were of course other carvings of elephants, camels, dancing, fighting etc, so not all about sex lol.



From there we went to the nature reserve for lunch and then headed out to see what we could see . Monkeys antelope, deers, king fishers, peacocks etc but sadly no tigers despite our best efforts, so we left a little disappointed, but I did feel privileged to have seen the animals in the natural habitat.



So we finally got back around 9.20pm on a new minibus as the other one we had didn't have great AC. We are staying in the same hotel, as last night which I didn't realise so packed again this morning lol.



Throughout the day when on the mimi bus we had bone rattling journey as the roads around here are in a very poor state. We think we have problems with pot holes in the UK well you ain't seen nothing yet (in the words of Batman turner overdrive lol) so we had to drive on the wrong side of the road, in the verges, avoiding on coming traffic, mopeds, trucks, cars, cows and goats oh and cyclists. I think we all felt like we were being shaken up like peas in a big tin box lol



Tomorrow we have a chill day and don't have to head out until 3.15pm some won't be doing too much or getting up too early lol.!then we are off for a local cookery course and food and then we head off on the over night train to varenasi. Should be interesting. More updates to follow

Evening everyone



Well as promised here is today's update all about the Taj Mahal. Well we were up at the crack of dawn this morning to head out to Indians most famous monument. So at 5.10am we left the hotel and drove the short distance to the car park. They don't let petrol and diesel vehicles near so we had to park up and then took the electric bus to near the gates. We got there about 05.20am and were very near the front, only beaten by a small group of Germans. Top tip for those visiting in the near future,get there early, don't take any food etc in. You can take cameras but not iPods etc. Getting in early pays dividends. The gates opened at 05.45am. You do get your bags checked and a body search so this is what delays things so pack light to help speed things up. Ladies in one queue and gents in another.



We quickly headed to the main monument and we're not disappointed. Out guide for the day showed us the best spots for photo opportunities and we manage to get plenty of shots in with no one
image
else somit looks like the place was deserted. However the crowds soon flocked in and spoiled the natural beauty.



The monument was built by one of the mogul rulers to honour the memoray of his 3rd wife. He saw her at the lady only market when he dressed up and disguised himself as a woman and when he saw her he fell In love. So they married and she gave him 14 children. On their wedding night he lifted her veil and named her Mumtaz and so hence forth that is what she was called. They were deeply in love and rarely separated and married for 19 years I think.



Whilst he was away fighting a war she was carrying his 14th child. Sadly spshe suffered from internal bleeding and died. However bfore he went off to battle he ensured that he had regular messenger updates as to her health. one such messenger advised him she had given birth to a boy and all was wells. He thought he was doing the riget thing and did it not want to distract the king from the battle. However Mumtaz sent one of her daughters to
image
fetch the king back and when he arrived she died indies arms. However before he died shemade him promise 3 things. One was that he would never marry, two that he would look after all her children and thirdly to show how much he loved her he should build something to honour her memory So he built the Taj Mahal which is based in the design from a Persian architect.



I have been told that soon thy may stop visitors entering the inner tomb simply duemto the volume of visitors, at its peak around 99k visitors a day can view the monument. It's taking it's toll on the flooring. The tombs you can see are replicas as the original on pets are in a vault. You used to be able to see them but again due to the volume of visitors the areas was closed.



I also need to point out that its was vary hot even at 7.30am in the morning and during the day it probably got up,to about 45 degrees!

So we had breakfast at a local cafe, an egg wrap which was rather rubbery and tated like a Cornish
image
pasty if I'm honest. We then headed to Agra fort where the mogul king and Mumtaz. Another amazing building.



Somother rest of the dabyways spent chilling and I popped over the road for a macdonlads but it wasnt the same as the ones back in the UK.



This evening we visited the baby Taj although it was built before the big one. Then it was off for tea at Pizza Hut! Yeas I have an American themed food day today lol. Complete with dancing waiters at 8pm - very blizzare but entertaining.



On our way to get the tuk tucks we passed an Indian wedding so we popped inside to see the groom and have our photos taken with him. Very random to gate crash a wedding but in indian everyone is seen to belong to one family so everyone is welcome, so no gatecrashing involved really.



Now it's off to bed as we are heading off by train to Orcha.



Hopefully an update tomorrow evening pending wifi.



Night All. X

Greetings readers I hope you are well and all is good in your world.



It's been a ling day today, we left Tordi gar at half seven after our breakfast - today I had porridge! Again it's the little Pleasures in life that you miss lol.

So it was a long journey to Agra and tomorrow we get to see the sunrise over the Taj Mahal how very exciting!

During our epic journey we mad a couple of stops along the way. The first was to a very old temple which is dedicated to the monkey god and where over 1000 monkeys live. Most of them were in the hills but we saw a lot in the tree outside the compound and then some further on in the compound. There were also,the obligatory bulls / cows wandering around. as previously mentioned they are considered a holy animal in the Hindu faith along with monkeys and peacocks. Our driver has peacock feathers in the mini bus to keep away evil spirits. So I have decided I'm happy to come back as a monkey, peacock or holy cow in my next life. I've Ben told by Dushaynt our
image
tour guide, that of over 1000 different types of cow around the world only the one with the hump on their necks is considered holy.



The temple is very old and children still attend some religious education there to,learn about the hindu religion. We were blessed as we entered by the lady on the gate and received the red dot on our foreheads which apparently is a sign of good luck. So we wandered around the complex and then walked to the area where we could see the monkeys playing ad also swimming and feed them. Well as previously advised I'm not a fan of monkeys as i think they are ugly and look pretty evil personally and certainly don't like them near me, so I was on my guard to say the least. Dush did offer to give me some monkey food and some could feed them but I declined.



After watching the kids playing and swimming etc we wandered further into the complex and climbed some stairs to a pool where people were swimming and kids playing. The water comes out of the hillside and is considered sacred/holy as the area is
image
one of the driest in India and the water never runs out - hence it being holy. So we continued up the hill to see more monkeys and where I was finally persuaded to feed the furry creatures. I have a couple of photos of me in action, one with a real yuk grimace on my face and one of me smiling (fake smile I have to say lol).



After all the excitement we wandered back and visited the temple. We were blessed by a holy priest and given a string to tie round the arm or trunk of the elephant god who the Hindus always invite to weddings, new house, or even when they buy a new car for good luck. We then went to a different part of the temple and saw a lamp in a shrine which has been burning for over 400 years. Again ewe were blessed by another priest and had a string tied around our wrists. Left for unmarked ladies and right for men and married ladies. Apparently in the Hindu religion the left side of the body represents females and the right males. So today we have been very blessed.
image


From there we had some lunch at a roadside restaurant. Let's just say the warier wouldn't win any awards for his warm fluffy table side manner! The food wasn't that great either! Latoya thought she found a grub or worm in one of her dishes but he insisted it was rice. However he took the dish away and changed it for a fresh one.



Later in the afternoon we visited Chand Baori Abaneri which is one of the oldest step wells in Rajistan. It's a square pool 19.5m deep and is surrounded on each side by steps which create a great effect in the sunshine and shade. I will to upload photos once I suss out how to do it.

So after around 11 hours on the road and with stop offs on the way we finally made it to Agra.

It's 10.20pm so,it's off to bed for me as I have an early start. Night all x

Hi everyone,



Sorry I haven't blogged for the last couple of days but we had no internet access last night and the last evening in Jaipur my pay wifi ran out before I had time to do an update. So I'm going to put all my updates on tonight.

Jaipur



Apologies for no updates over the last couple of days. My internet time ran out in Jaipur before i could update my. Log. Yesterday we're were in Tordi Garh and the hotel had no wifi!. So today I catching up,on my travels.



We visited the amber palace yesterday which is a massive complex built over hundreds of years by 3 different maharajas, each one adding to the previous buildings. It's a vast complex cleverly built on a hill side with a 360 view of the surrounding area surrounded by a 16KM wall to protect it, similar in style to the great wall of China.



If any enemies were spotted the soldiers used drums to communicate the impending attack and at night they used drums and fires as warnings.

On our accent up to the palace gates we encountered lots of elephants which are used by tourists to carry them up to the gates and into the complex. Some of them were beautifully painted and I hope to upload some photos on here soon so you can all see. Steph petted one of the elephants but then got sprayed by the one behind. I said she'd got covered in elephant snot but I jut think it was water it had stored in its trunk lol. Very funny though.



The palace is very cleverly built so that it harvested the rain water, had sewerage systems, hot and cold running water, ventilation systems and lots of secret passages to allow the royal family to escape and cause confusion should the palace be invaded.



In one area of the place was the marharajines quarters but the accommodation was located next to the area where the maharaja would conduct private business. When this was happening no women were allowed in the vicinity. Also they created a ventilation system which allowed air and light in but did not allow you tossed in or out of corridors and rooms. All very fascinating.



The maharaja had 12 wives and over 100 mistresses! How much nookie does one man need for goodness sake!



The wives all,had separate apartments and rooms and we're not allowed to talk to each other unless the marharjine gave them permission. The first wife of the maharaja was the most important as she was chosen by other members of the royal family.



When they had children they here only allowed tomstaynwithntheir mothers until they were 5years old and were then moved to a separate area of the palace to be educated. Also,once the wives were past their sell by date (so to speak) they too were also moved to a different part of the palace to,live out their days.



Altogether the palace housed around 3000 people including the royal family, servants, cooks, soldiers, eunuchs etc.



After spending s few hours at the amber palace we made our way down and then fed the pigeons s it's classed as good luck and will ensure you never run out of money! Fingers crossed it works for me then or I may be heading home early lol.



Just befoew we got back in the coach Chris wanted to take a photo of a bull standing on the pavement, but the bull had other ideas and tried to move Chris out of the way with its horns, over never seen anyone move so fast lol. Again another funny moment.



From the amber palace we then gap headed back in to Jaipur but stopped off on the way to take photos of the summer palace on the lake where the royal family lived during the summer months as it was cooler there.the only way to get to it is via boat so quite a safe place to stay too

We then head lunch and head back to the hotel for a few hours r and r.

In the evening we took a local bus to the market to have a wander around and learn some more about the local way of life and traditions. It was full of spicy smells and some rather not so nice smells too. There is a store which grinds up the chilli peppers people bring to make them in to powder. The dust gets in your nose and makes you sneeze and cough, I can't imagine doing that all day every day. The sound of people chatting and car horns blowing etc all going in around us. Such a cacophony of smells and sounds all competing and melting with one another.and of course not forgetting the heat lol.



We took some photos of one of the large roundabouts from the top of a Hindu temple and amongst the chaos was a cow. It seems amongst all the traffic the cow top trumps all other road users, kill a cow and you are damed for life and will go straight to hell! Note to self to kill a cow with my car lol.



We also visited a jewellery store and they showed us around including the workshops where they make all the jewellery by had including bespoke items. It was a lovely showroom but far too expensive for me. However I had a free drink and remembered the luxury of carpet under my bear feet - it's the little things you miss when you are away :-)

Tordi Garh



Hi readers this section of my blog is all about Tordi Garh - I guess the title gives it away lol.



It's a small village in ? It's about a 2.5 hour drive from Jaipur. It's in the middle of nowhere and is a recent destination added to,our tour to give us a flavour of rural India. We are staying in a small family run hotel which is basic but clean and comfortable, and has air conditioning in the rooms- bonus!



When we arrived we were greeted with a garland of marigolds and had the red dot put on our foreheads - I must find out why they do that. And a welcome drinks. Once settled in our rooms we had some home cooked lunch and afterwards a few hours R and R. I have to admit today I'm not feeling so good so, just popped a couple of pills and had some sleep, and now feeling somewhat better.



This evening we had a walk round the village. It's very traditional here, they have to go to a well to collect the water, pigs roam around the streets eating the rubbish, collecting fire wood etc. The local kids were happy to see us and say hello and have their pictures taken ""one photo"" was the phrase of the day. Dhushant played cricket and lost the ball and had to pay for a replacement lol.



They also collect the cow dung and dry it out nard use it to fuel their fires and then use the ashes to clean the dishes. All very green!



After touring round the village and cheating to the villagers and taking photos Dhushant tried his hand at making a pot after we watched the potter make some. Needless to say he won't be giving up the day job any time soon lol.



Finally we took a camel cart ride through the village to the outskirts where we climbed a dune and watched the sun set over the valley drinking tea and beer and eating chocolate biscuits - how very civilised.



Finally it was time to head back for a home cooked tea, eaten out on the terrace by candle light under the stars, ah it's a tough life.



Todays update to be published later x

India on a Shoestring Part 2

Sunday 30th

Up at 5am....who gets up at 5am on a Sunday...and the morning after dancing to Ricky Martin on a rooftop at a restaurant!

We got a public coach today, interesting experience...we had chairs which were rather claustrophobic due to be packed into the bus and underneath sleeper beds! Not much head room!

The journey was 6 hours through desert-esque scrubland, and we had one loo stop where the toilet was behind a pile of timber!

To be honest the journey was rather uneventful...read, played candy crush and listened to music.

We arrived in Jodhpur just after lunch and after checking in we sat in the hotel garden and had some lunch. We then had some freetime, which we used to sleep! Late afternoon we met up with the group and took tuktuks to the fort.

Firstly we stopped off at the market area and did a quick orientation around the market area...narrow streets where we were again avoiding cows, crap, dogs, people, tuktuks and motorbikes!

After a quick walk around the market we went upto the fort and took an audioguide around the fort. Its
image
an impressive huge fort perched on the hill overlooking Jodhpur, the blue city. We spent over an hour wandering round listening to the irritating man on the audioguide...he had a rather posh english accent and pronounced cous cous 'cuss cuss'. Tit!

After the fort we went to a homestay owned by a family that Ankur, our guide, knows well. We sat in the internal courtyard of their home and had amazing homecooked food, which included rice, chicken, paneer, vegetable, sweet mango pickle etc. homecooked food is definitely best!

There was no partying tonight just early to bed!



Monday 31st

Another early start and another bus for 7 hours to Udaipur. The bus was another public bus with chairs underneath sleeper beds.

Again the bus was rather uneventful....passed miles and miles of marble companies whilst listening to music, reading and playing candy crush!

Upon arriving at Udaipur we had a few hours to rest before going on an orientation powerwalk! Ankur walks so fast I practically have to run to keep up with him!

We wandered past the palace and around the narrow streets before popping into an artists studio where they
image
talked us through how they did miniature paintings before painting a miniature picture on one of our fingernails! We then carried on walking down to the lake, and then went to a heritage dancing event. We sat on the floor inside a beautiful heritage home with the amazing architecture lit up by coloured lights and bats flying around us! We had 6 different traditional dances shown to us, the dancers were amazing! There were women with flaming pots on their heads, spinning around and women with tiny cymbals attached to their clothes in all different places and they spun a cymbal in their hand around and hit the cymbals in turn producing an amazing tune.

Some women also then did a dance usually performed at weddings which was amazing to watch as they all had different sparkly coloured dresses on.

After dancing we met another Gadventures group for dinner, Shiv's group. We had a nice meal and then went back to the hotel for guess what....a party on the roof! A couple of people from Shiv's group including Ragu, the tour guide, came back to our hotel to join in the festivities. Another Gadventures group consisting of 16
image
women who were doing Delhi to Goa were already on the roof with their guide Gerry who looked exactly like Che Guevara even down to the hat!

We had a drink, danced on podiums then joined in a drinking game the other group were playing! They called it 'ring of fire' which is basically 'kings' with different rules! Luckily there were so many of us playing and only one pack of cards so the game didn't last long and the damage was quite low! We then continued to dance into the early morning...most people disappeared off from 1am onwards with Ankur and myself being the last 2 standing! After clearing up we finally called it a night at 4am! Immense! Glad to say that even though I am on a YOLO (you only live once) tour where all the other group members are between 10-15 years younger than me that I am the last one standing! Booooyah....



Tuesday 1st April

Today we had the opportunity to lie in, which would have been marvellous if building works hadn't started at 8am! Zoe and I woke up worse for wear and then decided we wanted pancakes for
image
breakfast! We went down to the hotel restaurant but the only breakfast was buffet, so we went out into the bright streets on a pancake hunt! First was Cafe Coffee Day across the road...no pancakes only samosas. Then we tried about 3 hotel restaurants down the road but all had their restaurant on the 5th floor which was too much to deal with at that point in time! So we admitted defeat and went back to our hotel and had toast and chocolate milkshake!

After breakfast we went back to the room and lazed around until 12.30pm. When we met up with the group and jumped in tuktuks upto the palace. Zoe, Miriam and myself went into the palace and spent a good few hours wandering around the beautifully decorated rooms and gardens. Afterwards we went to the restaurant in the palace grounds and had a peach and apricot mocktail and some amazing houmous and pitta. Then we headed back to the artists studio where we had been the night before having miniature nail paintings done! We then had henna done, mine was a rather elaborate affair on my palm and up my inside arm. We also got miniature
image
paintings done on the rest of our fingernails, so I now have mini paintings of a rose, a camel, an elephant, a bird, a peacock, Shah Jahan, Mumtaz Muhal and the Taj Mahal amongst other designs!

Afterwards we met early for dinner and ate at another amazing rooftop restaurant whilst the sun went down.

No partying, early night as early start again!



Wednesday 2nd April

This morning was another early morning start for a train to Pushkar. The train was another 7 hour job where we were supposed to sit on bench style seats but luckily the train was empty for the first few hours so we all grabbed a bench each and slept. Once the train started filling up we all sat together and played cards to pass the time. This time the 7 hours went quickly and before we knew it we were arriving into Ajmer station, which was about 40 minute drive from our hotel in Pushkar.

We had a few hours rest before going out late afternoon for an orientation walk. It took a good half an hour to walk from the hotel to the centre of town and
image
there are very few tuktuks available! Firstly we went to the Brahma temple which is the only temple in the world dedicated to Brahma, then we walked to the lake before having dinner and watching the sunset from a lakeside restaurant.

After dinner we walked back to the hotel and hit bed early as we had sunrise hike in the morning.



Thursday 3rd

Up and out at 5am and jumped in tuktuk for 15 minute drive to start of steps upto the temple where we were to watch the sunrise from.

The steps started off as lovely concrete jobs and then changed to uneven, steep stone jobs! We climbed for 20 minutes or so before the path got really steep and the climb was part on all fours! At this point i conveniently found an amazing viewing spot off the path on a huge boulder right in prime location for sunrise watching. Myself and Krissy (who hadn't been very well) stopped just shy of the top and got comfortable on our personal rock seat. It was so peaceful, no sound apart from birds and the occasional indian climbing up the path listening to bollywood
image
music! At one point a saddhu fully clad in orange appeared and proceeded to dance for us under the tree! The sun peeked over the mountains and we watched in awe as it bathed the valley and city in golden light. After sitting for half an hour or so the rest of the group came back down and sat with us for a few minutes taking in the view before we walked back down and walked to a restaurant for breakfast.

Breakfast was pancakes! Yay! I had the mixed fruit pancake which was immense and just what I needed after climbing up most of a mountain and coming back down all before 9am!

After breakfast we went back to the hotel and went back to bed! Slept until 3pm when we got up and all took a taxi into town, we then went to another rooftop restaurant for late lunch. I had houmous, pitta, salad and chips which was a nice change from curry! Lunch was entertaining...a young lad that was working there came out and offered us free homemade pesto because his boss was away!

After finishing lunch he then offered us all a free piece
image
of Indian style banoffee pie followed by some homemade muesli. Just as we were wondering what else he would bring us for free he appeared with hash cookies. We all declined at this point and left without a free trip as we had shopping to do!

We took a slow saunter back to the hotel, stopping off at various shops on the way back.

We had dinner in the hotel restaurant and then had another party on the rooftop! This time it was just us and another tour guide called Ricky. We played cards for a while then 'Kings' drinking game, followed by general dancing to psychedelic trance under the stars. 3am came and bed was calling, Zoe, Kirsty and I were the only ones left standing, well Zoe was quite drunk and barely capable of standing! Lol



Friday 4th

Lie in.....yippee..... We got up at 8am and went to the restaurant for breakfast at 9ish. Today we had the luxury of a private air conditioned car and a departure time of 9.45am.

We drove for 3 hours or so and reached Jaipur at lunchtime, had a snack in the hotel restaurant before
image
having a rest for 2 hours.

We then met for an orientation walk around the new city before going to the cinema to watch a new bollywood release. As normal the audience really get into the film, all laughing out loud at the funny parts, whistling at the romantic parts, cheering at the good parts and generally chatting on their phones or to each other whilst having a little picnic!

The film was nearly 3 hours long including a 15 minute interval, so we didn't leave the cinema until late. Dinner was a dirty chicken burger at McDonalds which was fun, so many staff members and still chaos!



Saturday 5th

Met at 8.30am and with local guide took tuktuk to Amber Fort, stopping on way to take photos of the windy palace. We the jumped out at Amber Fort and were met by Snake Charmers, so spent a few minutes watching them. We then walked up into the Amber Fort, its a good 15 minute climb! There was a man who was making his way up by taking a step then kneeling before lying prostrate on the ground, then repeating this all the way

to the temple. This is apparently because he went the year before asked for something from the gods and promised to do this if he was given his wish. Clearly he got what he wanted and is now demonstrating his thankfulness.

Once at the top we popped into the temple where people are offering huge bottles of alcohol for blessings. We just strolled in, got given a flower garland then blessed and told to leave! Lol

We wandered around the Amber Palace for about an hour before walking back down and jumping in a tuktuk to the water palace for photos. There is normally a hive of activity along the waterfront and this time we had some street kids who have moved on from begging and are now mini magicians. The little indian dynamo did a few amazing tricks for us using coins and wooden balls and cups!

Afterwards we went to a block printing shop and watched a demonstration of block printing prior to some retail therapy in the shop. I ordered a made-to-measure punjab suit in crepe silk, white tunic with blue pattern and blue trousers, it looks pretty swish if I do say so

myself! Then we tried on saris before going to lunch.

After lunch we went back to the hotel to get out of the heat for a few hours. At 5pm we met up and took a tuktuk to the old city to wander round the market stalls. After wandering around for 45 minutes or so we jumped in tuktuks and went to a shoeshop. We spent over an hour int he shoeshop trying on almost every pair of shoes! Purchases in hand we left and headed back to the hotel in a tuktuk for dinner and group briefing with Ankur.

After dinner we made a half hearted attempt to play Taboo before we decided we were all too tired and we went to bed.



Sunday 6th

Up at 5am yet again, left at 5.50am in tuktuks and headed to Jaipur station where we got a train to Agra. The train was much nicer than the Auschwitz types we have been used to! We had seats, air con and meals on wheels breakfast! The train journey was 4 hours to Agra.

Upon arrival we all crashed out and then hit Costa Coffee next door

for lunch. We then went to the Baby Taj and a cool spot on the yamuna river to watch the sunset over the back of the Taj Mahal. Not an angle you normally see it from, was definitely something different for me.

We then went to a rooftop restaurant for dinner and back to the hotel for bed as early start for sunrise at the Taj.

Day Eleven....

The next day (waking up to see that the squirrel from last nigh was in fact, a bunch of plastic flowers...lol) we were free to do as we pleased, Danielle relaxed by the pool, Rhys kept on the computer and Craig and me had a go slow morning and headed to Pushkar to look at the Brahma temple. We met with everyone for lunch then had a stroll round the ghats, where we thought we had lost Rhys to a cult when he was cornered by a priest and ended up reciting prayers with him. Luckily we weren't too far away before things got too cosmic. We walked around the ghat and went to a spot where you could watch the sunset, but they didn't sell beer. Hmmmm..what to do. After a nice juice we headed back to our hotel, and after some under the counters sells, we had some beers and preceded to play president.... This time, for me there was no winning streak.

Day Twelve......

We were in the car for a few hours today and thanks to Danielle's new downloads we could take it in turns to watch the final episodes of Breaking
Jantar Mantar observatory
Jaipur
Bad. This made for an intense car journey! Ashok took us to a great local and cheap eatery for lunch. This consisted of potato cake with sweet lentil curry and a lassi (regular) out of a clay cup. This was delicious. From here we got to our hotel for the night and Ashok dropped us off just outside the Jaipur walls so we could see the Jantar Mantar observatory and city palace. Ive seen the observatory before and had been raving about it to everyone, luckily they liked it (so they said), it was built between 1727 to 1724. I find the place so interesting and so fascinating to look at. There are a curious collection of sculptures, each structure at the intriguing Jantar Mantar observatory has a specialized astronomical function. There are 14 structures in total, which measure time, predict eclipses, and track stars. The most impressive one is the huge Samrat Yantra sundial. At a height of 90 feet (27 meters), it has a shadow that moves roughly the width of a person's hand every minute.

The city palace was owned by one of the richest families in India, and it is sprawling and beautiful. From here
Tired travellers
Jaipur city palace
we took a horse drawn cart to the Hawa Mahal which was constructed in 1799. Legend has it that the palace, which overlooks the main street of Jaipur's lively Old City, was built so that the women of the royal household could watch the streets below without being observed. This was beautiful and I really enjoyed the intricate and dainty architecture as well as the many shades of colours. Highly recommend. Ashok had suggested we go to see a Bollywood film at the famous Raj Mandir cinema so we took him up on this and took a cycle rickshaw to the cinema. En route one car driver got annoyed with our rickshaw driver and decided to ram the back of him whilst us in it, luckily again, we were ok, we felt sorry for the driver who was going to have to pay out for the damages. We had a very western dinner of Mc Donald's (chicken as they don't have meat ones in India) and bought our ticket for the cinema. From what we have learnt of India we decided to pay for the most expensive seats (which cost about (3 pound) rather than be in the mosh pit
En route to the cinema
Jaipur
below. The seats were great, but we would have survived down below no problems. The Bollywood blockbuster we watched was called Terra Hero and it was entertaining. It's funny as half of it is in Hindi and the rest is in English, so for example, something would happen and they would shout 'oh my god' or 'whatever'. I lost the plot about half way in, somehow the main character was transported from India to a mafia boss house in Bangkok trying to get together with a girl. There was dancing, and singing and it really was like a pantomime, the crowd below would whoop and cheer and whistle when the characters fought, or kissed. It did get quite rowdy below and at one point there was a fight! After this was broken up and people ejected everyone carried on with the film, some people must have been having to much fun and getting too excited!

Day Thirteen.....

The next morning we were up early as we had a packed full day of sightseeing. Our first stop was to Chand Baori, which is a very old landmark in Rajasthan. It was built by King Chanda of the Nikumbha Dynasty
Hawa Mahul
between 800 and 900 AD and was dedicated to Hashat Mada Goddess of Joy and Happiness upon completion. It was also used in Batman The Dark Knight Rises. It is a HUGE well. The state of Rajasthan is extremely arid, and the design and final structure of Chand Baori was intended to conserve as much water as possible. At the bottom of the well, the air remains 5-6 degrees cooler than at the surface, and Chand Baori was used as a community gathering place for locals during periods of intense heat.

We stopped briefly for some pictures in front of the Jal Mahul (water palace), which is the palace on the lake.

Our next stop was the Galter monkey temple, this is a ruinous but holy Hindi temple, nestled in peaceful surroundings between two granite cliffs, it is quite an adventure walking up to the temple which is built around the mountains. The temple is part of a larger temple complex, which also has three sacred pools of water. One of the pools has been taken over by thousands of monkeys that congregate there to swim and bathe. They're generally friendly and love to be fed, which we
Batman well
Chand Baori
found out, Craig was passing them nuts to eat which they loved. I didn't stick around too long, didn't want any nuts thrown over my head so the monkeys would come get me! The legend says that the three sacred pools are varying depths said to be two or three elephants high deep.

Next stop was Amber Fort which is set on a hill top overlooking Maota Lake. It was the original home of Rajput royalty until Jaipur city was constructed, and contains a number of breathtaking palaces, halls, gardens, and temples. Inside, the elaborate mirror work adds to the grandeur. It was very pretty, however the whole time, convinced that more from the Dark Knight Rises from Batman well was here (the outside shot), and spent my time with tunnel vision looking for it.

We were all pretty tired, it's a full blown two weeks for sure and when we arrived in a town just outside of Agra, we had some food and headed straight to bed. The hotel was very cheap and I think had India's dirtiest bath/bathroom for sure. We stopped here as we wanted a dose of nature and there is a huge bird
New friends met at Monkey temple
sanctuary here to go see tomorrow.

Day Fourteen....

We got an early night and woke to have breakfast at 6am before going to the sanctuary down the road. Danielle wasn't feeling too well so the three of us plodded on without her. After much confusion over the price of the bird sanctuary, ie they were trying to fleece us, we had one guide (they thought we would need two) and one bike each (they wanted us to hire a rickshaw as well) we were off. I actually quite like a bit of twitching from now and then and despite most of the birds having migrated for the winter there was plenty to see. It must be amazing when all the birds are around, we still saw a decent amount and the guide kept us entertained pointing out different birds and telling us about a book he has coming out with the national geographic. Not sure how true this was. One great suggestion he had was to go and visit Baba, the local guru guy who lives on the grounds and as we were to learn was the dr.dolittle of the Indian world. This was surreal. Baba lives at
Jal Mahul
the temple which is by a lake. We said hi and next thing we knew he was showing us his pictures of him with various animals such as, monkeys, deer and turtles (I'll get back to that in a second). He claimed he had been in magazines but when he showed us he had stuck his pictures onto magazines spread which wa sad little strange, but we went with it giving full enthusiasm. So coming back to these turtles, Baba said if we wanted we could watch him feed the turtles which live in the lake. Yes please, sounds fun. Baba made some dough like concoction and we moved to where you can enter the lake. He then started making noises and splashing at the water and then behold, giant turtles started coming for the food, there must have been at least 10-15 some of them were huge! They were getting very excited and making lots of splashing. A monkey came for a look as well, and beared his teeth at Craig for some reason (monkey complex) which was funny and all in all the experience was surreal. Afterwards as an end scene id say, Baba gave us his business
Amber Fort
card and told us how to find him on Facebook! Bear in mind, this guy lives where there is no electricity or running water and looked like he needed to eat a couple of pies, how did he afford electricity let alone a computer, and internet for that matter!, who knows what's going on there. After some more cycling around and looking at birds it was 10am and time to head back. We met with Danielle and jumped in the car to Agra.

We were quite tired understandably so once we arrived in Agra but we had one last fort to see (they were moulding into one at this point) -Agra fort. It was beautiful and there was a great viewpoint of the two mahul which gave us our first glimpse of this wonder. After here Ashok took us to another viewpoint of Beene taj mahul which was across the river to watch the sunset. This was great, for me I haven't seen the Taj Mahul from this side and to be honest I think it is my favourite view with the river in front of it, it looks very imposing and when the sun sets it makes it
Snake charmer
They appeared to have a love/hate relationship seeing as the snake repeatedly tried to 'get' the charmer with his non existent fangs - beef...
have a pinky tinge which I loved. On the way back ashok took us through a very poor area and where part of the slumdog millionaire film was filmed- if you know it, it is the part when there is a taxi tour and the young boy is 'looking after' the car, when the tour group comes back the car is minus wheels. Ashok thought this was hilarious and was laughing to himself about that scene and how it relates to him for a while.

We were cream cracked after this so relaxed and had a delicious Indian thali meal, followed by an early night. Thali is a selection of various dishes and it great if you want to try different things. You can have a veggie one or meat, and they tend to come with pickle, dahl, rice, roti, curd, some salad and even a little pudding. Its like an all you eat meal, which is always about 1pound in cost.

Day Fifteen....

Today was the last day and we were up early to watch the sunrise over the Taj Mahul. We were up super early and walked like zombies down to the entrance. After a
Baba and his turtles
Whatever Dr.Indian dolittle says, the monkey is trouble
bit of a mix up with us not being allowed to take a tripod in, and having to walk about 500metre to where we could safely leave it before entering we were in. An English girl was trying to get in, dressed in a sari and with Indian friends for the Indian rate, no such luck lm afraid. It did make us laugh. You will probably already know a lot about the Tag Mahal so ill just let you look at the pictures. If you don't, a brief synopsis, it is a mausoleum which the Mughal emperor made in memory of his third wife who died. It is considered one of the wonders of the new world.

We did catch the sunrise (kind of) and felt like we had the place to ourselves before the bus loads of tourists came round. It was beautiful, and we spent our time listening to the audio guide and getting a feel for the place. We had to take our shoes off to enter the main mausoleum and were amused by the security guard heavily draped in weapons who was manning the shoe store - must have been previous alterations over whose shoes
were whose!

We headed back to the hustle and bustle of Delhi, en route we stopped in the middle of the motor way so Ashok could take pictures of us on the road and how safe and modern it was. It is safe and modern, but l don't think standing in the middle of it was a particularly safe thing to do...this really is Indian psyche. We were dropped off, said goodbye to Ashok and the same with Raj and bid fellwell.

Rhys wasnt feeling too well but Craig and me went out for a drink, my first g&T in a month or so!

We enjoyed the taxi trip a lot, we had built it up a lot and despite a couple of bumps in the road (pun INTENDED!) we got there. Shame it couldn't have started as it finished. Great time sharing the experience with friends and a safe, comfortable way to see Rajasthan, recommend!

The view of the ganges from the hostel rooftop
Having been to India previously on my own 10 years ago, its a country which divides opinion, you either love it or hate it. l knew what to expect and l was looking forward to being there with someone else and sharing the experience as it is something like l have never experience before, l was also very much looking forward to eating, lots and lots of eating. We decided to ease our way in we would pre-arrange a taxi pickup with our hostel, which was great as we didn't have to deal with hundreds of taxi drivers all wanting our fare. The hostel is an hour from the airport and it was great for people watching from the safety of the cab, although we did make a couple of pit stops - one to pick up the local chewing leaf (paan) from what seemed like his mates shop and then to swop drivers. You can tell when the men chew paan on a regular basis, as their teeth are stained red, but they do it to get a high rush.

Varanasi is our first destination in India and it's considered one of the holiest, most spiritual city in India
Life on the river
Varansi
and is the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The hostel we found to stop in was a mixture of old and new, the stairways and landings looking quite old and run down but the room being ultra modern! It had a rooftop restaurant with great view of the snaking Ganges and the buildings hugging its eastern shores. Weirdly it also had this indoor conference room, which was ultra modern, not sure how many board meetings a la Alan Sugar style it would see, but it must have been there for someone to use. As soon as we got there we treated ourselves to the much-anticipated Indian cuisine. We had some pakora (a fried Indian snack), to keep us going until we ate a little later, washed down with extra protein in the shape and form of the millions of fruit flies, mozzies and no see’s bugs on the rooftop terrace– welcome to India. Suffice to say, it was yummy! Been very excited for food in India and we felt ready to try it all and get stuck in, bugs an all.

The hostel was located about about 20 minutes via foot from the old city and centre
Varanasi
of Varanasi. This was a great walk and a total assault on the senses; the streets are bustling and filled with life. There are families of pigs, dogs, cats, cows (cows also in huge metal pipe sections that are discarded - I think they are old sewerage pipes) all amongst the normal goings on of stalls, street sellers, rotting rubbish, bicycle taxi's, and people just getting from A to B. This was all before we reached the banks of the Ganges. Some of the smells were pretty overpowering, mainly from the half dried out Assi river with lots of stagnant water, but hey, this in India, I knew what to expect. Day to day life in most places is locked away in houses or neighborhoods which we didn't have access to but here, the river Ganges is integral to a lot of people lives. So things you wouldn't usually see are on show here. It's literally used as a bathroom, from people washing their clothes, brushing their teeth, cleaning their clohes and cleaning themselves to using it as a toilet or a pen to keep their water Buffalo in. Its quite amusing seeing a water Buffalo immersed in water up
Doing his magic
The Blue Lassi, Varanasi
to their heads for the first time! So walking along its banks is an eye opening experience. That combined with the motley selection of old decrepit buildings and lively graffiti, lining the rivers it really is a great experience.

Leaving the riverside and venturing into the old city we didn't really know what to expect. I felt like we were leaving the calm and into the storm. The streets were small and dark; the buildings being so close together that it didn't let much light in. You really did feel like you were in an ancient city. Not really knowing where we were heading we followed these windy streets, again our senses being assaulted by colours and smells, until we reached a very busy market street, which was normal width in size. We were on the hunt for a place called the Blue Lassi, which we had read about in the guidebooks, after asking some directions it was back into the small dark streets. This time it took us past the Shri Vishwanath Temple, which the queue for was huge; there were hundreds of families all holding gifts to take into the temple. It was a squeeze to get
Cows are sacred in India, to eat one probably means in your next life you will be a bug
Varanasi
past them but people trying to get past on their motorbikes made it an even more interesting experience! These small streets were definitely a lot more lively. The Blue Lassi is a bit of a tourist trap and it was our first experience of seeing groups of westerners together since we had arrived in the town. The Lassi's were lovely; they were very thick and very filling! But with the young serving man continually staring at me (my first Indian stalker) it was slightly off putting, the place inside is quite small so at some points he was about a meter away just staring. We had a chuckle about it though; he was mesmerized for some reason!

Still not quite in tune with India on the way back l accidently stood in a huge pile of cow poo (with my flip flops on) and as a quick fix decided to dunk my foot in the ganges to clean it. Without thinking that l had a cut on my foot. 15 minutes later my foot as killing!..convinced l had caught some sort of Indian aids l doused it in savlon and anti bacterial gel as soon as we got back
One of the burning ghats - in front of this the bodies are openly cremated
Varanasi
and stressed my foot was going to need a total clean out at the hospital for absolutely no reason at all. Total Indian novice! I had some toughening up to do. However, l have read that the ganges pollution levels are 3000 over the 'safe' limit, so maybe l had a little to be worried about.

There's a selection of rooftop restaurants along the river and I would definitely recommend going to one, if not as many as possible, if not for getting away from the busy streets below to relax or the great views but to see Monkeys getting chased off by the owners dogs! We ate at some local ones and at more western ones; the local ones were much better with cheaper prices and local food, no hamburgers or annoying loud show off travelers to have to listen to!

The river Ganges is considered sacred to Hindus and is worshipped as the goddess Ganga. A lot of Hindus come to Varanasi to die, because to do is to be granted instant salvation. This is because their ashes are immersed in the Ganges. There are a lot of ghats dotted along the river side. And incase
NOTHING will get between a cow and its grazing
Varanasi
you don’t know a ghat is a series of steps leading down to a body of water (or holy water). Ghats are used for cleaning, ritual bathing, and there are cremation ghats where bodies are cremated waterside allowing ashes to be washed away by the rivers. Cremation ceremonies take place along the Ganges on places called burning Ghats, Ghats are located up and down the river and the term refers to a series of steps leading down to water considered holy, but only 2 we came across were being used for cremation. They were always busy with people and burning mounds, it’s a 24 hours service so to speak. Its hard not to stop and stare but you do feel like you are intruding just by walking around. Its best to be as ‘casual’ as possible and take a seat enough away from the action so you aren’t intruding but close enough you can see and take in the unique experience in a respectful way, taking photos is a massive no no. It’s really intense watching things unfold, with obviously very upset people, burning bodies (at times you could watch the flesh being burned and the bones were visible). At
This small dude gave Craig his first Indian haircut
the main burning Ghat, called Manikarnika Ghat, we were collared by a local asking if we wanted to know more about the place. We knew he'd expect some money but it would be relatively little compared to what we'd find out. He took us up to a room on the 2nd floor of a derelict building over looking the Ghat, the first thing we noticed were the people laid about on the floor - our initial thought being ""OMG! are these bodies waiting to be burnt?!!"" but as it turns out, they were just people who helped out at the Ghat just resting, panic over. Apparently they help the families with the dying and dead bodies. The families main expense for the cremation is the type of wood used, the more money spent the better the wood burns. It sometimes means poorer families relatives aren't burnt properly and just deposited in the river in the river is a half burnt state. It's the job of the social underclass, the ""untouchables"" to then sieve out the remains for jewellery or fillings. Can you actually imagine doing that for a job??? It was a very interesting experience but slightly spoiled by our
Ganga Aarti ceremony
donation ""not being enough"".

We organised a boat trip through our hostel to see the evening ceremony at the dashahwamedh ghat. This ghat is the main one in Varanasi and said to be the most spectacular, and every evening at this ghat is the Ganga Aarti. This is when a group of priests daily in the evening perform the ‘Agni Pooja’ (worship to fire) where they make their dedications to the Lord Shiva (the ganges), Surya (Sun), Agni (fire) and the whole universe. There are many stages to the ceremony and it’s a mixture of incense, fire, lights, smoke, drums and chanting. Lots of lots of people hire boats to go watch and also children (with fantastic English language·) sell you candles, which you light, and put in the ganges to float away. We got stuck in with this, and a very cheeky pair of chaps sold us some floating candles they had made with and sold us at a price that in the grand scheme of things was not too expensive but in India terms, was definitely at an inflated price!..And despite the boys working as a team one of them was quite unwilling to share his extra
The women in the middle is the lady who before this picture was taken almost drowned in the ganges!
profits, after some telling off he handed it over and they jumped onto another boat to play the same tricks again, not bad for two children who were 7 years old.

We had read that there was a similar boat trip up the ganges in the morning watching the sunrise so we asked our boat guy to hook us up the next day. He said that he wasn’t feeling well and was heading to the hospital after he dropped us off but would pick us up in the morning. We weren’t sure if this was a ploy for money or if he was really sick. Suffice to say, we set our alarms and were up for 5am, no sign of the boat dude. Hope he was ok!

One of our favourite things to do whilst in Varanasi was simply to sit down on the river side and people watch. It was fascinating watching the world walk past, people walking to and from work, holy men wandering past, people selling street food and souvenirs, and the other tourists having their own experiences. One set of tourists we and many other clapped eyes on were a set from Asia. They
People watching sittng on the riverside was a highlight
Varanasi
were taking it in turns to jump into the ganges…turns out one lady had forgotten she couldn’t swim or had thought it was shallower than it actually was and started drowning after voluntarily jumping in. This turned into a huge scene with one of her friends jumping in to save her and she almost drowned him as well when finally a man in a fishing boat stuck his paddle out for her to hold onto and managed to drag her and her friends onto the boat! Oh the shame! After a minute she was much better and her and her friends took some pictures of them having been to the ganges, l can imagine the caption – I survived drowning in the ganges. Crazy people.

On our second to last day in Varanasi we had our real experience of getting agitated in India, we wanted to post some things home as our backpacks were at breaking point. 5 hours later and multiple tuk tuk journeys being led down the garden path, many lies said to how to post things home from people trying to ‘help’ and lots of busy traffic and sore feet later and we found and succumbed
Flashpackers...AC1 Sleeper train to Delhi
Varanasi
to a courier services and handed over £30 putting our trust that the package would make it back. Suffice to say, there is still no sign of it and my precious parahawking pictures which were in the package! Should have listened to our guts and never handed it over when we weren’t 100% sure we could trust the guy. Lesson learnt. Bad Karma onto him.

We spent a few days here and moved onto Deli using the train – Our first experience on the Indian Train network. As it had taken me around a month to get set up on the cleartrip railways website – this enables us to buy our own tickets and not get ripped off by agents l was dubious of if it would all come together. Luckily it DID.

As it was our first over night train journey we again eased our way in and went on AC first class. Meaning we had dinner, food and our own private cabin. Total flash packers at this stage! The cabin consisted of a bunk bed, fan, light and table. A lovely way to travel overnight to Delhi, and all for around £30 each for a 12

Geo: 26.9847, 78.1019

Yesterday was the last full day of our tour in India. We are here today as well, but the tour ended after we arrived back in Delhi, so this afternoon is ours to do with what we like, although we are far from any markets or good restaurants, and it is Holi, the ancient Hindu religious festival when people throw paint and water on anyone they can. (This is very similar to Songkran in Thailand, although that holiday is in April, not March.) But even though Holi is also called the festival of colors, I wonder how the paint originally came into play, and what is the significance of the colors? Here the young men paint their faces, their hair, their clothing; this is part of the fun of Holi, a national holiday in India.

So we are staying put in our hotel, writing the last of our adventures in India, repacking our gear so it will fit into the limited luggage guidelines of the airlines we'll use tomorrow to fly us home. It is not an exciting day, but necessary. And we knew it would come.

But yesterday was exciting! We went to see the Taj Mahal, fondly called by our guide and driver simply as ""the Taj."" One of the new Seven Wonders of the World, it was built by the emperor Shah Jahan, an impressive tribute to his favorite wife. We left early in the morning to hopefully avoid most of the crowds. It was a long ride from our hotel, over very bad roads. I asked why don't they use some of the money they make from the 50,000 - 60,000 visitors the Taj receives every day to fix the roads? Singhji said that was the million dollar question. So bumping along over the really terrible roads, we finally made it to the parking area; our driver parked the car, and as soon as we alighted there were the vendors, trying to sell us books, bangles, beads, carved elephants, scarves; almost anything you ever wanted as a souvenir was very actively for sale. Singhji directed us to a little bus that took us to the entry of the Taj; foreigners had their own entrance, as did females and males, as we were searched as thoroughly as at any airport security, including a cursory pat down. For the past 3 or 4 years Singhji is no longer allowed to guide his tours through the Taj Mahal, so we were introduced to another official guide, the best one Singhji knew. He was excellent, and we could understand most of what he told us. We spent most of our time there learning about the history of this beautiful building, and walked around the area learning what our guide considered facts. When he finally ushered us inside the building I was surprised at the noise, at the crush of people trying to get inside, all the pushing and shoving, yelling, and forbidden photography; no one is permitted to take photos inside the Taj Mahal, but it seemed we were the only ones who did not. The guards blew their whistles loudly, right into the ears of people, but did not stop those who were taking photographs. Why were they there, if not to enforce their own rules? We couldn't figure that out.

The inside was much smaller and much less impressive than I expected, but perhaps the noise and press of the crowd made it seem less special. The carvings and artwork are exceptionally beautiful, with precious gems given from many countries, but how can one enjoy beauty if people are shoving and pushing and whistles are being blown into your ear? I was disappointed at the inside, and remembered when Princess Diana from Great Britain visited the Taj Mahal; I am sure she had a very different, and much more pleasant, experience.

We soon exited and continued our walk around the buildings; it was better outside and fewer people were there. Singhji says that sometimes it is so crowded that even he does not want to enter the impressive Taj Mahal, as the noise and smell and crush of the masses of people can be overwhelming. And in March it isn't even the high season for visitors!

On our way back to the bus heading back to the parking lot there were hundreds of street vendors trying to sell their wares. The best defense was not to even look at them, not to respond in any way, something I find extraordinarily difficult to do as they keep talking to you, and trying to get you to buy. I really am no good at either haggling or ignoring people, but truly tried. Saying no does not work; they persist, lowering and lowering their prices in hopes of making a sale, even as one is trying to close the car door. Only when we were driving away did they finally give up and go find another tourist.

So that was the Taj Mahal, a gorgeous white marble building that almost every visitor to India must see. The emperor's third --and favorite-- wife, Mumtaj Mahal, inspired its creation but never saw it; she died before it was built. It is worth seeing, in person, but do be prepared for the crush of humanity that will greet you there, most of it not really pleasant.

March 12th 2014

Morning Sunrise on the Ganges
We woke up bright and early the day after my birthday and decided it wasn’t worth moving rooms again - we had originally told Shiva we were moving to Jill and Richards when they left as it was slightly nice and had an aircon, but decided we were happy settled where we were… We told Shiva on the way out. By this stage I was back to my usual Reety happy self. and Shiva promptly told me that I was really nice NOW and good looking when I was happy and smiling lol (I really had been a surly bitch).



We headed down to Open Hand Cafe for breakfast only to find it was shut on Sundays so decided to find OM Cafe which was close by… we found the sign leading down an alley way and spent the next 100 meters dodging cows and cow poo! Right near the door of the cafe, it was almost impossible to avoid the sludge!



We had a nice brunch at OM then headed back to the hotel to get organized for a walking tour we had arranged with Varanasi Walks. As we were walking towards the Ghats
Varanasi Life
I heard Brandon behind me yell out and felt like he was pushing me. I just assumed he had slipped on something. I tried to keep my balance as he pushed me until I saw a cow charging past me and into Taylor! We had all been bowled over by a bloody cow that was obviously in a rush to get to the Ganges for his morning swim! lol



That afternoon we met up with Pappu of Varanasi Walks. We did one of their walks they called Northern Bazaars and Hidden Alleys. We spent the next few hours walking and weaving through cows, traffic, faeces and alleyways. We saw a local flower market and a couple of temples.



Pappu then took us to the Kali temple. It is a temple that comes to life each sunday when people go there to be blessed (and given permission) to be in Varanasi. We were told to leave our shoes in a small alleyway at a little shop and to walk a short distance to the temple. We were horrified that we were going to have to walk barefoot through the alleyways knowing how dirty they are,
Blessed in the temple
but figured it was all part of the experience. We gingerly tiptoed through the alley until we reached a mass crowd of people lining up to get in a small temple door.



We were grabbed by a security guy who led us to the front of the line… Western tourists clearly get special treatment there! We walked in and it was loud and extremely crowded. There was music, and drums being clanged really loudly and all around this temple were holy men doing blessings on people.



Our guide told us he would take us to a specific Holy man that would not try to rip us off and ask for money. On the way there, one Holy guy grabbed me and wiped ash on my forehead before doing some weird blessing where he was hitting my shoulders with a stick. He then put his hand out so I handed him 20rp. He then went OFF at me and demanding more money. I just walked away but I had a feeling he was taking his blessing back and cursing me instead.



We then went to the Holy man the guide had recommended
Its a cows life
and were blessed with orange paint on our foreheads and bracelets on our wrists. After the blessing we left the temple and temporarily lost our guide. After we located him and our shoes we headed off to finish up the walk.



We were taken at the end of the tour by the guide to a restaurant called Keshari. He had recommended it earlier that day and said it served really good food. Taylor was excited as she had read about this place in the Lonely Planet and had it on our list of must dos. We ordered up and Brandon was dismayed to see that it was a Vegetarian restaurant. I ordered a garlic naan and couldn't believe my eyes when it came out and it was literally imbedded with pieces of garlic all over it!



We walked around to Keshari’s second restaurant for dessert just around the corner after we were told they served Kulfi (our favorite dessert). We were a little disappointed as it wasn't as good as previous ones we had eaten and we had really talked it up to Brandon who wasn't impressed with it at all!


Lets say CHEEEEESE



The following morning we headed to Open Hand restaurant for breakfast. We ended up sitting at a table with a couple of other Americans as the place was extremely busy. Unfortunately one of the male staff decided to become infatuated with Taylor and made it extremely uncomfortable to the point she didn't want to come back there after that …. We didn't have much planned for the day so we decided to just wander the back streets and do some shopping for scarves. Varanasi is renowned for its silk scarves.



We found our way to Ba Ba Black Sheep - a silk and pashmina scarf shop recommended for its quality. We were given a lesson in how to tell the difference between real and fake pashmina before settling on some scarves. We decided to try find Blue Lassi after this for a Lassi craving, but got completely and utterly lost and when we eventually found the Ganges river to get our bearings we weren't even close! We gave up as Taylor was starting to feel ill and went back to the hotel.



While Taylor slept I collected our train tickets and then
Kids in Varanasi
decided it was time to buy more Nutella. I then went back to the hotel and ate Nutella for dinner! We had another tour planned with Varanasi Walks for that night but I was starting to feel a little tired and Taylor was still sick then I couldn't find Brandon so I cancelled.



I went down to reception to speak to Shiva about arranging a sunrise boat tour of the Ganges for the following morning and there was an American guy, Travis checking in. He overheard me talking about the boat ride and asked if he could join us. Of course I said yes (it helped that he was EXTREMELY easy on the eye and had a hot accent). I then called it a night and went to bed. Prior to going to bed, I did play Mum with Taylor and make her ginger tea and arrange some plain food from the Guesthouse kitchen to try get her feeling better.



The next morning we started super early at 6am for the sunrise boat ride. Taylor and I were both walking grumpy zombies as we had barking dogs outside our window ALL night. At one
Flower Market
point, Taylor had got up and opened the windows contemplating throwing something at them then realized it wasn't such a great idea… it was seriously the worlds worst torture!



We met Travis and headed off for the boat ride. It was nice but the sunset nothing to write home about as the clouds dampened the sunrise unfortunately. While at the burning ghats we watched an Indian man go off at another tourist who was taking photos. It is extremely disrespectful to take photos of the burning bodies and everyone is told that, but this guy just kept snapping photos… Its people like him that give tourists a bad name.



After the boat ride we were starving so we headed to the rooftop of our guesthouse for Chai and breakfast but they weren't open. We decided to head to Brown Bread Bakery instead and ordered up a feast (way too much food). While we were eating, the monkeys came by for some leftovers. BBB have their rooftop fully enclosed in a cage so the monkeys can’t get to you but some naughty people including Taylor were feeding them through the cage!



After
Our boatman
breakfast Taylor went back to bed so I went walking with Travis. We headed to Open Hand Cafe for coffee then walked along the backstreets trying to find a suitable fabric for him to get a table runner made for his mother. Unsuccessful we made our way to Keshari Restaurant for lunch meeting Taylor there and then we decided to try one last time to find Blue Lassi for a Lassi… these things are famous so we couldn't leave Varanasi without one! We found it and I ordered a chocolate coconut lassi… wow! I can see why they have a good name.. this thing was to die for!



After Blue Lassi we made a dash back to the guesthouse to pack our bags and get to the train station. We had an overnight train to Agra to catch. When we got to the train station it was filthy… we saw that some locals had bought newspapers to sit on the ground on, so when in Rome! We curled up on the newspaper and waited for our train to arrive… Not long before the train turned up a lone cow meandered past slowly on our platform, not a
Let me in!
care in the world… yep this is India!



Once on the train we settled in to our bunks…. a couple of hours into the trip, the random Indian man that was sleeping in the bunk underneath me caught my attention. I looked at him and he pointed at my thongs, basically asking me if he could use them to go to the toilet… I was horrified but as usual good mannered and said yes. I just didn't have the heart to say no! When he got back he flicked them off and they were covered in spots of water (or something else) all over the toe area… URGH! I left it 10 minutes and when I thought he wasn't looking I got down, sat on Brandons bunk and complained miserably to him. Brandon grabbed my thongs from near the mans bed and I used antiseptic wipes to clean them - I then hid them under Brandons bed for the rest of the trip lol



The rest of the train ride was uneventful and it ran late by about an hour arriving to Agra. I was pretty deep asleep upon arrival and it took Taylor
Boats on the Ganges
a few go’s to wake me up… I stumbled out of the train sleepy eyed and carrying my 17kg backpack, ready to see the Taj Mahal….

March 4th 2014
Published: March 6th 2014


Snake Charmer eeeeek
We made the long windy descent to the airport early in the morning... By the time we hit the bottom my ears were really hurting. I'd had a cold for a few days and my ears were definitively feeling the altitude difference. It got me slightly worried about our flights, especially since we had two flights to do that day to get to Varanasi. We stopped halfway for a toilet break and there was a large evil looking monkey sitting near the car. I decided to hold on until the airport. While taylor was in the toilet I got out to try snap a photo of the monkey but he quickly saw that as an invitation to come closer so I jumped back into the car. He then proceeded to jump onto the car next to us and start playing with the drivers side mirror almost snapping it off.



When we arrived at Bagdogra airport, we had breakfast while we waited to check in. When checking opened, I went to put my bag through a. X-ray machine and was extremely nervous when they pulled me aside and asked me to open my bag! I bought my protein powder
My birthday dinner
all packed into little individual sandwich bags to India,so thought maybe they were going to question me about that! Instead it turned out that my mosquito repellant was a dangerous article (deodorants etc ok but mosquito repellant not). I pouted and was sad as I had two cans equalling almost $30! The guy checking my bag must have fallen for the pout as he told me that he would let it through, before putting security tape around the lid. He then told me to remove before any more flights so that he didn't get in any trouble for letting it through! Lol



Once checked in, we casually made our way to the departure lounge. It was really unclear where we should be boarding and what time, and alot of flights had been delayed that morning due to the fog. We saw a flight boarding for Jet Airways and asked someone. They told us that it was the Delhi Flight... We sat down, plugged Taylors phone into the wall and she went off to the toilet... I had been sitting there maybe 5-10 minutes and I heard a 'last call for Kolkata' over the loud speaker....
The Ghats
I suddenly panicked wondering if we were meant to be boarding. I could see that there was a Jet Airways plane on the tarmac and all the 'Delhi' passengers had finished boarding. I couldnt really move, as Taylor was still in the toilet and I had all our luggage and her phone in the wall socket etc. I quickly asked a couple sitting nearby who said ""No that is the Jet Airways plane to Kolkata boarding"". I went into complete panic mode, furiously gathering up Taylors phone and stuffing it in my open bag and grabbing all our stuff... I ran for the gate and was hysterically saying to them ""Is that Kolkata Jet Airways"" and they are saying ""Yes you must board now' and I was almost screaming ""I can't, my friend is still in the toilet"". I then heard our names being called over the loud speaker and then I completely lost it... lol I was like ""please wait, I need to find my friend"" and I'm thinking to myself ""Why is she STILL in the toilet?!""



I told them to please wait and I bolted for the toilets, I ran in screaming at Taylor
Images from the Ghats
like a mad woman.... ""WE NEED TO GO NOW"" and there she is, calmly plaiting her hair in the mirror! She looks at me like I am a monster and says ""Whats wrong??"" and I was possessed ""OUR PLANE IS LEAVING NOW"" and she still calmly looks at me and says ""No that was the Delhi plane"" and I am beside myself ""NO..... its our plane, they are calling our names on the loudspeaker"". At that moment, she kicks into panic gear and starts bolting towards me. I threw her bags at her and we ran for the gate. When we got there, they were all like ""you have to run"" so there we are, bolting across the tarmac towards the plane... and when we get on, yes we are THOSE annoying people that the whole plane is sitting there waiting for! Such a close call!



Our flight to Kolkata was pretty uneventful apart from some extreme pain in my easy at descent, but I had dosed up on antihistamines and painkillers so it was bearable. I wasn't looking forward to another descent though.we had a quick food stop in Kolkata before boarding our plane for Varanasi.
Taylor playing with snakes




Walking to the plane in Kolkata, I was dismayed to see we were boarding a small-ish twin propellor plane (My worst nightmare)... Once on the plane to Varanasi, we settled in for the flight. We have had an amusing time everywhere we go, where we ask for something on the menu and the answer is ALWAYS ""we no have"". We end up asking for 3-4 things before giving up and saying ""Ok WHAT DO YOU HAVE?"" lol Once again, no disappointment.... I asked for something to eat and it was the standard ""we no have"".... ""ok what do you have"" before settling on the corn chips and salsa (named Nachos on the menu).



A little while later, after admiring the view of the sunny day outside, the pilot announced we were about to descend and asked the air hostesses to take their seats. He promptly plunged us into some dark, thick clouds that werent there a minute ago.... We then circled and circled and circled in the cloud for the next half hour. I was absolutely TERRIFIED.... and panicked even more when I saw Taylor get bored and take out her phone to play
Floppy Bithday To Me!
with (Not in Airplane Mode). I was beside myself... LOL. Taylor's Dad is a Pilot so she has no worries, but I was almost in tears as our landing took over half an hour of bumps, dark clouds and no end is sight. I seriously thought I would not see my 40th Birthday the following day. When the airport came in sight I was sooooo grateful! lol



We made our way to find a taxi and met up with an Aussie couple, Richard and Jill who just happened to be staying at the same guesthouse ... seriously what are the chances?! We shared a taxi with them to the guesthouse. Varanasi is based around the River Ganges and the Lonely Planet describes it the best ""Brace Yourself. You're about to enter one of the most blindingly colorful, unrelentingly chaotic and unapologetically indiscreet places on earth. Varanasi takes no prisoners. But if you're ready for it, this may just turn out to be your favorite stop of all.""



Varanasi has been known as Kashi (city of life) and Benares and is one of the worlds oldest continually inhabited cities. It is regarded as one of
I found Nutella in a back street on my birthday!
Hinduism's seven holy cites. Pilgrims come here to the ghats of the River Ganges to wash away a lifetime of their sins in the sacred waters and also to cremate their loved ones. It is a auspicious place to die. Dying here is said to offer 'moksha' - liberation from the cycle of life and death. Varanasi is said to be the beating heart of the Hindu Universe. The most intimate rituals of life and death take place in public and as the Lonely Planets says 'its a magical place, but not for the faint hearted .. the sights, sounds and smells in and around the ghats ... can be overwhelming'



The taxi dropped us off at the main road and a guy met the taxi to then show us how to get to our guesthouse. It had only stopped raining a short time before so the alleyways leading to the guesthouse were full of mud ... and unprepared I was in my thongs (flip flops for those thinking I am talking a pair of underwear and not shoes). I was later to discover, once it had dried, that the ""mud"" I was walking through was in
Goats everywhere
fact a nice mix of dirt, human urine and faeces from dogs, goats, cows and humans! Charming! Taylor, Jill and Richard all had hiking boots on so they were ok! It was dark, crowded, wet, smelly and windy... and I was carrying 16kg on my back and 7 kg on my front. I was one unhappy camper by the time we made it to the guesthouse 10 minutes later! lol



When we arrived at the Guesthouse, Shiva, our host, appeared to be unorganised and not expecting us. Jill and Richard showed him their reservation and were shown to what was meant to be our room. When I showed him my reservation, he seemed a little uneasy (given he had just given someone our room we booked) and so showed us to another room which was not what I had paid for.... It was the straw that broke the camels back so to speak, and I spat it. I was extremely rude to him about it and was told that it was the only room but we could either A) swap with Jill and Richard or B) move the next day... I reluctantly agreed to take another room
Ghat Selfie
the next day but I was really disappointed, especially when I saw their room a little while later and it was extremely cute and just what I wanted! They offered to swap but I didn't want to put them out so sucked it up... I was still in a bad mood however when we met them on the rooftop for dinner. I was feeling extremely homesick at this point, maybe a lot due to it being my birthday the next day. I quickly ate my dinner then left the table saying I wasn't feeling so well and was going to bed.



I went downstairs to the room and started crying. I was so homesick and felt like shit. I cried myself to sleep and Taylor was kind enough to tuck me in when she came to bed later on. The next morning I woke up bright and early... It was my birthday! Taylor was still sleeping so I let her be, and walked up to the rooftop to have a Chai and wait for her to rise. Shiva was up there and was being extremely nice to me but I was still a little dirty with him
Varanasi Kids asking for their photo to be taken
about the rooms. It helped to brighten my mood when he served me a big steaming mug of Masala Chai Tea.... and it was the best I had tasted so far... I drank my Chai while speaking to my parents on the phone and watching the monkeys on the adjoining rooftops play around...



Taylor made her way up a short time later and after wishing me a big happy birthday we decided to head out and explore.. We spoke to Shiva about changing rooms and he showed us a room similar to Jill and Richards. It wasn't as good but a close second so we decided to move there and think about moving into Jill and Richards the next day when they left. The bathroom was disgusting covered in mould but I didn't care at that point.



We wound our way through the smelly alleyway a short distance to the River Ganges. The River Ganges is lined with Ghats for miles (Ghats being the stairs that lead down to the water) and it was a sight to be seen. There were people bathing in the water, washing clothes and buffalos next to each other,
Monkeys on the rooftops
there were boats everywhere, touts trying to sell boat rides, kids trying to sell souviniers and washing hanging everywhere... beautiful saris, next to bed sheets, next to tourists clothes... and Ghats as far as the eye could see.... As you walk along the Ghats are named. We were staying at Munshi Ghat.



After taking it all in, we decided to head south down the river to Assi Ghat and find a restaurant for breakfast. We walked along and halfway we met a young American Artist named David. We invited him to brunch and wound up at Open Hand Cafe near Assi Ghat. It was a great little cafe that served awesome coffee and I quickly became addicted to their Coffisch which was like a cappucino but had some honey and Indian spices added... sooooo good. We hung around the cafe for a few hours, blogging, catching up on internet and chatting. David left after awhile and we continued to chill at the Cafe. The cafe also sold scarves and others bits n bobs, and I cleaned up buying a stack of their scarves! When I ordered a yummy shake, Taylor arranged for it to come out on
Washing clothes at the Ghats
a plate with Happy Birthday written on the plate! Very sweet (even though it looked like it said Floppy not Happy and they spelt Birthday wrong!) lol



We eventually left the Cafe (Taylor paid for my breakfast as a birthday present which was super sweet of her) and wandered back along the Ghats taking photos. We made our way into the alley ways and stumbled on a small stall which Taylor happened to spot a large jar of Nutella. I was soooo excited that I bought it on the spot for 220rp. We went back to the room to chill out and eat nutella from the jar. Heaven!



We were meeting Richard and Jill for dinner and also Brandon, the guy I had met on Lonely Planet. We had arranged to go to Brown Bread Bakery (try saying that out aloud a couple of times) and so I had a shower and decided to blow dry my hair... it was important to look nice on my 40th after all.... about 5 minutes into blow drying my hair the power went out... it then went back on but as soon as I started up my
Ghat beauty
hairdryer a 2nd time, it went out again! My hairdryer was blowing the electricity in the guesthouse! I was so upset! lol All I wanted was nice hair for my birthday dinner. I reluctantly tied it back and we met everyone to head to dinner.



We had dinner sitting on cushions on the floor and there was live music each night at the Bakery, so we settled in to eat dinner and listen to the music. Unfortunately we didnt realise that people turn up specifically to watch the live music and while we were attempting to be social and chat (not very loudly mind you) we had 3 French women lay into us telling us to stop talking. We were a little disappointed since we were there to have dinner and socialise.



At the end of the music set, the Musicians came around trying to sell a CD. Richard told them to ask the French ladies since they were really into the music (tongue in cheek of course) and that was it, the French ladies overhearing him went psycho! lol Richard and Jill ended up having words with the French ladies while we sat
buffalo time!
there laughing. The French ladies were extremely rude but left soon after. Richard and I were the only ones to have dessert and then we left to walk back to the guesthouse in the dark. I was in bed asleep by about 10pm! It was a lovely night and I was extremely grateful to be surrounded by new friends for the day.

Travelling around India, I often have absolutely no idea what's going on. Each week, I try to post a new mystery - something I saw that I just don't get. You online readers may have a better chance discovering the mystery with your speedy online connection than I have while trying to communicate my questions here in India. Here is this week's mystery:

When I first heard it, I didn't think much of it.

Walking down a street in Jaiselmir, Rajastan, I passed yet another street tout, this guy selling flutes. He played a familiar song that I knew well - but I didn't quite place it, trying instead to ignore him so that he would ignore me (it's worth a hope).

By the time we got to Goa, the tune was inescapable. Walking down the beach in Arambol, dozens of touts roamed the streets selling flutes and drums. And all the flute sellers knew the same tune.

""That sounds an awful lot like that song..."" I thought at first. ""But it can't be."" It seems so out of place in the warm tropical Indian city or beach, so far from the iceburg-strewn waters of the Atlantic Ocean. But eventually it became unistakable.

The Titanic Song - My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion.

I've heard it played on the lips of innumerable flute touts, as well as in CD shops playing Indian music. And tonight, I heard it played live at my restaurant, Brown Bread Bakery in Varanasi. Amidst a dozen or so traditional Indian songs on the flute, the unmistakale tune brought me back to that great passion that ended so heartbrakenly.

So is this tune a traditional Indian melody that got borrowed to put Leo and Kate's heartbreak into song, or an instantly recognizable tune by foreigners that Indian musicians use to relate to tourists?

Taj Mahal
Agra
Needless to say that the visit to the Taj Mahalwas one of the highlights of our trip. I can tell you that it was not a disappointment indeed! What an excitement to see one of the most beautiful buildings of the world with my own eyes. These experiences are the reasons why I travel.

The best time to visit the Taj Mahal is early in the morning when the sun is rising. At that moment you can see color change of the marble. There was some fog the morning when we wanted to go, so we visited the Taj around noon. If you see pictures of the Taj Mahal, you can't imagine that the surroundings are so big. You pass a gate and gardens before you can see the Taj Mahal. There are two mosques besides the Tajal Mahal. There are two routes to the Taj Mahal: one -long route- for the ""General ticket holders"" and a -short- route for the ""High value ticket holders"". This was not the first time in India when we noticed these differences...

The Taj Mahal was built by Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife. So it must have been a
Bazaar at night
Agra
torture for him that he was put under house arrest by his son Aurangzeb at the Agra Fort, from where he could see the Taj Mahal. After the dead of Shah Jahan, he was buried in the mausoleum next to his wife. It is an impressive fort. Inside there were beautiful flowers. Our local guide told us that in the ancient days there were crocodiles in the canals defending the fort.

As elsewhere on our trip in India, the bazaars were full of life. Camels, monkeys, honking, hundreds of electrical wires, cycle-rickshaws,... You name it! Funny to see the warning in our hotel: ""Don't open the window because of the monkeys""

A nice change for the crowded environment was the visit of the Keoladeo Ghana National Park. With the help of a guide, we explored the park on a bicycle. Though we didn't see a cobra (apparently there are cobra's in the park), we managed to see a boa constrictor.

Taj Mahal
And to Agra we go…

So Maddy and I took the train out of Delhi, bound Southeast for Agra, the city that was the Mughal capital for a decent amount of time back in the day. Oh, and is home to the Taj Mahal. It also is home to a heck of a lot of horses, cows, and rickshaw drivers wanting to carry you 200 metres down the street.



So we arrived mid-day, and found our hotel. Then, instead of going straight to the Taj, in the heat of the day and the heat of the tour group explosion in the Wonder of the World, we checked out some of the other sights in Agra, yes, there are other things to see there.



So we hitched a tuk tuk driver to put-put us around for the afternoon, hitting the highlights, first up was a visit to the Baby Taj, which does have a real name, but is generally just known as the Baby Taj. This lovely mausauleum was the tomb of a predecessor of Shah Jahan, who built the Taj. So the Baby Taj came first, was built to be a gorgeous monument, and
Taj Mahal
then Shah Jahan came along and said, “Nah, I’m going to outdo you in the final resting place race, I see you Baby Taj and raise you a Massive Taj!” Ancient pissing contest of sorts. But we really liked the Baby Taj, as it was gorgeous, set right on the side of the river, and had a heck of a lot less tourists meandering around.

Taj Mahal
The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Wikipedia Address: आगरा, उत्तर प्रदेश 282001 Height: 171 m Architectural style: Mughal architecture Architects: Ustad Ahmad Lahouri, Ustad Isa Burials: Arjumand Banu, Shah Jahan Function: Monument, Mausoleum
Dear Lord today was amazing...

Took a flight from Pune to New Dehli. When I arrived in New Delhi I was meeting a friend and he still had not arrived yet so I waited in the baggage area for a while before deciding to go get a room at the Airport Lounge. Part of this decision was because there was no where to sit, the other part was because of the guys with machine guns chilling in the airport. It was chilly in New Delhi and the Baggage area was open. It was getting late and things were getting a bit sketchy and I was getting tired. (According to rules and such, not allowed to stay in Delhi, nor were we allowed to leave the airport because the fog was so heavy it was unsafe to drive. When I say fog, I do mean bad FOG. The kind where you can't see two feet in front of you when you are walking kind-of-bad, considering the traffic situation in India anyway, it was safer to stay at the airport then try to get the driver to take us to Agra in the morning. I crashed out in the backseat of the
Agra Fort
Agra Fort, is a monument, a UNESCO World Heritage site located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city
car on the way to Agra because I had not slept yet. I woke up at some point during the trip and we were parked against this building, and I had a mild freak-out of ""where the hell was I"" moment, but it turns out the driver just had to use the restroom, and we were still on our way to Agra.





We arrive in Agra to this BEAUTIFUL hotel. (ITC Mughal if you ever are in Agra, I suggest a stay here.) It is more like a fort/castle thing with amazing gardens and pools and beauty everywhere. I could walk around outside all day and never get bored. They have this lookout tower you can climb to see the Taj Mahal. Apparently it is only open from 7 am to 7pm, but my friend and I REALLY wanted to see it one night so we were sneaking all over this hotel trying to find different ways up to the tower, even though it was closed. Sure way to make me do anything is to tell me that I ""can't"". We would walk through gardens and hide from guards and try every path imaginable.
Agra Fort

Sorry, got off topic with the hotel thing there... So back to Agra. After we checked in we went to Agra Fort. This place was so incredible. We didn't want a guide so we just kept speaking Spanish to each other until the ""not-a-guides"" would leave us alone. There were monkeys crawling all over the place. I have a ton of pictures of them eating apples and joking and playing. The Fort was amazing. I didn't really stop to read the signs that explained a whole lot of detail about the fort but I did climb in every nook and crevice I could find. This fort had about a million and one court yards that seemed to stretch on forever. If you want to see more of it, I'm sure you can Google it, or just look at the pictures at the end of the blog. There are some funny pictures and Videos of the monkeys at the fort if I ever get around to uploading them. At one point, J pointed out in Spanish about monkeys being somewhere and I am looking all around and we were being hassled by this ""not-a-guide"" and finally he says ""MIRA AQUI"" and
Chipmunks!
I look to my right and there are three monkeys not even two feet from me.

Cinderella story: My favorite part of the fort was that there were these little chipmunk things running around and these guys were calling them over and feeding them crackers. They put some in J's hand and once I realized it was safe, I did the same. They poured crackers in my hand and a chipmunk climbs on up and starts eating out of my hands. Then another guy hands me ANOTHER chipmunk. I seriously felt like Cinderella where she has all the mice and animals around her getting dressed. It was a cute moment, here's a short video... not going to lie, you can tell by the look on my face I'm kind of afraid they are going to bite me or scratch me and I didn't want to make any sudden movements.. just don't make fun of me, here's the vid; [ ]







After feeding the Animals we crawled ALL OVER that fort. It was amazing, the architecture and just the idea that that was someones living quarters. J and I walked around pretending we lived
Agra Fort
there, saying ""oh this is the armory, this is the dining room, this is the courtyard for blah blah blah"" I just can't imagine using that much space for a living center. I would have loved it. So many places to hide, and so many roofs. When we were done with the Agra Fort J and I went to the Taj Mahal. We took a horse drawn carriage up the hill to the East Gate of the Taj and walked in. I don't really have words for the Taj Mahal. It is more beautiful than words can describe and more spectacular than any picture could ever capture. But that is not what makes it special. What makes it special is the love story behind it. I don't think you can enjoy the Taj without knowing the story behind it. I'll do my best to give you a quick rundown of the story, but I won't be able to do it justice.



The Taj Story: Maharajah Shah Jahan spotted Mumtaz Mahal at the marketplace in his royal complex. It was love at first sight for the two, and he quickly made her his third wife.He gave her unlimited
The Taj
power in ruling the empire. She was said to be the most loving and wise woman, and Mumtaz gave her unlimiteded power in signing royal decrees. Mumtaz traveled with Shah Jahan throughout India, as his chief companion and beloved advisor. After bearing him 14 children, Mumtaz died, leaving the Maharajah devastated. He then decided to build her an everlasting memorial and resting place, looking to the Koran for inspiration. Taking inspiration from its detailed description of Heaven, Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal To ensure that no other living structure would ever rival the beauty of the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan made an agreement with the building’s artist In exchange for life security, they would not create anymore art or design in their lifetime. To this day we hear the saying, that Shah Jahan “cut off the hands of the artists” so that nothing as beautiful would ever be built.

A pretty good love story don't you think? And still a better love story than twilight.

At the Taj Mahal, there is a museum in there that had this really cool plate that I don't want to forget. Apparently it was used to detect poison because if poison
Beautiful
was placed on the plate, (like poisonous food and such) then the plate would change colors and shatter. Totally worth mentioning and remembering.

For lunch J and I split a 2 person special at a restaurant, but we had so much food it was ridiculous. I ate until I was so full that it hurt. There was saffron rice, butter chicken, and a bunch of stuff that I cannot name but was amazing. oh, and Naan. You can't forget Naan. As we were leaving the restaurant, J mentions to me to look over and right on my right is a friggin SNAKE CHARMER. I'm talking old dude with flute looking this with a COBRA in his lap. We watched him for a few minutes and J goes up and HOLDS the basket that is holding the cobra. Ridiculous. When it was my turn I was not brave enough to hold the snake so I got as close as I felt I could then smiled to the camera. I'm all for an adrenaline rush, but come on people, this was a friggin Cobra in the middle of India. No way was I going to hold the damn thing.

So
Horse drawn carts
after the cobra incident we went to a dance/bollywood/show thing that told the love story of the Taj Mahal with acting and dancing and singing. It was magical... Purely Magical. These girls were so pretty and the outfits glowed with magic. It was like watching real life fairies dance across the stage. Every outfit was fantastic and every element hit you in the gut with awe. I got the feels once or twice during the show, and it is a must see if you go to Agra. I snuck the go pro in so here's a clip of some of the dancing but if you really want to see it, go to Agra and ask for the Kalakriti show. Truly amazing.

[ ]

The next day J and I took a hot air balloon up to see the Taj from a different point of view. The fog had set and we didn't see much but it was cool to be in a helium balloon above the Taj Mahal. We were able to see lots of farm land and landmarks and it was fun being that high up. I'll get pictures as soon as I get the email with them.
Snake Charmer


On the way back to New Delhi, (we stopped at a carpet shop and saw how they were made. It takes 5 months to make a large carpet and the loomer only makes 70-90 rupees a day to make these silk/wool carpets. They change colors when the light hits them because the loomer places the knots at a 60 degree angle, so that at one side when looking its dark, and the other, it reflects light.) After we bought a magic carpet I watched them package it up. It may not seem like much to you but it was fascinating. Two men folded the carpet (this was a rather large carpet) and then wrapped it in a blue weather proof tarp thing, and sewed it shut. Then they took another sort of cloth and hand stitched around the blue tarp to make a bag. They did this all while we were having a conversation with another one of the store people. J also had a couple of shirts made while we were waiting. NO joke. I saw him pick out the fabric and they took his measurements and not an hour later they were done.

J and I
dont get the Taj dirty
went to a park that overlooks the backside of the Taj Mahal. We were walking around looking at the garden and plants and a group of kids came and surrounded us, asking for ""photos"". They love for you to take their pictures, then turn it for them to see. It really is cute. The cool part about this story, and the reason I am telling you about the park is because something happened in the park. I was sitting on a bench, and J was taking my photo so I left my stuff on the ground next to him and walked over to the bench to sit. Now I have already mentioned the kids and their love for the camera so they started to get right by my bag, near J to see the photo. This group of kids had one older girl, most likely 11ish, and the rest were all 3,4, 5 year olds. One of the smaller kids was interested in my bag, and started to go towards it. My mind went off that ""holy crap they are going to steal it!"" because these kids were hungry and had been asking for money when they saw us. What
I saw other people doing selfies, thought i should too
happened next I will never forget. The older girl, again, only 11 years old max, pulled the child away from my things and got after him like a mother would to her own child. That young girl had enough respect for me/herself/morals/karma to forget how hungry and cold she was and not take my stuff. Looking back i wish I would of had the decency to buy her a proper meal. See, that's the thing that transpires over every continent in every culture, the innocence and honesty of children..



We grabbed our goodies and set off for New Delhi to catch the plane in the morning. The driver stopped at a truck stop and we had tea with him and tried our best to cross communication boundary and ask where his family was from. We invited him to dinner, and I got him to say yes, but I think the cultural differences of the Cast system or work related issues made it very uncomfortable for him, so he said he was sorry and that he would not be eating with us. I feel so bad that I made him uncomfortable. I just wanted to be human to
our horse
human with him.



Alright folks, I'm going to end the blog here, but I did want to mention that I have noticed a certain hospitality here in India that I wish everyone could experience. I have felt so much love and respect since I got here that it almost puts Southern Hospitality to shame. I wasn't really prepared for when people said that part of your heart stays in India, but I get it now. They did not mean the physical place, or maybe they did, but what really makes India so amazing is all of the people I have come into contact with. I have never felt so welcomed in a foreign country as India has made me feel. -okay, I'll end the feels here, Have fun looking at pictures and I'll blog in a few days when I go do some more random stuff. MUCH LOVE

Taj Mahal
13th December

If we thought Jodphur was an assault on our senses, we quickly realised that it was just a trial warm up for Agra. The city is famous for the Taj Mahal which is beautiful but the city is mad, mad, mad and the outskirts are filthy. Animals everywhere foraging through loads of litter and debris, dust everywhere and everything seemed brown, grim and brown. The traffic was awful with really bad bottle necks made worse as a buffalo had decided to die and they were trying to haul it out of the way. We crossed over the river with a view of the little Taj and made our way to the park where the Maharajah was going to build the black Taj, on the opposite side of the river Yamoona to the Taj Mahal where his favourite wife is buried and this gave us some lovely views of the Taj Mahal itself. She died after giving birth to her 14th child, he locked himself away for several weeks and emerged with grey hair, a much older man. He ended up being imprisoned by his own son but was allowed to be buried to the side of his wife

in the Taj Mahal.

Our hotel for the night was very swanky, right in the middle of town, it really is such a contrast from the chaos outside to the serenity inside and of course the luxury and comfort inside to the poverty and sadness in the street.

Our clothes, being made in Jaipur were coming to the hotel tonight, he arrived at about 10pm, what we didn't realise was this lovely young chap who brought them had come by bus, 6 hours.... And he had to go straight back, another 6 hours.



They had made a good job of most of it but Sals trousers were too long and the jacket was too big in various places.



14th December

Our city guide arrived for the tour, we reckoned he would be a bit of an Indian Delboy but had good English and liked a joke, we asked him about the amount of men/boys we saw walking about holding hands, there were far too many for all of them to be gay, and he explained it was just friendship and was seen as perfectly ok whereas opposite sexes showing affection in
Swanky Hotel Doormen at Agra
public could be frowned on, he summed it up by saying in England you can kiss but not piss and in India you can piss but not kiss! Mr Harinder was interested in the clothes that had been delivered and showing him the jacket, Del boy Amit knew exactly where to go and within about an hour the jacket was refitted and trousers taken up! This is India, everything is possible!

The Taj Mahal was fabulous, crowded with people so we didn't get a Princess Diana moment but Delboy knew all the photoshots and where to take them, plus he knew his stuff. It is such a beautiful building, the marble is inlaid with carnelian,lapis lazuli, jasper, mother of pearl and various other stones and is perfectly crafted. When you go inside, you put covers on your shoes. Inside are the tombs which are in the basement, now closed to the public, so replicas have been made at ground level. It would be nice to walk around in peace and calm, but it's the opposite, people shouting, guards shouting louder and constantly blowing whistles.... Awful, dreadful atmosphere.

Every tourist attraction has loads of touts selling tut of all
Taj Reflection
types, to get them off our backs we say, later, later, they always reply, ok I see you when you finish visit, my name is Raj ok, you remember me. Outside the Taj Mahal his name was Bobby so Pete had to buy something !

Next we visited the Red Fort, built by same chap as Taj Mahal, some of the carvings in the various colours sandstones was stunning.

South Indians at the bathing ghats
Accommodation - Radisson Hotel

Weather - Hot & sunny 28C

What an experience Varanasi was!! We thought we had already seen much that India had to throw at us - but no not at all. Varanasi is India on steroids - chaotic, manic, frenetic, noisy - everything we had experienced but greatly magnified - but that is what Varanasi is all about!

The sunrise boat trip on the Ganges was sensational - just as we had imagined - viewing the bathing ghats, pilgrims from all over India and the world ritually cleansing themselves in the holy Ganges river. Colourful temples, bright lights and spiritual chantings reflecting across the Ganges with the sunrise casting a peaceful orange light across the water.

Would you want your clothes washed at the 'dhobi ghats'? - I think not - knowing what is floating in the river!

In the evening we joined the masses swarming along the narrow alleys down towards the River Ganges to witness the Ganga Aarti Ceremony on the Dasaswamedh Ghats. This ceremony, performed every night is part of the evening prayers. What a colourful, noisy spiritual experience with ringing bells, chantings, clouds of incense and numerous small
Sunrise over the Ganges
deeyas (floating oil lamps) offered by devotees to Mother Ganga floating down the river.

That was that - our wonderful, exciting, interesting tour of Rajasthan and Varanasi is over - we fly back to the cold of Britain tomorrow. We have loved India and will hopefully be back sometime in the future.

First view of the Taj Mahal throught the entrance archway
Note Alison, 3rd from left, in the first group with no-one else in front of the Mausoleum
A very early start today, 05.15, for a very special reason - our visit to the Taj Mahal. A short ride in the bus, a walk through almost deserted streets for 200m before arriving at the gated entrance. Our tour group were at the head of the queue, only 1 hour to wait for the gates to be opened. Strict security checks, before entering the complex, a short walk down an avenue before turning into the main entrance and there before our eyes was the amazing spectacle of the Taj Mahal! sparkling and glowing white in the early morning light. Wow and wow again - a privilege to be here and see with our own eyes this amazing Mausoleum dedicated to love. We were in the first group of six, unbelievelable, no crowds in front of us for the first 10 minutes - pictures of the Taj Mahal in its pure and pristine elegance. Walking around the Taj Mahal you appreciate its total symmetry, you can see the extensive intricate carving in the marble, the Pietra dura - flower designs of inlaid semi-precious stones in the marble. The Mausoleum was built by Shah Jamal for his wife following her death. Undoubtably

Note no-one else in the picture!!
the highlight of the tour but there are going to be many other wonderful sights and experience in the days to come.

Back to the hotel for a late breakfast and then straight off to visit Agra Fort - there is going to be no rest on this holiday but we don't mind when we are seeing all these amazing sights.

Agra Fort is situated on the west bank of the Yamuna river and was built, in red sandstone, by the mughal Emperor Akbar between 1565 and 1573. We enter through the imposing Amar Singh Gate and beyond opens up a complex arrangement of halls, marble palaces, mosques, courtyards, galleries and dungeons.

We then crossed the river for a short drive to the Tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah often referred to as the ""baby Taj"". The tomb was built by the Empress Noor Jahan in memory of her father. This was an exquisite building, thought to be the forerunner of the Taj Mahal. It has been described as a ""jewel box in marble"" and it certainly is with combinations of white marble, coloured mosaics, stone inlays and lattice work.

We have the long drive to Jaipur tomorrow.

Agra Fort
Taking the train from Delhi was a relatively painless experience, with comfy seats and even a mostly edible breakfast thrown in. It would also turn out to be the best transport I ever took in India, by a long shot.



I lost my Brasillian friends from Delhi when we arrived at Agra, the solitary nature of my adventure becoming instantly more apparent. Fortunately I quickly found a new travel buddy: a friendly Belgian girl called Louise, who was a dancer on her way to Cambodia. She was to be my next door neighbour at the new hotel I'd checked into: Hotel Sheela. Checking in was also a brilliant experience for me, as I'd made no booking at all. I was just a lone man, on the road, who rocked up out of nowhere and asked for a room (Thanks to a Lonely Planet recommendation mind you). I've never done this before, and found it quite liberating! Maybe it's the fact that nobody in the world knew where I was, or maybe I just enjoy the impulsiveness, but either way there's an immense sense of freedom that goes along with it. Considering my itinerary for the trip was literally a
My New Travel Buddy, Louise
Outside the Baby Taj
hastily scrawled list of place names I'd got from recommendations on Facebook a couple of weeks prior, it was something I'd quickly become accustomed to. If you're planning on doing India around this time of year, I'd highly recommend it.



My new Belgian friend had arranged a tour with a driver, Sahib, and offered me a place in the car. At 650 Rupees (£6.50) for the both of us, how could I refuse? The first thing we saw was Agra Fort, which in my opinion was way better than the Red Fort in Delhi. It's somewhat less dilapidated, and gives a bigger glimpse into Persian Mughal life, being their royal residence from the 1500s onwards. But most exciting was that we spotted the Taj Mahal from a window, which made my heart skip a beat. This is no coincidence though, seeing as the Taj was built as a mausoleum for the wife of one of the Mughal rulers that lived in the Red Fort, and he wanted to watch over her. Romantic, right?



The next stop was affectionately called the ""Baby Taj"", though actually the Tomb of I'timād-ud-Daulah. I was slowly building my way up to seeing
A Girl Riding a Herd of Cows
Standard.
the actual Taj, and the suspense was palpable. The baby version could easily be a draft copy, though impressive in its own right, and very Persian. It must have been amazing back in the day.



The scenery on our drive was interesting enough, what with all the people going about their business, sacred cows, and the obligatory goats that were being sold for Muslim Eid. There also happened to be a 9-day festival going on (Navratri), which was everywhere, and it was relentless. We drove past multiple groups of people throwing coloured powder in the air whilst dancing themselves into a frenzy. Part of the festival also involves giving away free food, and we had kids running up to our car passing free food through the windows - bowls made of leaves with little chapatti things that had sweet or savoury filling. They were actually quite tasty, but also came with a side of humility. Here I was, practically a millionaire next to some of these people, and they were happily handing me free food. I'm sure there's a lesson in there somewhere, especially as it wouldn't be the only time I experienced this in India. I

quickly snapped out of my humble reverie when Sahib, our driver, decided to pull a fast one on us by saying it was 650 rupees each, which clearly wasn't what we agreed on. We ended up just getting out and walking away. Uncomfortable is a feeling you get a lot of when you're new to India, and Sahib had definitely made me feel uncomfortable - Especially as he had been crudely flirting with Louise the whole way, even asking her to a Bollywood film the next day! What a creep.



The early start and oppressive heat had got the better of us, so after a tactical afternoon nap we spent the rest of the day checking out the rooftop restaurants, lots of which overlook the Taj. We befriended a couple of Israeli girls in the process, one of whom was an intelligence officer, which was interesting! (Also interesting was that due to her religious beliefs she wasn't allowed to willingly make any physical contact with a man. I kept poking her with my spoon, just for kicks. I'm like that.)



The next day was a complete whirlwind, and possibly the most exciting on the
The Taj Mahal!!
Every bit as amazing as I'd hoped.
trip. It started with a 5am wakeup. On a Monday. Whilst this would normally be the approximate equivalent of a strong kick to the groin, this was no ordinary Monday! I was going to the Taj Mahal - Something I've wanted to see since I was just a wee lad reading up on the 7 wonders of the world. And it didn't disappoint. The first thing that struck me was just how massive the thing is. Not to mention the courtyard and outer courtyard, which could easily be major tourist attractions by themselves, even though they still pale in comparison to the mausoleum itself. We were lucky enough to be the first people to get to the Taj, and got photos without without the masses in front. It felt so much more majestic and personal to have the place to ourselves!



After eventually tearing ourselves away from the Taj, we had a breakfast of curried potatoes, chapattis, and some sugary things that were reminiscent of Koeksisters from South Africa. This would be my 8th curry in a row, in just over 2 days, but I wasn't tired of it yet! The kid that served us reckoned, through the
Breakfast Curry with Louise
With my hair-twin waiter.
medium of charades and broken English, that I was his hair twin, which made me laugh.



I went off on my own to buy some train tickets to Jaipur, my next destination. Simple task, but it turned into a massive ball-ache. For starters I mistakenly caught a cycle-rickshaw, which is decidedly slower than a motorised one. I also got talked into using a travel agent rather than the train station, for which the driver no doubt got commission. I figured I'd save some hassle, but I was wrong. They told me I had to wait half an hour for the booking, which was enough time for the driver to take me to a shop! How convenient. As I'd handed over my money already, I begrudgingly accepted, and spent the rest of the time evading a hard sell on hand-woven carpets. I made it easier by announcing on arrival that I wouldn't buy anything. I finally got my ticket, and made the slow journey back into town with a cyclist that needed a drink stop and a tyre pressure check on the way. It was unbearably hot, so I don't blame him.



And then the
Festivities Line the Streets
crazy started.



We passed one of the many groups celebrating the 9-day festival, which usually comprises of a truck with loudspeakers and a bunch of rowdy dancing people throwing coloured powder everywhere. My cycle-driver insisted that we stop and join in, and though hesitant, I agreed. I was welcomed ecstatically into the mob with a handshake from everyone, as I instantly became the resident celebrity, and danced in the middle of a circle of excited people that were imitating my moves, all the while getting splattered with coloured powder. I was just getting into my newfound stardom when an angry looking guy came up to me, yelling at me to leave. Everyone else seemed to be oblivious to angry guy, and continued to smile and shake my hand around him. I took the hint anyway and left. My cycle-driver told me that the man was worried that something would happen to me - like getting my wallet stolen - and it would cause tourist police to come in and ruin their celebrations. Fair enough.



Now I became a marked man. Every local was smiling and shouting random things at me, as I was covered
Hanging With Randoms
During festivities by the river
in the colours of their festival. I found Louise chilling at the hotel. She laughed when she saw me, and also wanted to join in. We were in luck - all the celebrating would culminate in a procession that would be passing right next to our Hotel as they head down to the river to submerge effigies of the Goddess Durga into it. We stripped off all our valuables and jumped right in. The festivities were much like my dancing episode earlier, but way more intense. Everyone wanted to know where we were from, how we liked India, and wanted to point out all their family members at the festival, like it was of the utmost importance that we meet them all. I carried one guy's daughter along for a bit, shook a million hands, rubbed coloured powder on randoms (and visa versa!), sat down with a group of guys who all just wanted to ask questions (and all laughed whenever I called their friend a word they just taught me), took photos of people on request, and of course, danced with them. I was also Louise's boyfriend for the proceedings, just to play it safe for her. I got

We needed an ATM, and the one we were at was broken. This kind gentleman offered us a space on the back of his bike to the nearest working one, free of charge.
quite a few compliments for having such a hot girlfriend, while she was standing right next to me. It was mostly friendly and fun, but there was definitely a growing element of danger that I became conscious of as things progressed. Something was going on which I couldn't quite put my finger on. A few people warned us to be careful, as if something was afoot. A couple mentioned our skin colour as potentially problematic. At one point a serious dude came and shouted at all the people around us to leave us alone - I was told he was police, though he was in plain clothes. One guy invited us to lunch, quite demandingly, and it took a lot of talking to get out of it. It did get just a touch scary having such large groups surrounding me. Louise felt a quite intimidated at times too, which is when she caught my attention so the dutiful boyfriend could step in! Still, it was a unique experience, and I'm glad I went. The best part was that I could actually interact with the locals without feeling like it was leading up to another sales opportunity. We eventually decided enough
Watching the Taj After Sunset

was enough, and made it back to the hotel with everything intact. It was only 3pm too - what a day! After jumping in the shower with all my clothes on, I had another serious power nap. As much as I love it, being the center of attention is draining!



We ended our action packed day sitting on a rooftop restaurant overlooking the Taj, with the 2 Israeli girls again, and watched a beautiful sunset. We laughed as we saw pretty much every available space at the Taj being taken up with queuing tourists. Suckers.

September 14th 2013
Published: October 16th 2013


I am going back in time now to the start of our trip.

We landed in Dehli after several weeks of worrying about our visa and several applications, resulting in very little sleep and all my poor friends listening to my fretting!

After arriving at Dehli at midnight, we had an early train from Dehli to Tordi Gahr, a small village, at 5am on Sunday 15th. This was a strong awakening to the standard of living and amount of poverty that was waiting us for the next 10 days. There were homeless people and a slums lining most of the track, with most of the men taking an early morning dump in the middle of the field next to the tracks! You couldn't help but look!!

The train connected with a jeep for a 2 1/2hr bumpy ride with no views, and extreme heat! We arrived in Todri Gahr and was welcomed into an ancient palace, our accomodation for the night. Mark and I slept! Happy days!

The next day we had a tour of the village and met some locals and livestock. We were warned that the water buffallo were very dangerous, not because they attack us, but because they were scared of white skin! They stampeded to get away from us!! Then we visited they primary school and chatted with the kids there, they loved their picture to be taken! Then some of the girls played clapping games with me and won!

After the village we travelled to Jaipur, with vast silk shops and colour and spice filling every section it was amazing! We also caught a Bollywood movie here, no english but plenty of crowd whistling and shouting gave us an idea, great experience.

We travelled to Agra next, home of petty theives, harassement and the astounding Taj mahal! Breath taking is the only way to describe the feeling of seeing it for the first time. We watched the sun setting over the back of the mosque and headed out for a hearty curry tea.

Agra fort was the final installment of the love story behind the Taj Mahal, very interesting, but incredibly hot. From Agra we travelled up to Varanasi where we walked hurriedly between traffic coming from every direction to the Ganges to watch the sunset and ceremonies the accompany it. We lit tea lights and made wishes as we set them adrift on the river. The next morning at 5am again we watched the sunrise and saw the variety of buildings ranging along the riverside. We heard stories of the deads' burial pires and how children, pregnant women and sufferers of leprosy wouldn't be burnt, but just pushed into the water to be recieved by Shiva (i think)!

We all got ill from Varanasi! Dirtiest place i've ever been!

From Varanasi we travelled by bú for 15hrs to cross into Nepal, and into Lumbini, for a night in a jungle lodge. Mark seriously suffering at this point! No food for 24 hrs. This continued for 4days, Tekai gave him some antibiotics that made all the difference. 10days of a bad belly lasted into Tokyo tho!

Chitwan was our next stop, I loved Chitwan. It was so relaxed compared to India and the hustle and bustle that came with it. We had a canoe ride and an elephant safari. the elephants allowed us to get up close to a pair of mother and calf Rhino's, an awesome sight.

Our final few days were spent in Kathmandu. Kathmandu was full of history and culture and very little hard sell that wall all over our time in India. We spent a lovely day with Henry and Haydon showing us about Durbur square and walked upto monkey temple to get an incredbile view of the whole of this awesome city.

I loved india for its colour and life, but hated the constant fight to simply walk down the street, the amount of tipping required by our guide Vikash was half of everything we spent while there, making our time in India more expensive than our time in Japan!

I hope we can get back to Nepal, even though they have an incredible 11 security checks between entering the airport and getting on the flight, as it was an awe inspiring country with so much to offer...maybe even everest base camp one day!!

Blue sky taj
""Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passions of an emperor's love wrought in living stones.""
English Poet, Sir Edwin Arnold



Boarding yet another sleeper class train from Varanasi, our luck riding the rails seemed to have finally run out. As we made our way through the train towards our seats, we saw a family of ten (5 adults and 5 kids) and immediately crossed our fingers that this was not where we would be spending the next 12 hours. As I checked the ticket, I let out a small sigh of despair…..these were indeed our seats.

Don’t get me wrong, the family were actually fine and the kids very sweet, however when you board a train that is stiflingly hot and humid with no A/C and it’s around 26 degrees at night, the last thing you need is 14 people sitting in an area that should only fit 8. Having not totally gotten over our bouts of Delhi Belly, Donna and I were not at our most tolerant, and so the long ride towards Agra begun……

After a fairly loud and insect infested 12 hours, we awoke at dawn with
Sun hitting the Taj
the morning sun shining into our carriage, wondering if we had reached our stop. I went for a look out of the door of the still moving train, and saw the amazing structure of Agra fort. Yep, this was us. As I glanced back over the river towards the morning light, still rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I was met with quite an amazing and unexpected sight. There standing in the distant haze was the Taj Mahal. I never expected to be able to see it from the train, but there it was in all its glory. My first glimpse of the reason we headed to Agra, and even from this distance, I could already see why this was classed as one of the most beautiful buildings ever constructed.

We decided that as we had 2 nights here, we would refrain from seeing the Taj on the first day, and wait until the next morning, where we would go see it at Sun-rise. This left us to hang out in our surprisingly cheap but very nice hotel about 1km away from the Taj Mahal’s East Gate. So, despite still trying to fight the remainder of this bug we
Water reflection
had both caught and grabbing some dinner, we did fairly little on our first day here. I think the main event of the day was fighting off the hordes of rickshaw and Tuk Tuk drivers that followed us from the moment we exited our hotel. No different from anywhere else in India, except these guys were a touch more persistent and literally tagged along with us from the moment we left the hotel to the second we arrived at the restaurant we decided to eat in. We were hit with everything from ‘Maybe later?’ and ‘Why not, very cheap?’ to ‘Join me in my helicopter’ and ‘But everybody says no thank-you?’…… these phrases will haunt me for a long time after I leave India I fear.

As the alarm went off at 4:30am, Donna and I found it surprisingly easy to get out of bed and get ready for the day ahead. This can only be due to the fact that we were clearly looking forward to today as usually 4:30am starts involve a lot more moaning and a lot more snoozing.

Having walked the short distance to the East Gate in the dark, we were actually quite
Taj reflection
surprised at the lack of people queuing and were very close to the front of the queue. Come 5:45am as the sun had just started to rise, the doors swung open, and in we went filled with anticipation and excitement. As we approached the archway leading into the grounds of the Taj Mahal, the first glimpse you get literally takes your breath away. It’s hard to explain, but it almost doesn’t seem real or something? When you have seen an image of something so many times before in magazines and on TV etc, I find it’s sometimes hard to comprehend that you are actually looking at that very same thing in the flesh.

As we walked through the archway, it opens right up and there it was in all its beauty. To say it’s beautiful is really an understatement, and seeing it for the first time, you can easily see why this is classed as probably the greatest building in the world.

The next three hours or so were spent looking around and taking photos of this work of art. We were careful not to take too many pictures and sometimes just sat and admired it from a
Inlaid precious stones
bench or from the floor. Looking at the Taj Mahal from the ‘classic postcard view’ doesn’t get boring, however its only when you get close up, you realise how amazing this building is as a structure and not just aesthetically. With all the marble that makes up the majority of the building, the Sanskrit writing up the sides of the entrance and the stunning Pietra Dura (precious stone and marble inlay work), this is a fantastic building from up close and from further away.

Unfortunately, you are unable to take photos inside the Taj, so I’ll try to describe what’s actually in the building after you have marvelled at the outside. Entering through an enormous arched recess you are met with a much smaller interior than you may have anticipated. Directly in the middle is the fake tomb of Mumtaz Mahal behind an awesome screen, all carved from one piece of marble which is inlaid with filigree patterns and precious stones. Next to Mumtaz Mahal lays another fake tomb, being her husband and creator of the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan. His tomb is about the only thing that isn’t symmetrical throughout the Taj as its awkwardly positioned to the
Sanskrit1
right of Mumtaz, and is randomly significantly larger than his wife’s tomb that the Taj was actually built for….?

I think one of the most surprising things for us was that at no time did we feel the place was overcrowded nor did it ever get too much. There were of course many people there from the beginning, and this only grew as time went on, but apart from a couple of over-eager guides man-handling people this way and that to get them in to positions for pictures, we never felt that the vibe in there was anything but calm. There was one exception to this when a middle aged English guy told his wife that the guide was going to ‘Get a slap’ if he carried on with all this photo taking nonsense….fair play, as I reckon I would have felt the same way if I were being pulled from pillar to post like he was!

That evening, far from having had enough of the mighty Taj Mahal, we decided that a dinner overlooking this magnificent building was called for. We headed for The Taj Gange area and found the restaurant with the best view and sat
He stole my Coke!
down for some food. So, with the sun setting, and with the world’s most beautiful building in our view we sat back and basked in the moment. This was until a brazen monkey popped his head over the balcony we were sitting at and with all the confidence in the world, strolled across our table and stole my coke! Cheeky little git. My only relief was that it was a Coke and not a beer, as had my stomach fully recovered from the Delhi Belly, that would have been my drink of choice, and he may have found himself with more of a fight on his hands!

It’s not often you get to see something so special in your life, but in our time travelling, we have been lucky to see some amazing things. Now, I am happy to be able to add the Taj Mahal to our experiences. In regards to something living up to its hype, the Taj Mahal for us, is right up there, and we certainly didn’t leave disappointed.

Cows and trash...standard
So, the time had come to face Varanasi. I think out of everywhere we wanted to go to in India, this was the place we feared the most. This fear mainly came from speaking to people that had been previously, but also from our guide book that starts the Varanasi chapter off with the words ‘Brace yourselves’. To be honest, now that we had been in India for around two months or so, we were starting to know how everything worked over here, and the fact that we would have rickshaw drivers hassling us and shop sellers dragging us into places wasn’t really anything new to us, so we cut the pessimism and stopped the worry. The fact that this place would bring us burning corpses and people bathing in one of most polluted rivers in the world still however, left us with a slight unease as to what we were up against and to what sort of people we would encounter whilst here.

On the train from Gwalior there was little to talk about until we got very close to Varanasi, and that’s when everything changed. Suddenly the train stopped and off jumped a couple of guys from the
Large Buddha
carriage next to ours, holding what looked to be women’s bags. This was closely followed by several other men, running after them shouting no doubt all manner of obscenities in Hindi. Shortly after chasing these perpetrators, the common hero’s from the train dragged these rascals back to the train by the scuff of the neck until we reached the next station, where they were dragged along the platform and no doubt given a good wallop with the large sticks that the police carry with them. All this was happening whilst sipping our train bought Chai Tea (more on this later), and it was all very entertaining indeed. Who needs a TV?

Twenty minutes or so down the line, this same scenario happened all over again. Different ‘Perps’, same have a go hero’s and same outcome….. more scruff of the neck grabbing and plenty more dragging along the railway line and being slung back on the train. Having watched these brave acts, we nodded in appreciation of the ‘train hero’s’, grabbed our bags a little closer to us, and sat back as we made our way to the Holy City.

On arrival at the hotel, through the crazy streets
Sanarth
and bustling markets, we were fairly happy with our choice. It was near the Ghats (the steps leading to the Ganges river), fairly quiet and the room was half decent albeit a little dark. When checking in, the resident hotel tour operator sat us straight down and kindly showed us a few things on the map. We have been here long enough to know that this is code for ‘I’m gonna try sell you a tour before you step outside and get one cheaper’, however the guy was friendly enough and we wanted to see what was on offer. After being shown everything that was worth seeing and doing on the map, he quoted us what seemed a decent price, and so we accepted and quickly went about starting the tour that afternoon with a trip to Sarnath. We were a little tired from the thrills of the overnight train and the theft debacle, but decided that if we started now, it would give us more opportunity later to wander around Varanasi by ourselves over the coming days.

Sarnath is around 12km away from Varanasi and is said to be the place where Buddha held his first sermon. We
Crazy streets of Varanasi
had heard about this from our time in Sri Lanka, so it seemed like a cool place to go visit. After having been there, I can confirm that it was, and on top of a fairly new Buddhist temple (the old one was burned down) and an even newer 80ft Buddha statue, there was also a very old stupa which is said to contain some of Buddha’s ashes….all very impressive and a good hour or so well spent.

After this relaxing tour of Sarnath, we were quickly headed back towards Varanasi where we would be seeing the famous Ganga Aarti ceremony of Fire and Dance. In-between hitting our guide Manush with hundreds of questions regarding Varanasi, Buddhism, Hinduism and anything else we could think of, as well as having a bit of banter with him and his driver, we hurtled towards the ceremony at an unbelievable pace considering the amount of traffic on the roads. Narrowly missing the ‘traffic police’ (Cows in the middle of the road) as well as pot holes and humans, we eventually arrived at where we needed to be. It seemed where we needed to be was the middle of some kind of friendly riot.
Smoke at the Aarti
Thousands of people, animals, cars and rickshaws filled every nook and cranny of the one lane streets and it felt like we had arrived in the middle of a festival. Turns out, there was no festival, but just a regular day on the streets of Varanasi. This place certainly had some energy.

Unfortunately for us, as the monsoon had only recently died away here, the banks of the Ganges were at crazy high levels, and because of this, the ceremony was to be held on the roof of a building overlooking the Ganges rather than in its usual spot on a platform on the Ghats. Having got there early to grab a prime spot, we had decent seats, meant having to witness an hour and a half of people shuffling around and faffing whilst being shouted at by the ‘staff. Trying to organise a piss up in a brewery, these guys would fail in epic proportions! Considering this had been done every single day for the past 45 years, you would think they would have organisation licked by now…..no such luck.

Finally the ceremony started, and with half an hour of banging drums, incense being chucked around and
Flash flood
some large candles being ceremoniously branded about, truth be told, we were ready to leave. It was good to see, however it wasn’t the most thrilling thing we had ever watched. Saying that, this isn’t just done to keep tourists happy, and is a 45 year old ritual ceremony, so who are we to grumble, and so we just took it as part of our Varanasi experience. Maybe had it been performed in its usual spot on the platform by the Ghats, it may have intrigued us a little more, however saying that, probably not if we are honest.

Our second day was due to start with more sightseeing, followed by some downtime so we could explore Varanasi by ourselves, or go have a beer on a rooftop or what-not. Sadly for us, this plan came to a grinding halt around 9pm, the evening before, during dinner when Donna started to feel a little sick and made her way to the room. Not long after this whilst Donna started to try sleep off her on-going sickness, I also took a turn for the worst, and it wasn’t long before I would be running to the bathroom myself. It was
Sadhu's on the streets of varanasi
starting to look like a toilet rota system was going to have to be worked out with us both in a pretty bad way. Due to this sudden illness, we cancelled the 5am sun-rise boat trip we were due to attend with Manush and hoped a day in bed would see off this nasty bug.

Come the morning, neither of us were much better and with alternate stomach cramps we both suffered miserably in our room. Thinking where we could have caught this bug from, we immediately assumed it must have come from the Chai Tea that we were sipping whilst watching the drama unfold from the bag thieves aboard the train. Fortunately, the cups are tiny, so we didn’t consume too much of this seemingly toxic liquid, however it was enough to put us out of action for a good 24 hours, so we thanked our lucky stars we didn’t buy a mug of the stuff!

The next morning, we awoke feeling a little better and so decided to go ahead with the sun-rise boat ride on the Ganges. We were a little sceptical about this as at the time, all boats had been banned from the
Boats on the Ganga
river due to the high water levels, however Manush assured us he had a guy that would get us on the water no problem as long as we avoided the police….. Following the guys down the pitch black lanes and back alleys towards the Ghats at 4:30am, my stomach seemed even less keen than I did to get on the boat……

Once on the boat, all this negativity disappeared though, and the tranquillity and calm of being some of the only people on the river gave us a great feeling of peace. To add to this, we were then given a small container holding a candle and some flowers to release on the river and told to make a wish. So, lighting the candle and placing it on the water along with our wish, we watched our lights float down the Holy Ganges taking our hopes and dreams with it.

As the sun started to rise and with the dark receding, we were shown several of the 365 Ghats along the river. Each Ghat has a different purpose or meaning, and we saw all sorts of people bathing, practising Yoga, meditating and praying along the side of the
Varanasi Ghat
river. We were also taken to one of the Ghats where cremations take place, and was stunned, as we actively watched someone recently passed burning in front of our very eyes. This is not uncommon to see here mind, as this particular Ghat saw 30-40 cremations day in, day out. Watching this ceremony it’s difficult to describe how we both felt about the situation due to how bizarre it is, however here, it’s just part of everyday life and to be cremated on the banks of the Ganges is a very holy thing for Hindus across the world.

After our boat trip came a walk around the winding streets of Varanasi with our guide Manush. We usually don’t like to have guides with us all the time, however here it was just so interesting getting the low down on the ins and outs of life here in the Holy city. We were taken down all manner of side alleys and backstreets that we would definitely have missed out on had we gone alone, with everything being explained to us as we went. We saw another couple of burning ceremony’s whilst back at the Cremation Ghat we saw from the
They go through tonnes of wood for the daily cremations
boat earlier. This time we witnessed each stage of the burnings as we saw one body reduced to ashes, another that had just begun, and finally a corpse being carried through the streets towards the Ghat with the family praying as they walked. I think for me, this was the one that hit hardest and made it all very real.

Having Manush with us had other benefits other than just providing information, as being with him meant people left us alone. It certainly made our stroll a lot more hassle free than it perhaps would have been had we been on our own. It really was an interesting and informative couple of hours finding out who did what, when and why, including which Sadu’s were fake and which were real and how to tell them apart (official Sadu’s don’t like you taking their picture, fake ones loved it and charge you for the honour!) . All in all, a great little tour of the Ghats.

We finished off with a trip going to visit a couple of temples. One in town and the other inside the university grounds which was interesting to see. More so because of how
Varanasi
peaceful it is within the University walls in comparison to the hustle and bustle of Varanasi outside.

All in all, despite the bouts of Delhi Belly, we actually really enjoyed our time in Varanasi. Sure it’s crazy, loud and busy, but it doesn’t pretend to be anything else, it embraces this in fact. Seeing people washing and dunking their heads in a river that hosts dead cows, dead humans and more raw sewage than you can imagine is something I’m not sure either of us will ever understand, however that’s why we come to these places I think. To get another perspective, and to respect that there are other cultures and ways of life out there that, although we don’t always fully understand, it doesn’t mean that they are wrong or any less worthy than any other way of life.

Varanasi is a real eye opener, and a place like no other. What was once a place I was sceptical about is now one that I respect and marvel over.

Burning Ghat woodpile (one of)
Puts my cache in Australia to shame!
Our path is to heal. To create the circumstances where healing can begin.



A Course in Miracles





One of the more delightful things about India is the random event or meeting. Again the hindi word 'kudrat' (gift from god) comes to mind to describe these occasions.

I was minding my own business having a day of slow walking through the northern ghats along the Ganga. Of course, access is very limited now because the river is so high – you cannot walk along the ghats; you can only take separate little side streets to explore whether they lead to the waters edge (which is now lapping high at steps above the submerged infrastructure below).

Having had a swim at Lalita Ghat, and a nap in the cool tunnel (along with some babas who didn't seem to mind me sharing a part of the side concrete slab with them), I ventured on towards the Burning Ghat. But I was not that interested in seeing bodies burning (been there and done that a lot in previous visits when the water was low and you could move around a little, and in the heat
Approach to Uma's house
This is the view coming down the steps that captured me - tranquil and cool out of the midday sun
of the day in late summer, its no joy being close to fire and smoke). I ventured into a wood yard just for interest, and after dismissing the hawkers selling death views from balconies and other vantage points, continued north.

At the top end of Manikarnika Ghat, I stumbled across a picturesque and cool grotto at the waters edge. There above me to the left was a man on a gorgeous little balcony. I sat and gestured a greeting, also commenting on the beauty of the edifice on which he stood. In a soft voice that immediately inspired trust, he invited me into his house.

Voila! Kudrat! Inside was the most tranquil (hindi name is shanti) temple foyer leading into an inner sanctum surrounded by a marble floor hall and outside ornate stone verandah which now (due to the high Ganga) had absolute water views. A soft cooling breeze was floating in off the fast flowing water. The man invited me to sit and rest. He explained that this temple and house was the property of the Maharaja of Rajasthan (Varanasi, being the Mecca of Hinduism, has many buildings belonging to various maharajas from states and past kingdoms
Opposite Umas house
Just a quaint little side alley
across India). The man left me, assuring me I could sit and rest as long as I wished.

After a short time he came and sat with me. He was a Brahmin and his name was Uma. He was 56 years old, married, and had a 12 year old son. After some initial discussion about where I was from and what I did in my country he told me in his broken English that he had 'mind trouble' and could I help him? He used to have a shop in the market but for 10 years had not been able to face it. We discussed his condition and agreed that he was talking about chronic depression. He was interested in whether I knew of any medication and confirmed that he had been prescribed some but it just sent him to sleep all the time. We discussed the importance of exercise, a good social network of at least 2 or 3 friends who understood the condition, good diet, meditation, and allowing thoughts to come and go without them taking over ones state of being.

We seemed to get on well with ease. We talked about how happy we were
Uma on his balcony
Uma told me his name was that of the female side of Shiva (Parbati)
to have met each other. He then had to go to the market to have a ceiling fan motor repaired. The way he again let me be and felt comfortable to go and do that made me feel very accepted. While he was away I had a fantastic nap on the marble floor (ah – I had brought my 'borrowed' Qantas rug!!).

When he returned 40 minutes later, he asked if I would like chai – and off he went to have it prepared (presumably by his wife). We sat out on the balcony and drank the chai.

More than 2 hours later I decided it was time to head off. I asked if it was OK to visit again while at the same time he asked I would. I will.

Kudrat!

I woke up at 5am. I'd like to be able to sleep a little longer but I just don't. No pressure – always time for naps during the day. I meditate for about 40 minutes – its a good time to do it as the house and streets are quiet now. My Guest House is a family home and apart from Deepak and his wife Sanjana (heavily pregnant and looking like a blossoming lotus), various relatives and their children are staying.







The rooftop is lovely for doing hatha yoga – a sweet breeze is blowing in from the Ganga (which is visible and just a block away). I am joined by my three young chelas (students) aged 8, 6, and 3 who, amidst giggling and joking to themselves, try to copy my assanas.

be the best curd in town, and some dried fruits and muesli.







Now is a good time to catch up on emails before having a shower and doing my washing. One important reason why its a good time is that internet connections actually work pretty well before 10am after which office India goes on-line.







The morning is now getting on slowly (its 6.30) but the great thing is how long the morning is. Nothing serious is opening in the market until 10 or later, although there are chai shops if I fancied an early stroll and chai. But I stay in my room and waste an hour answering emails and working on blogs.







I have a plan (always good to have a plan). Its becoming a daily plan (albeit totally flexible at any time). Its important to have a plan – or a structure – to just pass the day with a semblance of some purpose. The plan is what it is – however slippery! I am running too late now to go and have chai with Laloo and
Satish
Sitting in his chai shop - a master of chai and a noble man
Norman (an 8am regualar happening at Laloo's). I lived at Laloo's place together with some Swiss friends for about a month in 1982. We were all getting into studying Indian classical music (some more seriously than others) when one of the Swiss friends had a bit of a breakdown and suicide attempt and I had to take him back to Switzerland. I never got back into that music path in Varanasi, but I did look Laloo up again when I returned here in 2009. Norman is from that era but I only really met him in 2010 – he is from the UK but lives a lot of the time in Varanasi and also rides an Royal Enfield (motorbike) around the country when he can.







I will walk through the market, and my plan begins to take form. Now which of my favourite chai shops will I patronise this morning? I have this mythological belief that its important to my chai shop 'friends' that I maintain patronage – what is that? Otherwise they won't like me? They'll go broke? Ha! The idea of 'friend' in India – all a bit slippery and constructed
Om Nama Shivaya Baba
I suspect this baba is quite wealthy - he is always dressed immaculately and it seems obvious he has a decent place to live. But he does like a free chai!
around my need to think I have 'friends' and that I am liked. But some of the people here I have known for years – and among them I think I could say that maybe 2 or 3 would do anything for me (well.... come on Paul.... anything?). Those few are people I don't do any business with, which keeps it real.







One such person (well he is a saint really) is 32 year old Nitin. Nitin is just a amazingly generous socially responsible young man who is always involved in a myriad of projects helping disadvantaged people in Varanasi. He runs a toilet-size shop selling this and that in his 'spare' time. His main other job right now is working as a health worker in a free clinic that a local doctor has set up which operates 6 days a week from about 9am till 12. I pass the clinic on my way to the market and buy Nitin and his 2 co-workers a chai. The clinic has about 6 patients lined up for attention to minor wounds (all of which can become toxic if not treated in this environment).

Kahinya housboat at Ranamahal Ghat
Looking out from the only approach now. Amazing to think that last time I walked amidst the temples and steps that are now submerged at least 10 metres below. The houseboat is a constant party for the idle boat wallahs - playing cards, cooking, smoking, drinking. Another exclusive men's club in India!






Its just after 9 now. On the way through there is a sweet shop run by Vishnu who I met in 2010. I buy four of my favourite sweetmeats to have in my bag ready to give some unsuspecting 'friend' as a random act of kindness (such generosity!!).







I choose to have a chai at Balu's. I would call him an 'aquaintance', but most of all he makes bloody good chai. And watching him throw the used tea leaves across the street and ALWAYS have them land in the same tight corner of the drain is a sight to appreciate – skill born of daily practice.







At Manoge's fruit stand, I present Manoge with my sweets. I choose a small papaya and ask him to save it for me for when I return on my way back to my room.







Ah, my plan which has become a common plan – is to make it to Lalita Ghat by about 10.30 to meet Gopal, a 59 year old milk wallah who spends a couple of
Kahinya
hours there every day taking a Ganga (Ganges River) bath, meditating, doing some hatha yoga, and performing his puja (prayers and offerings). The Ghat is very peaceful with small temples inhabited by a priest and his chela. About 10 meters underwater now, due to the swollen flooding Ganga, is the most gorgeous little temple that can only be seen from a boat during the winter months when the Ganga has receded.







After some vigorous swimming against the very strong current, I sit plus do some assanas with Gopal under the shade of a tree overhanging the ghat.







On the way back to the main market, I visit Satish in his chai shop in the middle of the fruit and vegetable market which is right on the route taken by the funeral marches to the burning ghat. 'Nama Ram Sacta He' is the chant as another body is carried through ('there is no other name than that of Rama'😉. Satish is a chai yogi – to watch him as he prepares the best chai I know is to watch pure form and mindfulness in motion. He serves
Rama Guru
Ahilya Bai Ghat. Nov 2011. First met him Dec 1980. Died Mar 2013. His chai was not always great but what a location!
his chai in clean small white porcelain cups (nice touch!).







The question now is where to have lunch. I am careful about a regular and well balanced diet but I tend to only have one main full meal in a day – breakfast as described and otherwise a smaller snack – but lunch or very late lunch is usually an Indian tali or similar. There is a great Nepalese restaurant which does a scrumptious tali for 40 rupees (and although I don't have the appetite to pig out, its one of those talis where if you want extra dahl or sabje or rice, you just ask for it). So its what I do again today. A bit slippery eating alone – and if I were hit with an option to eat with someone I'd take it up if I could muster the confidence to ask them, but no such opportunity has arisen after a week here.







I walk back through the market and greet Mahindra at his small music store. He invites me in and I get to play one of his better guitars that are
Rana mahal and Ahilya Bai ghats
So at the left is where Kaniya's house boat is parked - the small white dome at centre left border of the pic is completely submergerd. The steps at the left of the picture (also submerged) is where Rama Guru ran his chai shop for at least the last 33 years (when I first met him).
on sale. I travel with my electronic tuner, capo, and a pick for just such occasions. There are a regular couple of young Japanese girls getting tabla and djembe lessons from Mahindra. So we play together for a bit and have a lemon chai.







On the way back to my room it starts to rain – heavily – but its just a 10 minute shower. Its lovely as it cools everything down. I am talking to myself as I walk (hm.... I have noticed I do a lot of talking to myself these days – a bit slippery that!). And the streets themselves are very slippery with cowshit mixed with fresh rain. My score after a week in Varanasi is two slips (but no falls) and three treading in cowpats. All part of being in this wonderful but very dirty city. However, it is believed that cowshit is quite sterile – and of course it is used all over India to make cowpats that are sundried for cooking fuel.







Sometimes things happen and afterwards you are left thinking “did I dream that or what?”. Carolina and

My room is the door in the middle of the pic!
I had befriended a baba on the ghats in November 2011. This man was either insane or enlightened with a pure mind. He would sit for hours each morning simply clapping his hands, big smile on his face, chanting “Om nama Shivaya” (great is the name of Shiva – praise him). Making my way back to my room after lunch, I chanced upon this baba. We chatted in broken hindi for a minute and I gave him 10 rupees for a couple of cups of chai. He had just passed a French guy who seemed to be engaged with a not too impoverished looking bunch of small kids. This guy sees me give the money to the baba and starts to give me a strong lecture about how I should be only giving money to the children – the greatest and real need (having misinterpreted my gesture to an old 'friend' as misdirected charity). I tried to explain that the baba was someone I knew and had not seen for 18 months – but the Frenchman was having none of it. So I pointed to his amazingly huge and expensive Canon camera and said “go and sell this and then
outside Kedar Ghat temple
YOU give that money to these kids OK?”. I don't think he got it. Slippery guy!







But what is more interesting is my own reactions to these sorts of confrontations around the giving of money to people in India. Obviously I, like everyone, am unresolved about my amazing wealth amongst the constant 'in your face' relative poverty. I have often said to people in the West that what India teaches you (among many things) is that you are kidding yourself if you believe you are a generous person – so get over it. You happen to be born into privilege being a Westerner, making you extremely rich and free in India. If you gave everything away (and then qualified as a totally generous person) you would only add yourself to the poor of India. If you don't, then you need to realise your position in this world, accept it, and let it go. Nonetheless it is a great pastime deciding how to give some of your money away. Anyway, its all a bit slippery!







I run into Saisi who is a clothes shop owner in the
Main Ghat
market. We have had many good conversations about life the universe and everything – I like his sense of existential acceptance of the light and dark. I have not done business with him, just been a 'friend'. On this occasion he is talking to a Swiss couple and he invites them to dinner at his house that night. As I leave, I observe my reaction to never having been so invited to dinner by Saisi. I am a little indignant and disappointed. Perhaps its just because I am not doing business with him? Paranoia? Or another reality about the slipperiness of 'friendship' in India? Whatever. I let it pass.







I get back to my room, take a shower and nap – needed and great – for about 20 minutes before setting out again.







Kahinya is a quite well known boatman in Varanasi – known for his strength mostly. He won several boat races they have between the two bridges of the city. He is a simple man, and quite alert to 'friendships' with a select few amidst the pretty impersonal high end of the tourist trade
Ghats Nov 2011
See brown building middle left - water now covers the lower third of that building!
whereby he makes his money. He owns several rowboats, one motor boat and manages one houseboat. Despite his simplicity, never having much cash at hand, smoking way too much ganga, and now also into whiskey, you'd have to say he was asset rich.







I have his address still from a time I had been in Varanasi and invited on a picnic by boat across the river with a dozen Varanasi 'gentlemen', and I later sent him some photographs by mail. With the river so high, its impossible to walk the ghats (where I would usually just find him). So I spend about an hour trying to decipher the amazingly illogical street numbering system of old Varanasi.







Eventually I find his friend who leads me to Ranamahal Ghat where the houseboat is moored as a kind of all day (and night?) floating men's club for monsoonal unemployed boat wallahs. Its a joyous reunification and I am quickly feeling at home as I ditch my pants and shirt and apply my gumpcha as a lungi and sit comfortably in the Ganga breeze. I am invited to stay for freshly netted fish which have drifted down from the mountains. They are cooked to perfection on the boat together with thick chapatis and rice. Perhaps the least slippery event of the day? I'll see how it pans out over the next week. I am invited to spend the night but can't quite picture it so I decide to go back to the Guest House.







It is then too that I learn from Kahinya that Rama Guru died about 5 months ago. Rama was a chai wallah parked on the steps next to the Ganga at Ahilya Bai Ghat back when I first came to this city in December 1980 and used to spend a lot of time at the ghats swimming and washing and taking it all in. When I returned to Varanasi after a 28 year absence, Rama Guru was still parked in that very spot serving chai! Will he be missed? I don't know if it works like that in India. His daughter will take over the business once the water recedes.







On the way back, I buy a small sweet lassi and 100 grams of dahi (curd) from Shyam's shop at Assi Ghat.Then one last lemon tea at Kashi Cafe before heading to bed (which I do by around 10 pm).







Only small problem is that there is a wedding the next day next to my Guest House – friends of Deepak and Rajana – so they are availing the area right outside my room to the preparation of sweetmeats for the event – a rather noising undertaking which keeps me awake until 12.30. What to do?







I am still standing (well before I went to bed that is) and thinking about my place in the world, despite all the slipperiness!



There will be time, there will be time

Indian Women Entering Taj Mahal Complex at Dawn
We’d only been in India for a few days before we got to see the Taj Mahal. Our hotel (Hotel Kamal, recommended) was about a 5-10 minute walk away, and we could actually see it from our hotel roof. We woke up early in the morning to try to see it before it was really packed with tourists. Warning: you go through metal detectors and they don’t allow food or drinks other than water inside. Also the line to enter (divided into gender and nationality (Indian and non-Indian)) took at least 15 minutes. We had been anticipating a lot of touts inside the Taj Mahal, but actually it was peaceful. Once inside, it was quiet and not too crowded. It’s beautiful in pictures, and it’s just as beautiful in person. I was actually more impressed with some of Agra’s other sites, just because they were also so artfully constructed, but I hadn’t known about them beforehand.

My two favorite Agra sites were Agra Fort and the “Baby Taj” (Itimad-ud-Daulah). Agra Fort was constructed mostly of red sandstone, and was built before the Taj Mahal was. It’s a big complex which encloses various palaces. We did borrow an audio-tour device, but
First Sight of the Taj Mahal
you can probably get away without it. The day we went, the fort was full of both Indian and non-Indian tourists. The Indian tourists were enamored of my sister, and frequently asked for our pictures. However, the allure of being a VIP didn’t last long. By the end of our visit to Agra Fort, we’d had it with our fans. Overall, though, I thought Agra Fort was great, especially because of the skillful inlays in the tiles. Don’t miss it if you go to Agra!

The Baby Taj is a tomb that we hadn’t heard or read about before we arrived in Agra. It was built after Agra Fort and before the Taj Mahal, so it includes both red sandstone and white marble in its architecture. It was possibly my favorite landmark of our entire trip, just because it was so unexpectedly beautiful and pleasant inside. There weren’t any touts inside, and we sat for a few hours, just writing in our journals and relaxing. The one thing that interrupted our solitude were some children perched above the exterior wall of the complex, who started yelling “A-lo!” (“Hello!”) at us. When we didn’t turn around and acknowledge them, some
Token Taj Mahal Picture
stones came flying past us. If one had hit us, we would have been furious, but they were probably just 7-year-olds who had nothing better to do than bother the white girls.

Those sites were great, but we also went to some others that, frankly, weren’t worth seeing, and also felt a bit unsafe due to their locations. These, which I wouldn’t recommend, were Chini-Ka-Roza and Methab-Bagh. We also went to a bit of a ritzy restaurant on the recommendation of a friend. It was called Dasaprakash, and after 3 days in India, we were ready to treat ourselves. It actually felt like we’d been there for weeks, just because of jet lag and the amount we’d learned and done in the previous few days. It specialized in Southern Indian food, and they also (bonus!) had ice-cream. So order a thali to split and save room for dessert!

While in Agra, we also got a cheap cell phone. You do need 1-2 copies of your passport, an address (a hotel address is fine), and some money (less than $40 for the cheapest phone and sim card). It’s definitely worth it. Also it takes a few days to activate,
Back Corner of Taj Mahal Complex
so try to get one when you first get to India. You can ask at your hotel for a recommended cell phone dealer.

We had another of my favorite experiences in India while eating breakfast on the hotel roof in view of the Taj Mahal. Roofs in India tend to be flat and used for hanging out laundry, making food, hanging out, etc. One of the neighbors of the hotel happened to be on his roof with his daughter, and they seemed to be playing a throwing game. But they didn’t try very hard to catch the things they threw up, which was weird. Soon, a group of hawks started circling, and that’s when we realized they were throwing the food up for the birds to catch in mid-air. It was so cool! They had some very unique pets! Also, while that was going on, the monkeys were hopping roof-to-roof and having monkey territory drama. There is always something to see in India.

We’d come into Agra on a train, and left Agra on a train. This train was to be our first overnight one, in the AC-3 compartment, headed for Varanasi. We had initially been worried about
Inlays at the Taj Mahal
the train travel, but Indian trains are pretty great. AC-3 means you have a bed to yourself, and there are even curtains to block off your bed. We did always lock our backpacks up to metal bars with bike locks on trains, but the people traveling on trains were generally helpful and kind. On this trip, we ended up with about 6 hours of sleep and arrived in Varanasi around 10 am.

Varanasi was a really cool and unique place. It’s along the Ganges River, and it’s known as the best place to die and be cremated in India, because of good energy there. When we were there, it was full of people because it’s a place for both Hindu pilgrims and hippy-ish Western tourists as well. There are a lot of beggars there who seem to make do alright because pilgrims are likely to give alms. There are “babas”, holy men with a minimum of clothes, generally covered in a kind of mud or ash, who live lives of asceticism. There were cows. And dogs. Jodi saw a baba carrying a cobra. But, it wasn’t as dirty or crazy as we expected. It was colorful and a bit
Taj Mahal at Dawn
chaotic. Overall, it was winding alleyways, which sometimes ended up at riverside ghats, and some interesting architecture that looked like a wedding cake about to fall over.

There weren’t so many tourist “sites” to see in Varanasi—it’s more the kind of place to sit and people-watch or think. We did take a dawn boat ride up the river, which was nice, but the pre-boat-ride bargaining over the price did slightly diminish the charm. In addition, knowing that the man expending a lot of energy rowing our boat probably got less of a cut than the man who was able to speak English to lure tourists was upsetting. Still, it was cool to see the city and ghats from that perspective. I should also mention that Jodi and I ate a good meal at the Dolphin House Restaurant (admittedly up about 7 flights of stairs from the ghat below), but the Aloo Dum Benarasi and Harilyali Kofta were delish. By this time we had looked up and learned the most pertinent menu offerings for the area (fyi—paneer/naan=bread; dal=a lentil stew; kofta=meatball or ball of vegetables; korma=a kind of stew or curry; masala=a mixture of spices; aloo=potatoes; pullau=pilaf (rice); makhani=”with butter”).
Outside Agra Fort


While in Varanasi, we took a day trip to Sarnath, which is actually where Buddha preached his first sermon. Something I was really excited about before coming to India was how it’s influenced by/influenced so many religions. Although Buddhism is no longer popular in India, it remains the place where it started and grew. Anyway, because I had just lived in South Korea, I was interested in Sarnath. We asked a tuk-tuk driver to take us there, wait for us, and then drive us back, which is what was recommended, but I would have liked to spend 3-4 hours or overnight there, especially because it was more of a small, quiet town. It was a nice break from busy Varanasi.

After a few days in Varanasi, we were ready to move on—this time to a little town called Khajuraho. More about that in the next blog!

Bullet Man
“One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious”



Carl Jung



Waking up to a blue sky in the midst of the monsoon season said only one thing to me: “Its time to hop on that bike and go, Paul”. I had just spent 16 days in Bhubaneswar, the place I had lived and worked for 14 months in 2010/ 2011. Most of this time was spent in the laborious task of getting Gladys the wonder bike back in tip top shape. That had pretty much been achieved now, at vast expense.

As I do (I am just like that!), I packed to a pre-thought plan that had been forming over many months and weeks. Even as I thought about what it all back in Australia, in the back of my head were images of how I would pack Gladys on this new journey. I smiled as it all came to pass – everything in its place, everything fitting just so. As Carolina would say, everything has to be just “tick tack” with me (something she both admired as well as it driving her nuts!). Its this
Breakfast stop by the Martian
spectrum thing, what can I say?

I had also dreaded the thought, and worried as I do, about the prospect of this first leg of the journey 'riding out into the monsoon', into the unknown (well not completely, I had ridden this path in reverse just 20 months ago, albeit I wanted to try for a route with better roads this time). But the thought of riding in drenching rain, and then coming across (as you invariably do) pot-holed muddy quagmires of things that are dared to be called roads, was setting up a real challenge and even fear in my mind.

So setting out in sunshine was pure blessing! And it persisted. In fact to jump ahead a bit, I did not get rained on for the entire 1,000 kms to Varanasi. I saw plenty of dark clouds in the distance, and somehow seemed to skirt around patches of rain, and even rode on roads that minutes before had been drenched. Am I blessed or what? Note to self: Don't go too far with this blessed stuff Paul, it will bite you back sure!

Info for riders: The road from Bhubaneswar to Balasore (about 100 kms
My new friend Gopal at Lalita Ghat
more or less) was great – four lane national highway without much of a glitch. I pulled into a side village after an hour for a light breakfast and felt like a Martian descending in his space ship from the reaction of the locals. Highway 33 to Ranchi was half OK and half absolute shit! Potholes every second metre and dust and trucks (and it was the heat of the day – but hey, no rain!) - so that was hard going. Continuing the next day from Ranchi, the road to the Great Trunk Road (still highway 33) was pretty good and nice (some great winding four lanes through hills to boot. And then the Great Trunk Road to Varanasi was just easy (being national highway 1 and the pride and joy of Indian roads). If I had had cruise control on Gladys for this bit, I could have gone to sleep. Come to think of it, I nearly did go to sleep. So I stopped at one of those concrete bus shelters and had one of my power naps on the concrete bench.

There is a Hindi word “kudrat” (sp?) which means 'given from god' or something similar.
The swollen Ganga
I learnt it in 1982 in Pushkar, Rajasthan. I had been living in that place for about 3 months and there were rampant (and probably rabid) packs of dogs that prowled the streets at night. You had to have a stick and threaten to use it, or they would attack you. But Pushkar is a lake oasis in the desert and sticks are very hard to come by. Swimming in the lake one day (as you did back then) I chanced upon a floating stick. I grabbed it, polished it, carved an OM on it – and it still hangs in my Australian home as a hanger for a Buddha batik. I do digress, but the locals told me that finding this stick was pure “kudrat”.

So I am riding into Barapida (about half way between Balasore and Ranchi on day one) and all of a sudden my speedo fails. Shit! I really need that to judge distances and fuel use etc. And I think 'just my luck, and where am I going to find a bloody place to get this fixed?' About 100 meters up the road I hit a round about to take me out of town and voila – there on the corner is the Barapida Royal Enfield dealer – one of the new modern flash places that have sprung up all over India as part of the Enfield renaissance that is happening in this country. Pure kudrat! In about 40 minutes I have my speedo cable and wheel reader replaced for a grand total of 420 rupees (A$8). All while I sit inside a modern air conditioned show room eyeing off the new bikes on display.

Thoughts and more thoughts – riding alone is a mind trip. Many things, many memories, many monkeys playing in my mind. And now and again I reach back to touch a knee that is not there behind me. Emptiness and illusion. The void. It is what it is.

Each time I shout “you fucking idiot” to some crazy driver who has performed a death defying overtake or come at me by driving up the wrong side of the road (as they do – and this is a bit terrifying when its a large truck and you have just pulled into that lane to pass another truck!!!), I check myself: “Now Paul, lets settle that down and let's not get angry – lets see if you can stop these reactions and just remain calm”. But each time I react again – its like this pent up 'thing' that emerges from within, an uncontrolled outpouring of anger and disdain. It is what it is. Observe, accept it and let it go.

Riding into Ranchi (and its gotten dark now) I wonder about where I am going to find a decent place to stay. Almost as soon as I hit the middle of town, there is the 'Midtown Hotel' staring at me. I pull into this neat little bike parking area out the front, the guy in the front shop assures me I am at the right place (its almost as if he were expecting me) and ushers me down the lane to the Reception. There I find a delightful young Sikh with his father in the background, who is obviously delighted to have this foreigner here. I am shown a very passable non A/C (my choice – give me a fan anyday over air conditioning) attached bathroom suite for 540 rupees. I unpack, have a fantastic shower to clean off the grime and tiredness, wander downstairs and order a fabulous Jeera Rice and Molai Kofta, chat with the staff (I am after all the only customer at this time of the evening), arrange with said young Sikh to gain free access to a large A/C deluxe room in the morning so that I can do my hatha yoga, and then retire for a pretty good night's sleep. All is well – I feel in control of my stuff!

Next morning: Its India Independence Day – I pack and set off for Varanasi. First I buy an Indian flag and attach it at the back of Gladys. Just about every vehicle has one or two, and here is yet another small business annual windfall for those across the country who have been making these flags for weeks leading up to August 15 so as to sell them to proud Indians at 10 rupees each.

50 kms up the road, its puri and sabje (fried breads with vegetable curry) for breakfast rounded off with some sweet dahi (curd) and a chai. 24 rupees.

On the Great Trunk Road, there are ghosts that haunt my thoughts as I think how this was the very route taken by the revenging English army after what they called 'The Mutiny” in 1853 and what Indians called their uprising for independence. On their long march to Delhi (which they proceeded to level after massacring and driving out the entire population), they indiscriminately shot and hung people they came across along the route, without question or due process of law.

As I approach Varanasi I can feel the excitement mount – I start to think of the friends I am going to re-meet, of the delights of the place I am going to re-experience, and of the newness of coming back here for the first time during monsoon (the expectation about the swollen Ganga). When I finally hit the bridge across the Ganga, my heart soars and I shout out to myself. I see how huge mother Ganga is – and all the fields on her banks are flooded. I can't take the usual side track into the old city as its all flooded. I find a goat track which the locals assure me will take me straight to Assi (where I have booked a Guest House the night before on the smart phone – amazing modern technology). But when I wind through the approach to the place, the lane is flooded with putrid smelling water and I retreat. I remember a place I had checked out 20 months before as a potential for parking Glady safely in the yard – only I can't remember the name and only vaguely remember where it is. But I do OK – I am bit like the kid in that book 'The case of the dog in the night' (or similar?) and do this internal mapping strategy and find the place. Its great – large room, clean (!), and high and dry with Gladys safe inside the gate. 300 rupees a night (I didn't haggle – could have been less being the off-season).

I feel like I have arrived home. I am not tired – despite just having ridden almost 1,000 kms in two days (no mean feat on Indian roads – although my record is 1,400 kms in just two days – Bhubaneswar to Mahabalipuram – but I had a big motivation on that occasion!). I wash and head off towards the main ghat (but the ghats are all flooded – its amazing). I walk the back lanes and meet at least half a dozen 'friends' and am invited for as many chais and chats. Its lovely. I love this place.

There is an emptiness none-the-less. Last times here I was not alone. Memories flood. Another kind of flood.

The next day I do my ritual 'thing' with a swim in the Ganga – I find this lovely little shanti place called Lalita Ghat – just me and a newfound friend Gopal (whose age I happen to correctly guess as 59 which chufs him no end). We chat about our children and lives and do some power swimming on a short course between the shore and a light pole (which is, as with everything else, submerged by about 10 metres). The current is strong – very strong – and comes in surges – all the way from the Himalaya. Pure Shakti. It feels great! Even the sun is out (rare at this time of year). Blissful Mother Ganga!

Varanasi
Read any travel book, or talk to people who have been, and they will tell you: Rule #1 when traveling to New Delhi: “Watch out for scams”. We were both well aware of this; however, upon our arrival in New Delhi, within mere minutes of stepping out of the train station, we were taken for a doozy. We left the train station in search of the ‘Grand Bazaar”, which we knew was only a five minute walk, and we came across a man who claimed he worked for the rail station. He kindly informed us that the Grand Bazaar had been closed off due to religious conflicts (Hindu-Muslim) that had taken place during the Ramadan festival. He told us that in order to get into the area we had to go to the Government tourist office and get a pass (which is free) that confirmed we were staying at a hotel along the Bazaar. It was 8:30pm, we were tired, confused, and lost; this all sounded reasonably legit, so we decided to listen and the man had a tuk-tuk drive us to the Government office. Sure enough we arrived at an office with an official looking “Government of India: Tourism” sign.
Bath in the Ganges, Varanasi
Official looking men with uniforms and id tags greeted us and took us in to the office. They called our hotel to figure out how this situation could be solved. I was put on the phone with the ‘hotel owner’ and he told me that the hotel was closed for the night because on the conflicts occurring on the Grand Bazaar. I was furious, as we were now stranded at night, in the rape capital of India, with nowhere to stay. The tourist official took the phone from me and berated the man, telling him this was an unacceptable way to treat tourists! He said he would be reporting the hotel to the Government! The official offered his sympathies to us, and said he would help us find another hotel. He called a number of guesthouses that were within our budget and told us they were all full. He said the ONLY hotel available in New Delhi was just outside of town and was 5,000 rupees a night (our original hotel was 800 rupees). It was 9pm now and we just wanted to be inside a safe place; believing the tourist official was an honest Government employee, we gladly accepted
Dashashwamedh Ghat, Varanasi
the room. We talked about how lucky we were that railway employee had informed us about the Grand Bizarre closure, and how great the tourist employee was to take us in and help find a safe place to stay!

The next day when we arrived in Varanasi I received an email from our original hotel owner asking us why we never showed up, and why we had not called!? He said he was going to charge us a night rent at his hotel. I explained what happened, that the road was closed, that we had called from the tourist office and had been turned away from his hotel! In his email he responded, “You have been scammed!” He told us that the Grand Bazaar was NOT closed, that we had NOT spoken to the hotel owner (but instead the scammer’s associate), and that in fact there was no such thing as a Government tourist office in New Delhi. He said, “Everyone that you spoke to last night was involved in an elaborate scam, and I am sorry” We were gutted. I was furious at the scammers, and I was embarrassed that we had not seen

it. “Welcome to India!” we thought. Luckily the owner of our original hotel was very kind and did not charge us for the night we missed which helped stopped the bleeding a little bit. No more laid back Nepal! We learned from the experience, and read up on common Indian scams. We were on our toes now and ready for India.



Before we traveled to India we knew it would chaotic and intense. We knew the traffic would be crazy, there would be poverty, it would smell bad, all of that; our hour taxi drive from the Varanasi airport into the central town hit us with all of it, big time. Traffic is the first shocker you notice in India. Roads are completely packed with vehicles of all shapes and sizes, along with pedestrians, dogs, goats, and cows, all winding chaotically amongst each other as fast as can possibly be achieved. Horns are used constantly by all vehicles, not out of anger, just sort of to announce your presence, every second of your presence. There are no traffic lights, stop signs, crosswalks, nothing. Everyone just sort of honks and winds amongst each other in all directions; it
Hair Cut on the Ganges
is an incredible thing to experience first hand. We both love the experience of taking tuk-tuks and rickshaws in India; it is always an exhilarating, head shaking adventure. Being a pedestrian, on the other hand, is taking a leap of faith. You walk along the roadside, motorcycles and scooters whip past you on both sides, you squeeze past cows, horns blare non-stop, and you just have to simply trust that you won’t be hit. And usually you don’t!



The second thing you notice right away is the poverty, particularly the large amounts of garbage that can be found everywhere. Roadsides, rivers, parks, are all rittled with garbage. Large groups of cows gather in piles of trash along the roadside grazing for scraps. Varanasi is in Uttar Pradesh, one of the poorest states in India, and we are told that the garbage problem is particularly terrible in this state. You try to look beyond the trash, as you could easily let it ruin your experience, but in Varanasi it was so bad that walking down the narrow streets of old town was nearly impossible due to the amounts of garbage. In Varanasi there are also cows everywhere, and
Ghat Massage
I don’t mean like 10 cows, I mean there are many cows on every street, sidewalk, corridor, and ghat. There are also countless stray dogs, pigs, and goats all over the place. With this mass of animals running around comes the inevitable large amount of poo. Sounds lovely doesn’t it!? I won’t dwell on the garbage and poo, but it had to be mentioned, as it is a big issue in India, particularly in Varanasi.



Varanasi is said to be the oldest living city in the world. It is a maze of narrow streets that open up to a number of Ghats whose steps lead in to the Ganges River. Varanasi is also the holiest city in India, and Hindus from all over the country pilgrimage to Varanasi to bath in its water, dissolving themselves from a lifetime of sin. They also bring deceased family members to be cremated on the burning Ghats, and after their ashes spread into the Ganges. We visited two of the burning Ghats, and witnessed bodies being burned on open flames with families standing witness. It was quite a powerful thing to witness. At the other Ghats you see Brahmin, Holy
Silk man, Varanasi
Men, and other Hindu followers bathing in the waters of the Ganges or worshipping on the steps. The Ghats are a lively and intense place, with things going on twenty-four hours a day.



While visiting one of the main Ghats, a local old man approached me asking if I wanted a haircut. I did want my haircut! So after coming to an agreement of $1.50 (Canadian) he proceeded to chop off my hair, right there on the steps of the main Ghat. People couldn’t believe what was taking place, and out came the cameras. People were pointing, watching curiously, and taking pictures throughout the whole cut. It turned out to be the best haircut I’ve had in a long time! After the hair cut, my barber called his friend over, and the two of them proceeded to lay me down on a wooden platform where they gave me a full body massage for over 30 minutes. Every inch of me, almost literally, was vigorously attended to. It culminated with one man sitting behind me, his legs wrapped around my thighs, and his arms with me in a full Nelson. The other man had one hand across my back, and his other hand tugged my arm wildly into the air. I eventually had to make up an excuse and say we had dinner plans in order to end the public spectacle and get out of there. It was quite the scene, and each of them earned an additional 2 Canadian dollars when it was all said and done.



We also had young Varanasi guys often approach us asking us all sorts of questions about Canada, and about our travels. They would walk around with us and show us interesting things about Varanasi. As we walked I would mention to them that we had no money because we left it all at the hotel, and almost immediately they would lose interest in us. When I told one of the guys who was touring us around that we had no money, he was insulted that I even brought up money! He said he was a student, home on vacation, and just wanted to be friends and show us the city. We apologized and said that we would of course love for him to show us around, and that is was so nice to meet someone not trying to sell us things or scam us! He laughed and slowly toured us through the winding streets. Eventually we ended up outside an apartment where he said his uncle worked. He asked if we wanted to check it out and say hi, so we went in to take a look. Sure enough there was his uncle and a couple business associates waiting for us with big smiles and samples of silk scarves, quilts, and saris. They sat us down and showed us sample after sample for 15 minutes. “Ooooh” we thought, “there’s the scam….good one!” We listened politely for a while, then said we were not interested and left our friend behind.



You can only handle so much Varanasi before you need to escape to a quiet place. Luckily we had an amazing guesthouse that was located 10 minutes outside the old city in a quiet area. It was right on the Ganges River, and had an amazing rooftop terrace where you could get food and chill out. Our room was big and clean with air conditioning! It was a fantastic, much-needed oasis after hot days sightseeing. Varanasi was like being thrown in to the deep end of the pool, we had to start swimming pretty quick! The crowds, chaos, and poverty and are all full-on in Varanasi, and I think will be unmatched during the rest of our trip. I am glad we came to Varanasi. It is a different world, and a place that needs to be seen when in India, but I am happy to be moving on. We now have a 13-hour overnight train to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal! We are very excited to see what else India has in store for us.

Ready to head out for the day
On Saturday, I woke up very early. I decided to get some of my clothes laundered, so I didn’t need to unpack anything further for Sunday. After getting ready, I made my way to the lobby to meet the driver for my tour. It turned out that because I was hungry and would not be there when breakfast opened up, the front desk manager decided to have the head chef make me a special breakfast anyway. He also had them get together some snacks for my day trip. And all the additional services combined did not cost more than $20 USD

A driver came to bring me to another hotel where I would meet up with the other people from other hotels who would join the group. It ended up that the rest of the group were two other women – one from Canada and one from France. We had a driver. They had some bottled water for us and we were off! According to people, it would take a while because the roads were so bad, but as soon as we got out of Delhi, we got on the expressway and it just seemed like a normal highway to

me. Nothing bad at all. There were a few tolls to go through, yes, but nothing that was ‘bad’. Plus we were one of the only cars on the road.

Well, when we finally got near Agra, I could finally understand why people complained about the roads. To say they were bad would be a bit of an understatement. Agra and the outskirts were very poverty stricken. Luckily we were in a locked vehicle, but people could still see in the windows and would just stare at us. The roads were very congested. In order to get to Taj, we had to cross the river on a bridge, which was full of cars. At one point one of the tuk tuks (little cabs) clipped the back of our van. The case for the light came loose and started to hang. So, we were in the middle of the bridge, just got clipped by a little cab and our driver stops the car and gets out. All of the traffic began to swarm around the vehicle. Luckily it was a quick fix, but it was still a little bit of a freaky moment.

As soon as we crossed the

river, the driver pulled over to the side of the road and some guy jumped into the van. Luckily, he introduced himself quickly as our tour guide, Gurput. At one point, the road had been completed demolished in order to make way for a trolley line or something to that effect, and we has a little adventure driving over the raw terrain. These =drivers in India are incredible! Clutch, brake, accelerate, clutch again, e-brake…

When we got to the place where we were to go to Taj, we had to get our tickets. One of the ladies had to use the restroom – which they charged her for, if she wanted toilet paper, that was another charge…it goes to show you there is no such things as a free lunch, right?

After purchasing tickets, we had to take an electronic trolley to get to the security checkpoint. That is one thing about all the places I have been in India – there is often a security checkpoint. Women go on one side and men go on another. Usually for the pat downs they have the women go behind a screen. Upon getting through security, we were ready to

enter the outer gates of Taj. We came through the East gate. The man who built Taj had four wives – he built a gate for three of them and then the one he loved the most, he built the Taj Mahal. The white parts one the gates and the Taj itself are a special type of marble found in Agra. The black is not paint, but actually onyx. When you look at the Taj, the writing on the bottom is at a smaller dimension that at the top in order to create an obstacle illusion that all the inscriptions are the same size to someone reading it on the ground.

Another interesting thing at Taj, it the local people, push getting a professional photo of oneself in front of Taj for 100 rupees. Luckily, our guide said he could just do that for free and on our own cameras, so we wouldn’t have to wait for the pictures to get printed. After passing through the outer gates, we were able to get our fist glimpse of Taj. It was spectacular. We took pictures in all the right places, doing all the fun things. It was nice that we

were able to have the guide to do that and not to have to bother with the locals. The Taj was completed in 1653 – there are 16 gardens and 53 fountains.

To enter the Taj Mahal itself, we had to put cloth coverings over our shoes and climb a few stairs. I don’t know if it so much for respect of the structure as it is to keep it clean and the marble shiny. The Taj Mahal holds the tomb of the beloved wife, and after the husband died, he was buried there too.

The detail on the Taj Mahal itself is very intricate and beautiful. The colors all come from various stone – lapis, malachite, onyx, marble. There is also a beautiful orange stone called the fire of India and when light hits it, it looks like a flame. The way the designs are inlaid in the marble, is a family secret, protection of the secret is akin to the Coke recipe. The same families that migrated in the 1600’s to work on the Taj are still in Agra today, practicing many of the same techniques that were used back then. Everything is just passed down,

via the males of the family – generation to generation.

After leaving the Taj Mahal, we stopped at a family location where the marble inlaying is still done. To be honest it was a little freaky and I felt like I was about to be sold into the sex trade. There were all these men and us three women. We were able to watch them work and it was pretty intricate how they were creating the designs. Then, they brought us into the back room and I for sure thought we were done…but, there was a TON of more designs to purchase. All were very beautiful and VERY expensive and heavy. I was NOT going to buy anything there. After, one of the ladies was conned into buying something she didn’t want, we were off for lunch.

Lunch was served at a very high end hotel in Agra. It was a buffet, which a bunch of stuff that had a lot of spices. I stuck to a lot of rice and nan. I tried a few things. The first thing I tired was something with spinach and potatoes and BOY was it SPICY!

After lunch, we stopped
P1010014
A close up of the gate
at a jewelry store to see some jewels as well. The star of Agra is a rose colored stone and when light hits it, it makes a six point star. Another jewel is the star of India which is black and when light hits it, it creates a four point star. The place was way overpriced and I was getting pressure from everyone to purchase something. So, I got a pair of earrings. I haggled a little, but was a little annoyed so I caved at $85 USD, but they are very beautiful. To further support my justification, I can only get them in India.

Our next stop on the tour was the Agra Fort. The fort is extremely large and a lot of it is still used for military operations. Only about 20% of the fort is still open to the public to view. The man who built the Taj Mahal was imprisoned at the fort by one of his sons. In the Fort there was a lot of the red sandstone which is prevalent in Delhi and in the inner part, there is a lot of the marble and similar Agra inlay designs as were at the
P1010021
Getting ready to enter
Taj Mahal. Another cool thing about the fort was all the marvelous views one could see of the Taj – which truly is an elegant structure.

Lucky for us, our tour was done after the fort. I say lucky as It was so hot, humid, sticky. All I wanted to do was take a shower and go to bed. Our trip back into Delhi was no eventful. However, it was pretty cool to see the country side. Every now and then we’d see people cross the expressway. I am still trying to figure out where these people were coming from or going to. It was also interesting to see the various villages and just take in everything. We did run into some road construction – they were hand painting the lane lines and the shoulder –hand painting! Upon arrival back into the city, we ran into a traffic jam. And were literally stopped for a good 45 minutes. I was surprised to see so many people in the city on a weekend evening as in the US, a lot people tend to leave the city after a work week. Saket was jammed back and our driver dropped me at

Here you can see the script
my hotel first. It was nice to get back. I called Shweta to ensure my driver would pick me up as I would need to leave my hotel by 5 am to catch my flight to Bangalore. Needless to say, it was an early night for me.

Kathmandu to Dharamsala. Three days in transit. Three buses, two trains, one night in a horrible hotel in India's sex trafficking capital. Hectiness. Heat. Organised chaos. Single very white female walking the streets of India alone with no train ticket. Near breakdown. Somehow amongst the chaos that very alone, very out of place female managed to play the poor innocent white girl card and obtain VIP status for a ticket on what was, at the time, a full train to Lucknow. Western girl in traditional clothing turning up to a Western shopping mall in an Indian city, with the locals wearing western clothes.I think you call that irony. Top bunk in AC3 for an overnight journey with lovely company. Free Indian food from a lovely family and then falling asleep with a blanket on because the air conditioner is freezing. Waking up with wandering eyes looking my way. Smiling at the brilliance of the Indian train system, at the hecticness of the unspoken organisation. Smiling at the beauty in the train walking, food vendors; serving chilli mixes from laundry buckets with dirty hands and dirty moustaches. Wishing I could eat delicious smelling food, because despite the dirty hands part and the

million bacteria that no doubt lie within, it looks and smells delicious. Eye off every mouthful the slightly overweight, middle aged man sitting next to me devours. Enjoy having the top bunk, it means less people, less men, peering at you. Although in AC3 the likelihood of said men staring is decreased by about 50%. Enjoy having top bunk until I cannot sleep anymore. The space between the mattress and the roof is less than, well let's just say there's not much room, in fact the space between the mattress and the ceiling is inadequate for sitting in an upright position. The train journey finishes with a final early morning nap in Pathankot. My three day journey is almost over, almost.

Arrive in Pathankot, a white girl, in Pathankot, whiter than white, tired, hot and unsure of where to go next. I hop on a rickshaw and try to think 'skinny' or 'light' for the at least 70 year old man peddaling in front of me. The lady at the office told me to get a rickshaw to the bus station and a bus to Dharamsala, of course I listen to her. Turns out I could walk. For over

thirty minutes I find myself stuck in the hot sun waiting for the faulty boom gate to open up. There are people working together to move their motorbikes and rickshaws over the railway tracks but we stay waiting, in the hot sun. Eventually we move. There are foreigners behind me, from Tibet. They look hot too. We turn up, literally no more than 500 meters from the train platform. Should have walked because after all of that waiting around I've arrived at the side of a road, outside of a shop, literally a stone's throw from the station. This is definitely not a bus station. An argument breaks out between the hindi speaking Tibetans and the rickshaw drivers. Everything turns out okay. We're not at a bus station and we're most likely going to be getting on a 'friends' contract bus but there will be a bus coming to take us to Dharamsala. An hour later and we're off. Between the man wanting to sit next to me when there were over 30 empty seats and the man breathing far too heavily over my seat, the start was a little uneasy but eventually I managed some stilted sleep amidst the
my first indian train ride
crazy rally car driving from the coach driver. A couple of hours outside of Dharamsala, during the crazy rally driving, I was fortunate enough to share one of the most interesting conversations so far on my travels. The conversation was with one half of the Tibetan couple from the 'bus station'. Khar has been living in India for the past seven years. He is studying Buddhist Philosophy. He was born in China. In any other part of the world he would still be able to class himself as a Chinese national, but Khar was sent to Tibet when he was 16, by his parents, for a 'better' life, and to gain a better education in Buddhist Philosophy. Basically, what happened next stirred emotions up inside of me that I've never experienced. Anger, disbelief, compassion, horror, sadness. Khar wasn't/hasn't been allowed back into China since. He has not seen his parents, nor his brothers and sisters for over ten years. He now holds a Tibetan passport, and classes himself as a Tibetan national. He will never be allowed back into China. My mind was, is, still boggled at the sense, or lack there of, behind this rule. I mean, how can

anyone, how can any country, have the power to refuse entry to a national citizen. How can a country pick and choose who they let in. How can they refuse entry to someone that was born inside their own country, turn away one of their own. I still think about this conversation and wonder if Tibet will ever regain power. Will the Tibetan's ever be free?

India is full of surprises. It is beauty in hardship. Unspoken organisation in chaos. Slums and wealth. Crowds and noise and a dirtiness you will not experience anywhere else. It is incredible scenery; lush landscapes and the foreverness of desert. It is religion and acceptance, happiness and pain. It is its people. It is everything and nothing like I expected.

Buses and trains, rickshaws and motorbikes, trucks and bicycles. India in transit. Some of the best and worst hours of my life. Always slow and always surprising. It is strange men staring, intrigued women caring, children peering and babas begging. It is loud music, wind blowing in your face, bad smells, sweaty thighs. It is roadside eateries, horns and road blocks. It is no suspension in the seats, tossing and turning, sweaty

lips and wandering thoughts. It is beauty in chaos. It is India in transit and I wouldn't swap it for a thing.

taj hotel and pool
the year 2005, i am struggling to cope with personal and professional failures, I also have health issues and the fact that I have a weight problem doesn't help at all. my dad suggests a quick trip to Varanasi during the durga puja, navratri holidays. my dad works out a package with the Taj in Varanasi and it's probably a three night package with breakfast and airport/railway transfers, a half day sightseeing trip is included in it.

We leave from Howrah and i carry my swimsuits so I can swim in the pool there. the car is waiting for us at the Varanasi station, as far as I remember the station is at Gaya and we cross the Ganges to reach Varanasi and the Taj. We check in and I share the room with my folks on an extra bed. The hotel is lovely, the grounds very beautiful, only the swimming pool is under renovation. We proceed towards breakfast and then take a buggy ride around the hotel. I do recall over eating at the scrumptious and lavish breakfast spread.

the hotel has a stall selling artefacts right in the lobby and I would buy a wooden picture frame
taj lobby
in which I have kept mum's photograph in my Bangalore home. Our sightseeing trip takes us to another part of town to the Maharajas residence. He is the only Brahmin Maharajah of India and we believe the royal families of India to be descendants of the Sun God. They are Kshatriyas by caste and intermarry to retain their purity of blood. The palace is by the river and here the Ganges has entered her middle course and cities like Varanasi and Allahabad at the confluence of the rivers Jamuna and Ganges are considered very holy cities in India. We taste some very rich lassi steeped with malai and then proceed towards the Banaras Hindu university. The seat of scholars from past it is still revered as an ancient and enlightened University. one of the evenings we go to the river front to see the evening prayers being offered known as the sandhya Arati. the view of the banks from the river should be beautiful too as you take in the sight and sound of evening prayers, lamps being lit and priests chanting and offering arati. the banks are very crowded and we stay for some time before returning to the hotel.

i discover the joys of a modern treadmill and gym and try to work out regularly after the hearty meals. One of the mornings we go to the Mahadev temple, the most famous landmark and sacred site in Varanasi to offer prayers and I pour water on the shiva linga to pray for a good husband!! we shop a bit outside and i pick up some clothes, pajamas and tshirts for my brothers. mum buys a saree, the very famous silk sarees from Varanasi. i also buy a bangle box for myself and my friend, some pretty pink and white glass bangles. my mum has some glass bangles from here too and once upon a time they were a favourite buy from here. i also bought two kurtis, a fashionable short shirt one can wear over a pair of trousers and one that hides our Indian waistline. one of them was with the famous chikan work of Uttar Pradesh and its a light green to add to the collection of pastel chikan wear i own, most of them from these parts.after the temple darshan or viewing we are stressed as its very crowded and generally there's a lot of pushing and pulling as is the case with all famous Hindu temples. we return to the hotel and it seems to me that I'm staying in a taj hotel after decades. it's so refreshing and relaxing.

in the evening we stroll down to Nadesar House opposite the Taj and it is this beautiful palace now converted to an emporium. we take in the silver jewellery and the hanging portraits of the Maharajah and his family. the Nadesar Palace has now been converted to the second Taj property. my friend had also told me about the gorgeous benarasi silk sarees that Taj can arrange for you to buy from but we refrain from that since I already possess many of them. the taj property was an erstwhile palace now bought by the hotel after most of the maharajas converted their palaces to hotels post the abolition of the privy purse by Indira Gandhi, then Prime Minister of India as well as the land ceiling act and various other loss of privileges by the royal families. they remain royal in our hearts though.

the next morning I wake up to mum praying to the Sun known as Surya pranam and then we go back to the temple and to the river for a boat ride. We cruise down the Ganges and pass many houses owned by several Hindu maharajahs as it was the norm for all of them to own a house in Varanasi. I do recall the architecture of the Nepal Maharajahs house on the banks of the river. Also on the banks of the river is my family guru's ashram and we go there for lunch on Ashtami day, the middle and most powerful day of the 5 day Durga puja celebration. we may have seen a couple of idols too and my father managed to have a cycle rickshaw run over his feet. i nurse him back to recovery in the hotel and on one of our walks we strolled into an antique store and dad bought this amazing statue of a mother and a child.

my ancestor used to own several houses in Varanasi at one point of time and i have even heard the number 26 being quoted. they housed members of his family who were widowed and who according to norm would spend the remaining of their life in houses in Varanasi wearing white clothes, shaving off their hair and eating vegetarian food only. i must mention the movie Water by Deepa Mehta in this connection, a most horrific but poignant and introspective look into the widows of Varanasi or Kashi. so the story goes that cow herds were used to capture these houses and my grandfather had singlehandedly managed to renovate and maintain one house. we went to see the house and I didn't think much of it although it is in the Bengali tolla or street of Varanasi and one of the inhabitants seemed to know exactly where it was. a movie by satyajit Ray revolving around Varanasi, durga puja and the bylanes of the city all with a sinister twist added to it is a must watch. The lanes narrow enough to hold one bull standing on it are also something to add to your must-watch list in Varanasi.

I do remember childhood memories of my grandmother and aunt, sometimes accompanied by her family leaving for Varanasi and a servant would be towed along for their stay. We would be regaled with laughter at some of the stories of monkeys attacking him and sometimes locking him in. i remember receiving gifts of sweet supari and masala, lacquer bangles, glass bangles, a holy shawl and payals, waistbands made of white metal. some of which i still own.

we had almost come to an end of our trip and the same car would take us back to the station for our overnight journey back to Kolkata. my mum would pick up pill boxes and she would give me one of them. i also picked up a brass bell which stands with the bell i bought in uttarakhand.

the very last moment my mum and me walked down to a shop behind the hotel and i find such exotic stuff, a silk bag, cushion covers for my grandmother and me, a silk stole and mum bought some more gift items. they were exquisite and they cost me 100 rupees each. so very happy with the loot we return to Kolkata for what remained of the durga puja celebration.

over the years i would get more gifts from Varanasi, similar pill boxes, a very pretty stone locket, another silk stole and a lacquer bangle. now that i write about it it makes me want to go there again. now that i had found the husband i had so prayed for at the temple there.

Sunrise on the Ganges
Not pretty, but spectacular
Today's entry is written by our guest blogger, Leo Pavliv.



After a really thorough shower removing the parts of the Ganges and Kashi that stuck to us the night before, we woke up at 4:15, well before the crack of dawn, to observe the sunrise rituals. We were ahead of most of the traffic on the roads into Kashi and were dropped off with our guide at the main entrance. As we started our descent back into the winding streets and narrow passages, our guide quickly cautioned us that we would now be seeing it dirty and it might smell a bit. We looked at each other not imaging how it could be much worse than we saw and smelled the evening before. Most of the shops were still closed but a number were starting to open and the guide bought Michelle a small string of pretty tiny flowers that smelled like jasmine. This came in handy several times as she used it to help mask some of the less than pleasant odors we crossed.

We made it through the alleys arriving back at the main Ghat where we watched the amazing ceremonies the night before. We
Morning walk through Kashi
carefully got back into another seaworthy boat with the oars tied in by weathered pieces of cloth. Somehow the boy taking us out on this morning’s “cruise” skillfully maneuvered the boat from the shore pushing through and against all the other boats tied up in essentially a pile on the river bank. We went up and down the Ganges with the guide explaining where different kings had built their homes or where celebrities like the Beatles stayed when they went through their Hari Krishna stage. There were more people lining the shoreline “washing” themselves in the river and saying their morning prayers to the mother river. It was quite peaceful at sunrise but the humidity was certainly on the rise and quite warm outside. We also paddled past the main area where cremations were already occurring. One of the workers was halfway in the water, straining the area where the ashes were being dumped, looking for what might be salvageable from the ashes. His supervisor was watching, making sure no gold fillings wound up in his pocket. The Dom Raja does very well for the lowest of the castes.

We were guided back to shore and walked back through
Brocade loom with pattern
the alleys again en-route to the oldest and most central temple to the Hindu religion. On the way we passed more open stores selling a wide variety of goods, sidestepping many “obstacles” which Michelle utilized that flowers given to her earlier that morning to help mask. Yes, it could actually be dirtier than the night before. I forgot to mention that those obstacles were also washed off into the Ganges not far from the people bathing for the morning rituals. We made it to the temple just before the larger morning crowds were entering. This was a secure area, requiring all metal objects being dropped off before entering. The temple itself was rather small but with much made of gold. While the start of Hinduism is here, the original temple was converted into a mosque during one of the reigns of the invading mogul kings. Several hundred years later, the new (many hundreds of years old) temple was built and is still the heart of Hinduism. We took turns viewing the temple and during my turn, Michelle waited in one of the clean stores selling aryuvedic oils, selecting several to bring back.



We ended the morning maneuvering our way through a number of more alleyways until we came out to the central road and found our car waiting. We then took a civilized and air conditioned ride back going through one of the major universities in the cities. It was neat, clean, green, with a large number of academic buildings, not too unlike what we see in the US. It was so incongruous to what we just experienced a short while ago. Our morning ended at yet another shop where we helped support the local economy. We watched the weave intricate brocade fabric. So ended our pretty amazing 24 hours in Varanasi.

2013-06-21 04.23.47
Travel from Jaipur to Varanasi was easy. Only 2 flights connecting through Delhi. By the end of this trip, Delhi Airport will be as familiar as RDU.

Describing our 24 hours in Varanasi is difficult. Our guide, Aman (a university trained anthropologist), called his city “The Real India”. It was simultaneously real and surreal. We were at turns amazed, humbled, horrified and enchanted. Varanasi cannot be seen, it can only be experienced. All our senses were engaged (willingly and unwillingly), sometimes overwhelmed. The sights and sounds we attempted to capture in video and still photographs. The taste, smell and spiritual senses will be tougher to convey. Pardon the long post, but again, this blog is as much for Leo and I as it is for our readers. I want to jot down as many details as I can to help preserve our memories. Any cultural references I make are as explained to us (or understood by us) from our guide(s). The information may, or may not be complete or correct, but it is what I will remember.

Our first afternoon started out simple enough. We had a few hours between being dropped off at our hotel (Taj Gateway Varanasi)
2013-06-21 04.44.01
and being picked up by our guide for our afternoon/evening tour. Having been in India for a week, we felt brave enough to wander off the hotel grounds and explore the local environs. At no time during our trip have we felt threatened or unsafe from the people around us. Traffic is another issue completely. Walking along the nonexistent sidewalks or crossing the road, is truly frightening (this is coming from a gal who was born and raised in NYC!). What we discovered, India is just as dirty up close as it is from the view in the backseat of our car. The crowds of people, sights and smells are just more intense. Our walk lasted about 40 minutes. That was enough. I did however; get the chance to snap that shot of a motorcycle parked alongside a cow (or visa versa).

Back in the safety and cleanliness of our hotel, we went exploring. Our experience in India’s luxury hotels has been wonderful. The staff is overly attentive (more on this in other post). Here, a hotel employee was anxious to show us the mango trees growing on their property. Before we knew it, we were accompanied by a
2013-06-21 06.57.43
small entourage of hotel staff including the maitre de, the head chef, chief gardener and one or two others. Leo had the chance to pick some mangos from a tree that the chef would later use to make us something to eat. We also got to view their vegetable garden used to prepare dishes for the restaurant. The mango smoothie was amazing!

After Aman came and got us, we began our tour at the Temple of India. It felt more like a small museum, but he explained it is a sight where people can come to worship Mother India. Basically, it was a large room built in 1919 with a large topographical map built to scale of the Indian Sub Continent made from marble. We got a great geography (one of my favorite subjects) and anthropology lesson.

Our driver dropped us at the edge of the famous part of the city known as Kashi. On an average day, 20,000 pilgrims visit Kashi. Eighty percent of them to either cremate or spread the ashes of their family members. Just a few months prior to our visit, was the festival of xxxx. During this time 20 million people descended on
2013-06-21 07.00.53
Varanasi to worship in the Ganges. The numbers are staggering.

We started out on the broad crowded streets on the periphery of Kashi and steadily moved towards the river through increasingly narrow streets, alleyways and footholds. The shops sold clothing, toiletries and a myriad of assorted other items. There were many food vendors, preparing good smelling, good looking food that we dare not sample. The hygiene was not up to our standards (or even close) and the heat of the food was beyond what we could tolerate. As we entered deeper into the winding alleyways (thank goodness we had someone who knew the way) the wares in the shops changed. Now it was incense, shrouds, flowers, wood and many religious icons. As we got closer to the river, there were multiple ashrams, and temples. There were many bald men and few women. (Oh yeah, plenty of cows). We saw several Sodus (self proclaimed prophets) and Gurus (teachers – bringing souls from darkness to light). Upon hearing some chanting, our guide rushed us up to the balcony of a nearby Ashram where we could witness pallbearers carrying a bamboo pallet with the saffron colored shrouded body of a loved one
2013-06-21 07.01.13
down to the river.

As we emerged from the part of the Kashi nearest the river GangaJi (anglicized to Ganges by the British), we witnessed several ritual cremations being done. The pallbearers dip the shrouded body in the Ganges and then allow it to drain for 20 minutes. The saffron shroud is discarded (a white shroud remains) and the body is laid upon a pile of wood and then topped with more wood. The fire is lit by the oldest surviving male child of the deceased (the head mourner has his head shaved prior to lighting the fire). For the next 2.5 hours the fire is attended to by the Dom to keep it hot and burning well. The attending male family members, just ‘hang around” waiting for the cremation to finish. To the casual observer, it feels rather callous.

While we were there, there were at least a dozen cremations ongoing. Surprisingly there is no offensive smell. In addition to the 600 pounds of wood used for each cremation, they add a small amount of sandalwood, clarified butter and herbs to the fire. For whatever reason, this nullifies the awful smell of burning flesh. Any parts of
2013-06-21 07.19.10
the skeleton not consumed in the flames (hip bones of women and ribs of men) are casually tossed into the Ganges and later collected by the city for further disposal. On an average day, there are 250 cremations at this site.

The flame tender, the Dom, is a member of the lowest of the lowest caste in Indian society. It is an undesirable job handed down through generations. The Dom Raja (Fire King) is the person who owns the eternal flame and sells it to all the mourners at whatever price he sees fit. The eternal flame has been burning for thousands of years and was started by the God Shiva. The Dom also has the unenviable task of sifting the ashes to collect any non consumed valuables (think gold teeth) to give to the Dom Raja.

In the Hindu faith, being cremated on the banks of the river Ganges, or having one’s ashes spread into the river by a Brahmin priest during a soul prayer, ensures the achievement of Moksha, the ultimate salvation in the Hindu religion. For this reason, there is no sadness or tears evident at these death rituals. It is also the reason that
2013-06-21 07.19.32
no women attend these ceremonies (they presumably cannot hold back their tears). While watching these ceremonies, I felt reverent and also like an interloper. I felt as if I may have been invading a private family matter that did not concern me. Like a voyeur at a funeral.

Glad to be out of the maze of alleys in the Kashi, we walked along the Ghats on the river. Being early (or prior to the start) of the monsoon season, the Ganges was low. According to our guide, over the next few weeks, all the steps on the Ghats as well as the flood plains on the other side of the river will be covered with water. Along the riverbank we saw, people swimming, children playing, people bathing, men having their heads shaved, cows hanging out, people praying, people doing yoga, tourists snapping pictures and people tossing garbage into the river. Leo and I found it hard to understand how carelessly the pilgrims and residents treat what they deem to be one of the holiest of places.

We walked along to the main Ghat where we boarded a small, very old, much rotted looking row boat (seaworthy did NOT
2013-06-21 07.32.37
come to mind). From here we viewed the previously mentioned sites from a discreet distance providing a new perspective. We watched the sunset over Kashi and saw the flames of the cremations against the darkening sky. We both placed a dish with flowers and candles into the river as we made a wish for the health and happiness of our family. (We were both extremely cautious not to touch the river!)

We disembarked our ‘cruise’ at the main Ghat in time to watch the pilgrims gather for the daily ritual of Thanksgiving held at 8 PM each evening. This was another feast for our senses. We watched as seven young Brahmin priests, performed ritual adulations while singers chanted Hindu music, incense and smoke burned and bells rang to energize the spirits. It felt quite magical to witness this remarkable ceremony. Our guide helped us to view this from a balcony above and then moved us to a position just beneath one alter.

Our guide rushed us to a bicycle rickshaw and led us out of Kashi to our waiting car prior to the end of the ceremony as to avoid getting caught in the large rush of people.
2013-06-21 07.37.43
Good thing as our pick up the next morning was to be at 4:30 AM so we could witness sunrise and its associated rituals along the Ganges.

The Taj Mahal
Goodbye Delhi, hello Agra. We left the National Capital Territory and headed for the state of Uttar Pradesh. We were lucky to travel along India’s newest highway the Yamuna Expressway. Opened only 8 months ago, this road provides a link between Delhi and Agra at a speed of 100km/hr. Along the drive we were an agricultural area and the local industry of brick making, a pollution intensive industry.

Upon arrival in Agra, we once again reentered chaos. The roads are a hodgepodge of cars, motorcycles, bicycles, oxen and people carting various loads in every imaginable way. We met our new guide (whose name we never quite got) at the entrance to the Tomb of Itmad-Ud-Dualah. Also known as the “Baby Taj”, it is similar in design (built before the Taj Mahal), but smaller in scope and materials than its more famous neighbor. The Tomb is built primarily of red sandstone with inlaid marble accents and lattice screens. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir’s queen to honor her parents.

Our next site was the Agra Fort, a massive complex built in 1565 by the great Mughal Emperor, Akbar. This extremely fortified city (2 moats, 2 walls, with too
Agra Fort
numerous to count stations for soldiers), was an impressive site as you imagined life here almost 500 years ago. In this fort the Shah Jahn (The Emperor who built the Taj Mahal), was imprisoned by his son, for squandering state funds on his lavish monument. During our visit, the skies opened up and the rain poured down. While taking cover from the sudden downpour, we sat for almost and hour with our new guide. We learned about his Muslim family and Indian traditions; Marriage, work, family and living arrangements (arranged with a substantial dowry provided by the bride’s family, 9 of his family members are guides, his brother just got married, so his marriage will wait for a few years and his extended patriarchal family all lives together in one home).

We checked into our hotel, The Gateway Taj, to dry off, and rest before continuing on to the star attraction. Fortunately for us, our room has a direct view of the Taj Mahal. Unfortunately for us, it was raining so hard our view was obscured.

Freshly dried off, we headed off to India’s star attraction, its Crown Palace (literally), the Taj Mahal. Getting into the complex was
Welcome to the Taj (okay goodbye)
Our wet drummers greet us after our visit to the Taj
an adventure itself. No cars are allowed in the nearby vicinity. So our driver dropped us near a horse drawn rickshaw where we trotted off down another busy street. We pushed our way through the crowds (it was REALLY packed). We learned the polite American style of waiting your turn, gets you nowhere in India. If you want to make forward progress, you must put your head down and assert yourself through the crowd.

Lucky for us, the skies had cleared slightly, allowing us to view the Taj Mahal without rain pouring down. Although designed to view against a bright blue sky, we saw it was stunning as well against a charcoal grey backdrop. Going on a Sunday was unfortunate, as the throngs of people, interfered with the view and made standing and admiring this magnificent mausoleum difficult.

From a distance, the gleaming white marble, stunning symmetry and fine lattice work were beautiful to admire. Up close, the intricacies of the marble lattice were even more impressive and the inlaid marble work with multiple semi precious stones (more on that later) was gorgeous.

Upon leaving the center of the monument with the tombs of the Shah Jahan

and his Queen, the skies once again opened up and we were drenched through and through. Although the cooling rain felt good, we were concerned for our camera and cell phone’s safety. We took cover as soon as we could under a covered walkway along with hundreds of India families doing the same. We enjoyed people watching and seeing children delighting in playing in the rain. There are many young lovers who come to the Taj as a romantic site. Designed as a monument to the love of his life, the Emperor Shah Jahan built this monument as a testament to his love for his Queen, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childbirth with her 14th child. They had 6 live births (3 girls and 3 boys) and their one son, murdered the other 2 to insure his place on the throne. (Don’t you wish you were Royal?)

On our trek back to our horse drawn rickshaw, Leo & I laughed at a site I can only imagine you would see in India. In the pouring rain (hence no picture) there was a motorcycle parked under a tree alongside two bored, likely parked as well, oxen. Oh I wish I could have taken a photo. Our guide had arranged for a drummer and horn blower to greet us at the Taj, but timing being what it was, they met us after our visit. Seeing these 2 young men standing in the rain, we felt obliged to get out of the car and dance alongside while the serenaded us with their “music”.

Our day finished with some very expensive shopping at the government run shops for local craftsman making products specific to Agra. We were shown how the beautiful inlaid marble was made. We watched the artisans hand cut the stones for the inlaid designs. We delighted at seeing the translucent quality of this very special artwork. Then we went to an embroidery shop were we view the stunning work again made by local craftsmen. Samples of these products will be on display at our home in a couple of weeks/months.

Today was a memorable, albeit wet day. I hope tomorrow is drier, although much of the day will be spent in a car traveling to our next destination.

We left for Agra around 8:35 Am. Thirty minutes of driving closer to outskirts, it started drizzling. Driver ""Thakurji' had to stop and cover the luggage with tarp. it is called highway with tolls. But there are small cities/villages that completely slow down your progress. Since we had a great breakfast, we decided not to stop for lunch. That put our arrival time at 1:30 PM. But the rain slowed us down and we were able to reach radisson Blu only by 2 PM. This is a fabulous hotel. We were delayed a bit at the front desk because of the crowd. In each of the hotels we stayed there is quite a bit of security check of your bags, you and the vehicle. They do it very politely. Our clothes had gotten wet because of the luggage on the rooftop of the vehicle. So we spent sometime drying them in the hotel room. We freshened up in the room and were ready by 3:15 PM. Guide Nadeem was waiting in the lobby. He spoke perfect English and was very legible and clear. Since there was a threat of rain, he siggested that we finish Taj Mahal first and sightsee the Agra fort next morning. If we finish Taj Mahal before 5:30 PM we could go to fort as well on the same evening. We were only 1.2 km from TM. They do not allow any motorized vehicle near other than electric cars operated by Govt and private vendors. After security check rct, Nadeem requested us to look at our feet while crossing a threshold from where one could view TM. As soon as we crossed, he requested us to look up This is one of the spectacular sight you will see in your life! Even though it was cloudy, the imposing building looked so majestic! We took multiple pictures from various angles. Since our guide has been working in this business for 9 years, he knew where to get prime shots. He seemed to be well versed with Mughal history and all of us were asking multiple about that period. He was able to respond to all us with excellent stories attached. There was long line to see their tomb ans we were not that keen since the inside is not as impressive! He took us around and explained every little detail about the building, construction etc. It was close to 5 PM and it started pouring again. We were able to stay in a covered area opposite to TM. He was able to keep us engaged with stories of Akbar, Birbal, shah Jahan etc.By the time the rain ended it was 6 PM. We decided to go to the fort the next day. Nadeem took us to two other places Marble cutting and art work store and the precious stone store. Very good demonstration of how inlays of semi-precious stones are embedded in the There are families that continue to live and work in the business as descendants of original artists of 1700 AD. By the time we finished the tour it was 8 PM. We were tired and wanted to head back to the hotel. We decided to have our dinner in the hotel itself. Kids had seen Pizza in the menu. There were 3 types of dinner service there. One is general buffet, the other is Indian restaurant and the third is a-la-carte menu. We decided to go for individually ordered items. Kids had pasta and Pizza, while we had hakka noodles and Dum biriyani. It was very good. The waiter surprised us by providing Pethas (very popular sweet item made of pumpkin) for free! We came back to our rooms and repacked since we were leaving agra to Jaipur the next day. Our plan next morning was to complete the fort early before 11 am and head to Jaipur. On the way we have to see ""Fatehpur Sikri"" as well.

Taj Mahal, Agra
Northern view from across the river Yamuna

The Taj Mahal: Symbol of India, architectural jewel, and monument to a grand passion. Built in the 17th century by the Great Mogul Shah Jahan in honour of Mumtaz Mahal, the love of his life. Before she died, legend says, Mumtaz Mahal made a wish for a mausoleum, more sublime than any the world had seen. Built on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, it is said to have required over 20,000 workers including the best craftsmen of the Empire. Millions of bricks were baked on site only to disappear forever under flawless white marble. A heavenly memorial to the Queen of the World, or as a poet described it: ""A tear drop on the cheek of time"". A love poem set in stone and the most perfect building in the world.
National Geographic: Secrets of the Taj Mahal


In 1631, emperor Shah Jahan was grief-stricken when his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, died during the birth of their 14th child. Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632, one year after her death. The court chronicles of Shah Jahan's grief illustrate the love story traditionally held as an inspiration for Taj Mahal. The principal tomb was completed in 1648 and the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. The whole complex took more than 20 years and 20,000 people to build.

For hundreds of years, the Taj Mahal stood as a monument from an emperor to his dead wife. Today, some 3 million people visit the Taj Mahal every year. Still, it can be a magical sight: orange at dawn and dusk, dazzling white at noon, silver by moonlight. The Taj Mahal is open from sunrise to sunset but it is closed to tourists on Fridays. The admission fee is 750 Indian rupees (approx EUR 12). Buses and cars can be driven only to within half a kilometre of the gate; walk the rest or take a golf buggy, horse buggy or a camel.

I will most likely remember these banana pancakes, prepared like a thick, folded crepe with bananas and heaven tucked inside, as being the best food in India. I've had them twice now since I've been here and am currently waiting for a third try. Today is our last day in Varanasi, our last day together before elisa heads home and I head to Delhi to wait for my own jet plane to whisk me away. Elisa was an amazing travel partner and I will be forever grateful she asked me along as a sidekick on this little trip.No Nepal for me, so my trip will be a little shorter as I'm not up for the challenge at this point. Instead I will head home to work further on my studies and on myself as a person. It may be simplistic to say that the Indians seem so calm in the midst of this apparent nationwide chaos, it is, but that is the impression I get. I'd like to take some of that home with me in addition to the rad souvenirs I have.

Today we visited a large Hindu temple for the Hindu monkey god Hamunan, filled with monkeys (no
image
cameras allowed) . Yaya!---monkeys are better to watch than tv. I love watching animals, so India has given me plenty to see, both domestic and feral. Anyways, after narrowly avoiding another monkey beat down we went riverside so I could dip my fingers in the Ganges. Legend says even a drop from the river is enough to wash away all your past sins, so there was absolutely no way I was leaving here without my drop. Elisa had some antiseptic cleaner ready when I returned as we've seen too many people pooping along the banks to take chances. Varanasi is an ancient city, but it is also not for those weak of stomach as there is plenty of poop of the human and animal kind around. I'm not quite sure why this city is like this, it's a weird combination; revering the waters of the Mother Ganges while at the same time polluting her to sickness. Just another contradiction.

I'm glad I came here. In twenty years India will be vastly different. You can see the younger generation choosing western dress, dating rules are changing (as i found out after an Indian told me at as I'm a student
image
i should have at least 3-4 boyfriends, thats how it is on HBO and showtime, ya know?) and more opportunities for school and work. There is good energy here. Thanks or joining me on my trip, I will be in touch.

Seriously, every bus ride I've taken in a developing country is like this: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wuypE6ISPag

I'm typically flopping around, while simultaneously folding myself up origami style, while the local next to me is serene and still. We woke up early to catch a local bus from Allahabad to Varanasi. With no a/c and apparently no shocks, it actually wasn't a bad trip.

The country side is really a sight to see, with most of those in rural India living in extreme poverty. It is really hard to wrap your mind around; the brick kiln towers, agricultural land, dirt floor houses with satellite dishes, just so much.

While travelling you tend to waver between complete culture shock and acceptance, often within the same day, the same hour. India seeps into your bones and just when you think you've gotten things figured out, she throws you something else. In the case of Varanasi, she throws you something amazing.

We arrived and after an interesting (read terrifying-ish) ride to our fabulous hotel we were able to catch a little nap and some great food. Then off on a sunset boat ride on the river Ganges. There have been a few minutes
image
during this trip where I turn to Elisa and ask her to pinch me, like this can't be real and I want to make sure I'm not dreaming. That's how I felt tonight.

The Ganges is truly remarkable, not only for its role in the everyday lives of locals, but its use in religious ceremonies as well. While on our boat ride, our guide expertly maneuvering through the murky water, we saw sights that I will carry with me. The Ganges is very low, waiting now for the monsoon season to swell her up, so we were able to see the ghats (massive sets of stairs leading down to the Ganges) that locals use for access to the water. Hundreds of men and boys were bathing in the river, which is so polluted I didn't even run my hands through its waters - a very un-me thing to do. Do a little research and you will see how this river is polluted to such levels I'm convinced these people just may be the strongest people on the planet, serious, they are nuke-proof, survivors.

We pulled up in front of a ghat where a Hindu ceremony in honor of
image
the dead was taking place. It was quite a sight. The river is believed to wash away the sins of thoSe bathed in it. To die and have your cremains released in the river is to release yourself from the cycle of rebirth. As you look at the pictures you will see the ceremony, swastikas (a peaceful, religious symbol co-opted by those nazi bastards) scenes from the river and us giving an offering to Mother Ganges, asking for help in return. I asked her to send me someone to love and who will love me, though I'm thinking maybe I should have asked for something easier, like world peace.

So what do two women with a free day in Allahabad do? Visit the confluence of the three holy rivers? No. Visit the Akbar fort, no, it's closed to civilians and is used by the military, do I spend time pondering our existence reaching for a higher plane of consciousness? Definitely not, see my previous bumblebeetuna post for an example of my higher thinking abilities.

If you are us you head on over to McDonald's for a crispy chicken sandwich, some French fries and a coke. You notice they do not serve beef or pork products of any kind. Then you shop in the stress free, set price shopping mall where you can find beautiful clothing made with both style and modesty in mind. Then you call it a day.

After the heat index reached 132, plans changed very quickly. And that's how it goes on the road. I read blogs about people filling up every day, actually forcing themselves to do something and then being just completely exhausted when they return from a vacation. Blah on that. I prefer naps and sort of bumbling around a bit, enjoying myself.



Tomorrow we will head out on

We've arrived in Allahabad, a site typically overlooked by tourists, but which should have some interesting sites once we get a little rest and the heat cools a little. We took another night train and this one had its own misadventures, well for Elisa anyways,poor thing. I slept through the night, unaware of some weirdo passenger, pacing the halls and sitting on her. I think the trip was redeemed though when I squeezed her into a tiny rickshaw for the ride to our hotel, good times.

I started to wonder about this town as we started to get closer and I looked out the window and every so often you just see some random dude taking a dump right along the track. it's just weird and random, and I swear this is the only phrase you can even think of when you see it: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kC5Em4BIn-U

Anyways.....

Apparently my heart is still active as it broke a little yesterday when this street dog puppy was crying loudly in front of us. Street dogs are everywhere. They appear to be owned by no one and everyone at the same time. They dig through the garbage for something to eat and

when one of the younger puppies wags his tail you want to pet him, but you don't because it is just too dangerous. You want to help a puppy! It broke my heart to see him limp away.

Oh and in mentioning the trash did I mention it is everywhere? I mean mounds of trash on every street everywhere. The feral dogs, cows and pigs love it and seem to survive off it. Over here they have brahman looking cows and the weirdest thing is I haven't seen a single cat since I've been here.



I think I'm rambling and I've attached a couple of random pics, will check in later.

Taj Mahal, Agra
Day 246 (Sat 11thMay)



Today was probably the day I’ve most been looking forward to from a tourist perspective. I was going on a day trip to the city of Agra, home of the incredibly famous and 1 of the 7 manmade wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal.

My day started with another early morning send off. My train was due at 6am and Amy was due to fly out a few hours later so I said my goodbyes and headed off to the station to get my train. The station is only 5 minutes from my hostel at this time of morning, takes about 15-20 during the day as it’s so busy. It’s weird seeing the streets deserted, the rubbish is everywhere and the smell horrendous. There is an area down a little side street from my hostel where there are a couple of tiles randomly against the wall in a corner, turns out this is the outside public toilet and this was the first time I’ve not seen someone using it. During normal hours there are queues to go in the fly infested corner for a leak, it wouldn’t be so bad but there
Taj Mahal, Agra
are food stalls everywhere, definitely no street food for me.

I had a little issue with my train ticket. I had saved an open internet page on my ipod which decided to reload and close in the station so had no idea of my seat number. I had 15 minutes until it left so wandered up and down the platform looking at the charts pinned to the side of the carriages, finally finding my name on the second to last one. I took my seat and off we went.

Bottles of water were given out and then some breakfast, being some vegetable thing in flour fried, the guy sat next to me told me the name but I’ve forgotten it. It was pretty nice though and came with a small drink and tea and biscuits. I got chatting to the guy sat next to me. He was probably the first Indian to speak to me in 3 weeks or so that wasn’t trying to sell me something or wasn’t serving me. We had a good chat all the way to Agra where I got off and he carried on home.

The usual chaos ensued at Indian Railway
Taj Mahal, Agra
stations of every man and his auto rickshaw trying to get your business. I got one sorted to the Taj Mahal and asked for the quietest entrance. My driver was Shabbu, a Nepalese man and very nice and knowledgeable. He offered me a full day tour of the city and while I probably culd have negotiated each leg and made it cheaper it was handy so I went with him. Also in 43 degree heat the last thing I fancied was constantly arguing over prices to get from one place to the next.

He dropped me of at the south gate and I bought my ticket and went in, with only 1 person in the queue before me. I was met with the main gate in the middle of the courtyard. This must stand 30 metres tall and is a lovely entrance way into the Taj. I was already hugely impressed. When you consider how much of a mess the rest of the country is in, to then see this lovely arch, it’s a good way to start it. I walked towards the arch and read the big tablet explaining all about the Taj and why it was built
Taj Mahal, Agra
etc, this being as a shrine to Shah Jahan’s late ‘favourite’wife. I was told it took 20,000 people working on it daily for around 23 years to complete and I am sure I was told they chopped off the hands of the people who made it so it couldn’t be replicated.

I got to the arch and could see the Taj in the distance, the white marble shining quite brightly in the morning haze which seems to surround every city in India. It seems to take until it reaches around 40 degrees to burn it away and leave the afternoon with a reasonably blue sky. There are also state laws so no factories are allowed within a certain distance, I think it was 100km of the Taj so it doesn’t become too polluted. Anything made inside this area has to be handmade and without the use of machines that would create pollution.

On first view the Taj is simply stunning, it’s quite hard to put into words what it’s like. I just felt in awe of it. It’s 55 metres high and wide, and of perfect symmetry. The place is full of people as you’d expect but it’s
Taj Mahal, Agra
easy enough to get some space to take a decent photo. A guy offered to take a photo of me, so I let him (with my own camera) and then he asked for payment so I told him where to go and moved on. It seems no one does anything for free or for the generosity of it here. I spent around 90 minutes in the grounds taking multiple pictures of it. You can go inside it but there really is nothing to see there. The ‘tombs’ are well covered and not even the real tombs so pretty pointless, just a bit of a show to add to the place I guess.

The Taj really does look like a painting in the background, even when you get to close to it, it seemed hard for me to believe it was real. Even all the pictures I’ve taken, it doesn’t look real. It’s very unique I think in that respect.

After this I headed out and met Shabbu to take me to my next destination, being the Baby Taj. This is not a miniature of the Taj as I thought, more a smaller marble building in the same dynamics
Taj Mahal, Agra
of the Taj, with a 3 entrance gates, a courtyard and perfect symmetry also. It is however a different style, albeit from the same marble, which is locally sourced from Rajasthan I believe. This took only 30 mins or so to look around as there was no one there then it was a short trip around the corner to some gardens I’ve forgotten the name off. This is where you can look at the Taj Mahal from the other side of the river. Now this would be great if there was some water in the river, could go for the nice reflection shot but it’s definitely dry season and water doesn’t survive very long in 43 degrees. The gardens are also too dry and it’s not the best place to be taken this time of year, a month or so ago it might have been a nicer view from there. Also with it being very hazy it’s hard to take good pictures. I took a few and then just realised I failed to transfer them over and deleted them by mistake, luckily they weren’t that good anyways.

After this I was taken for lunch, obviously to the most expensive
Taj Mahal, Agra
place in town. Well maybe not as there are high end hotels but it was in a hotel so was maybe triple what a local place would have been. It was nice and had air con so I wasn’t going to complain. Although there is a guy stood near the toilet who wanted a tip for opening the door for me. I wasn’t impressed by this as I’d just spent over the odds on the food, I just ignored him and walked past. For people back home if a tip is given it is appreciated but I can’t imagine someone lasting long in a job if to every person they served or did something for, they went ‘tip, tip, you give tip’ all the time. Be sacked straight away. A tip is earnt not asked for unless you’re in India. Some staff even point out that a service charge has not been included, so as to point it out so you leave one. I find this annoying.

Anyways in the afternoon I was taken firstly to a few shops as the driver was probably wanting some commission. I was not interested in a Pashmina, who needs a scarf in
Taj Mahal, Agra
43 degrees, neither did I want any jewelry. The marble store was quite cool. I was talked through how it is made and met the guys that on Fridays restore and clean the Taj Mahal. I saw them making some of the smaller souvenirs by hand which were very impressive.

After here I went to Agra Fort, I’d never heard of it until I googled Agra, but wow, what an awesome place. Currently around 75% of it is still patrolled by the military but the remaining 25% is an amazing feat of architecture. Whilst it only took an hour or so to walk around, the fort is simply stunning, I hope the pictures do it justice. There are numerous courtyards with lavish buildings, in red brick and white marble. It is where the empire used to be run from and is like a walled city. The buildings are in such great condition and the renovators must have a job on their hands to keep such a huge area in the condition it is. It is 94 acres in total.

The fort is also a Unesco heritage site along with the Taj and the 2 buildings make Agra a
Taj Mahal, Agra
very special place. The rest of the town is utter chaos and a dump like most of India, suffering from incredible heat, too much poverty and mental traffic but the buildings that are in this city are truly spectacular. I was a week or so ago considering just flying out of Mumbai back to Thailand as I was struggling in India but even though I have not enjoyed the country, having this day trip has mad it worth coming to the country.

After I was done in the Fort I headed back out to meet Shabbu once more. It was still only mid afternoon and my train not until 8:30pm but I’d seen and done everything I wanted too so I asked him to take me somewhere in walking distance of the station that served beer. He dropped me at a little hotel and I went inside and had a beer. Only to start feeling really tired so only had the one then left. I had to wait hours at the station for the train and was constantly approached by drivers saying they could drive me to Delhi instead and it would be quicker, which I know is a
Taj Mahal, Agra
lie. Also when I turned that down they wanted to take me into town, I explained I’d already been in town, but they always have a remark or somewhere ‘better’ to show you. I got fed up of this, so got some food and just waited for my train back on the platform.

I got back to Delhi around 10:30pm and headed to my hostel to get my head down as it’d been a long day. Not often am I spending the whole day sightseeing, sometimes a morning, sometimes and afternoon but normally there is time spent relaxing in the hostel in between, not today however.



Day 247 (Sun 12th May)



This was my last day in India and as my flight was due to leave at 5:30am tomorrow morning I decided a good lie in and a day doing very little, mainly catching up on my blog as I’d been too fed up to do it most of the time in India.

I sorted out my taxi to the airport for 2am, got my lunch, changed $10 into rupees as I’d ever so slightly misjudged how much I needed and then
Taj Mahal, Agra
pretty much relaxed in my room most of the day. I did head out for a walk around to make sure I got some exercise done. I stayed awake all evening and night after a brief thought of a nap and waited for my taxi.

The Taj Mahal is a dream come true. Set in the city of Agra, aka, the city of love, this mausoleum built by Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife is truly one of the few sites around the world that lives up to the hype. Built of beautiful marble, the Indian people work diligently to ensure its beauty remains. You're required to wear booties over your shoes and they don't allow outside food, drink, flashlight, etc. Good for the site, not so good for those puny white girls with wide brimmed doofus hats in the 115 degree heat. I woke up as Bruce banner, the heat had me green before the end of the day --- hulk smash!
Anyways after a quick punch in the face (mental straightening out), I was better able to appreciate India. And there is a lot to appreciate here. Customer service is taken very seriously and I feel very safe. People are incredibly kind and they are not as aggressive sellers which I appreciate so much. Our hotel rooms have ac and breakfast included. The omelettes are made with eggs from these tiny little white chickens that just can't put too much energy

into creating a yolk, poor little things. Animals are skeletal, emaciated and either working, being raised for food or are feral. You are just as likely to see camels as you are water buffalo, cows abound and are referred to as the traffic police by our guide as they randomly appear in traffic. We've seen neel gaie (wild animals I need to research), monkeys, a billion golden eagles, neem trees ( used in beauty products), bougainvilleas in full bloom and much more.

bathing in the ganges
As we exited the Golden Temple of Varanasi, I began to realize that, although I was again on a normal Indian diet of curry, rice and naan, I was still having some slight stomach issues. Klaudia had walked into a jewelry store with Vicky and Roman - the very positive couple we’d met in Khajuraho, she from Azerbajain, he from Kiev, both now living in New York – while I waited outside because I was hot and not in the mood to shop. My stomach grumbled…



“Oh, man… This is it…” I groaned to myself. I quickly walked into the store, gave Klaudia the money in my pocket – leaving myself some in the event I’d have to pay for a bathroom – and went in search of relief.



In short, there was none to be found: I turned left, I turned right, then left again… Nothing… Finally, I spotted a guesthouse and quickly entered the lobby.



“Can I please use a bathroom?” I asked frantically.



“No, manager not here. No bathroom.”



“What does the manager have to do with me using the bathroom?”

ghats


“Manager not here.”



“Please…” I moaned.



“Manager not here.”



I heaved expletives out loud as I left the guesthouse; I noticed a cyber café not far away and proceeded towards it.



“No bathroom,” was the regretful response to my request.



“Where do you go?” I asked.



“At home.”



“Of course you do. Unbelievable...” I heaved more expletives out in the street; the situation was becoming dangerously dire when my context shifted: I’d seen it a hundred times in India already. Why not? So what if I was a tourist? I have to go… I noticed a cow going right at that moment… There were only three little kids around… Who cares what they thought?



“This is it,” I thought as I reached for my belt buckle. Slowly, I undid my belt, but hesitated a moment… I scanned the narrow alleyway I found myself in once more - still only the same three kids, who were now observing me inquisitively.



“Yep, I’ve seen the Indians do this a hundred times already. And I
sadhu
doubt I’m the first tourist to do this… This just can’t wait and it’s going to happen whether I like it or not,” I whispered to myself as I was now grabbing my pants’ button. Suddenly, I heard a “Hey!” and I turned around. A man was waving to me.



“Toilet?!” he yelled.



“Yes!” I replied. We waved to me to come over.



“My home,” he said once I’d run over to him. I thanked him and barged into his house, quickly noticing the dusty concrete floor and the complete lack of furniture except for a TV stand and one wooden rocking chair; a woman in a sari was lying on a mat on the floor with a child; it was very dark. The man led me to an Indian-style toilet; there was no door and it could partially be seen from the living area: if anyone turned their heads from the TV, they could easily see me squatting. “Thank you!” I said again as he walked away to allow me as much privacy as I could have in a one-room home with a toilet with no door.
ganges



“Crap!” I thought when I’d finished: I’d forgotten to take toilet paper with me. “Looks like a totally Indian bathroom experience,” I thought as I looked at my left hand. I was grateful when I noticed soap and washed my hands thoroughly. It saves on paper, that’s for sure.



As I was leaving, the family of three smiled; I reached into my pocket in expectation when the man said, “No,” with a bigger smile. Up to this point, the majority of my dealings with the Indian people was with the tourist industry, which is, simply put, full of chicanery; and I had forgotten that a human being can do something for another human being without seeking reciprocity. I thanked him again while he patted me on the shoulder as I left, both of us laughing (he more boisterously). Walking back towards the jewelry store, I thought, “Yes, if there is a God – and if that God is a vengeful one that created a hell, where he decides to send me – He will give me diarrhea and send me to Varanasi”.



Indeed, Varanasi, India’s holiest city, is the best and the
sadhu
worst of India comingled into one wacky microcosm: it is the filthiest city I have ever seen in my life, yet, in an oddly metaphorical sort of way, is the most colorful; the hassling is absolutely nonstop, but the shopping is great; I’m certain giardiasis is rampant, yet the food is some of the best I’d had in India.



Our time spent there was leisurely: we walked the ghats with Vicky and Roman, watched water buffalo bathe in the Ganges - along with the locals and Sadhus - and Klaudia shopped while I ate. The four of us took a sunset boat ride one night, mesmerized by the fading light on the ghats and the hundreds of lit, floating candles in the river. We lit our own candles and said a wish as we let them go in the river. We visited the esteemed Varanasi University, which had a lovely – and clean – campus and attended the nightly Puja during the evening, amazed at the size of the congregation in attendance that clapped and sang along with the esoteric religious chants. At night, the stray dogs rule the streets as the cows and people sleep.
cremations



Our first day there, we witnessed the cremation of bodies on the ghats. Naturally, people who have not yet been to Varanasi ask us about our impressions of watching a body be cremated on the shores of a river. At this point, after a month of desensitization, one might as well ask me what it’s like to see Indians eat with their hands: it’s just something they do. Put another way, in survey form, which of the following choices do you find most “normal”:

1. Cows are considered holy and you can go to jail for hurting or killing one. They are allowed to roam the streets almost wherever they like and you have witnessed them cause traffic jams on busy streets, defecate everywhere, including near produce stands, and eat burning trash on the side of the road. Miraculously, you have only stepped in cow poop once, but it was really bad that time. As you’re trying to clean your shoes, you’re intrigued by the fact that you have to look out for it in a city.

2. You’re walking along the street minding your own business when, suddenly, a woman runs over to the street
ghats
and, lifting up her sari, releases an explosion of diarrhea on the street within a yard of your feet. You run for your life.



3. Sadhus, or holy men, are everywhere in Varanasi. You learn that there are more than 30 castes of sadhus and that the members of the lowest of these castes spend their time in complete public nudity, rubbing only ash on their bodies. As you’re walking along the ghats, you notice one of these naked holy men and stare a bit - being the heterosexual male that you are, you do your best not to glance down. However, having gone to an American high school where you played some sports, you’ve showered with other boys and know that sometimes the eyes will inadvertently wander. What you’ve never seen though – again, as a heterosexual male – is an erect penis, outside of pornography of course. Well, the sadhu has one… You are embarrassed…



4. You’re walking along the narrow streets of Varanasi when you hear your wife scream. There is a stream of water falling from a balcony. At first you think someone may be watering some plants, but when
sadhu
you look up, you see that it’s something peeing... Perhaps a child? Nope, it’s a monkey that’s peeing on your wife. It’s another Asian monkey attack!



5. Walking along the ghats again, you watch a ritual that is thousands of years old, wherein a family bids farewell to a loved one. Instead of an open casket wake, which has people gawking at a dead body for 3 days, they place the deceased loved one on a large pile of wood and, after a male family member, usually a son, walks around the pile of wood seven times, he sets the wood on fire. The body is reduced to ash, which is then spread in the Ganges River, which the people consider holy. It would not be India if even this ritual was not without, from your viewpoint, some controversy: women are not allowed to attend the ceremony because, as explained to you, they cry too loudly. There are also certain exceptions as to who is cremated and some deceased are simply dropped in the water, such as pregnant women and people with disabilities, the thought being that the former does not need to be burned because she
dogs rule the night
was carrying a being without sin while the latter has suffered enough already. But, as someone who has experienced the death of loved ones, you understand that it’s just a different type of funeral.


Yes, Klaudia got peed on by a monkey and I stepped in cow poop, avoided a dangerous splash of human poop, and tried not to look at an erection. Varanasi’s an interesting place, to say the least. Although I personally think one would have to have a screw loose to live there, I’m not surprised to see foreigners, with some screws loose, living there: it is the spiritual home of India - as wondrous as it is perplexing, as enticing as it is repelling - in the backdrop of a septic river that has possessed a status of holiness for thousands of years.



When it was time to leave – we to Bodhgaya, Vicky and Roman to Rishikesh – we left the narrow alleyways near the ghats and reached a busy Indian road, where we decided to share a tuk-tuk to the train station. As we were negotiating with one the drivers, I noticed I was standing in the street and
random
moved closer to the parked tuk-tuks. My thoughts wandered a bit when I noticed a cool t-shirt; suddenly, I felt a tug on my backpack. I immediately pulled myself forward, but to no avail as the tug strengthened and I was air-born momentarily before crashing on top of a fallen motorcycle. I swiftly stood up and started yelling at the motorcyclist who’d just hit me – India could not kill me with bacteria, so now it was sending in the crazy drivers. Luckily, a policeman showed up to calm me down and the entire situation. The driver’s bike was damaged more than I was, so I let it go.



The four of us crammed into the tuk-tuk and were off to another Indian adventure.

Varanasi Street Scene
The driver is asleep in his rickshaw.
The overnight train to Varanasi was a fourteen hour trip. The mini van got us to Agra Fort station by 8.00pm, in plenty of time to catch the 9.00pm train. Once again, all luggage was piled up and we stood around it. Bishal gave us our carriage and seat numbers and it was up to us to get ourselves aboard. The train stopped for twenty minutes only, so there was no time to waste once it arrived. All luggage had to be stowed in our compartment, and we move as a team, making the boarding process as easy as possible for everyone.

We have air conditioned three tier sleepers, and they come with bedding, the same as the trip from Delhi to Jaisalmer. I have no complaints as to the cleanliness of these trains. They are a little cramped, and if you sit up in bed you'll bang your head, but that's to be expected. The air conditioning has worked well both times but the toilets are smelly and not very nice by the end of the trip. We all anticipate this, so everyone uses the loo before we leave the hotel and travels with tissues and hand sanitizer -
Varanasi Street Scene
problem solved. We also make sure we stock up on water, fruit or snacks, which can be purchased at the station, as no food is available on board.

We arrived in Varanasi at 11.00am, and have all luggage out from under the seats, ready to disembark as soon as the train stops. We were surrounded by the usual swarm of tuk tuk drivers as soon as we leave the station, and Bishal sorted our transport for us. We are squashed in, three per tuk tuk plus luggage, and endure another uncomfortable, and rather long ride to our accomodation, Hotel Haifa. Beats me why an extra tuk tuk can't be hired to take some of the luggage and make the trip a little easier on everyone.

We settled into our rooms and later met for lunch in the restaurant. Wifi here cost 100 rupees ($2) a day and was available only in the lobby. The air con was free, which was just as well as the hotel seemed to have a lot of power outages which, strangely enough, only affected the air conditioning. If we complained often enough it was switched on, only to be switched off again an
Varanasi Street Scene
hour later.

Bishal planned an orientation walk at 5.30pm, but I headed out on my own after lunch. Seems the hotel isn't far from Assi Ghat (steps leading to the river) so I asked directions and found the way myself. But, the heat got the better of me, and I headed back to the hotel, where I showered and slept for the next two hours.

Varanasi is a holy city and one of the oldest living cities in the world, with a continuous history dating back 3,000 to 5,000 years. Today, it retains much of the allure of the ancient world. The center of the Hindu world, Varanasi touts an unrivaled diversity and a unique sense that can be experienced nowhere else.

The banks of the Ganges River, built high with 18th century pavilions, temples and terraces, are lined with an endless chain of stone steps - the ghats - progressing along the whole of the waterfront. It was here that I ventured out during the afternoon and where Bishal took us again for our orientation walk later in the day.

The walk finished at Dasaswamedh Ghat about an hour later. We were just in time

Rundown buildings are in every street scene here.
to watch the Ganga Aarti, a ritual which is held here every night. Ganga Aarti is a show stopper. It starts soon after sundown and goes on for an hour and half. The preparation in the lead up to the Aarti sets the tone for the evening ahead. It all begins with young priests organising their prayer instruments on their respective platforms – all seven of them. Visitors start taking their seats while locals can be seen buying flowers and other items from shops around selling pooja-related stuff.

The big fire lit lamps look beautiful as darkness envelops the area. The group of young priests began proceedings in a well orchestrated manner, synchronizing their movement with lamps in hand, to the rhythmic chants of hymns and beat of cymbals. Loudspeakers, floodlights and the continuous rings of bells further enhanced the drama surrounding the event. It is a spectacle and done with great pomp and show. Many opt to witness the Aarti sitting in a boat on the Ganges, for its lovely visual perspective.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and had an excellent view of the proceedings, from an elevated balcony complete with a plastic chair, which I paid 50

rupees for. Afterwards I walked back to the hotel via the ghats, in the company of one of the men in the group. I wouldn't have attempted it on my own as a lot of the ghats are dimly lit, and we got back to the hotel without any problems.

Bishal had planned a sunrise boat ride on the Ganges for the next morning (Wednesday) so we gathered on the front steps of the hotel at 5.00am. It's an easy walk to Assi Ghat where our boat, shaped like an oversized rowboat, is waiting. Our boatman uses oars and the current to move us down river. Other boats are out as well, but none have motors running. Even in the middle of the Ganges at this early hour we can't escape vendors trying to sell stuff, and boats approach with stock laid out for us to look at and hopefully buy. But we aren't out here to shop and they soon move on.

We drift along the gnats for over an hour, giving us plenty of time to take photos and watch devotees swim, bathe and wash their clothes in the water. We passed the most confronting ghat,
Assi Ghat
A street stall on Assi Ghat.
Manikarnika (also known simply as the burning ghat) which is the place where the majority of dead bodies are cremated in Varanasi.

Hindus believe cremation will liberate them from the cycle of death and rebirth. You'll come face to face with death at Manikarnika Ghat. Piles of firewood line the shore and the fires continually burn with the stream of dead bodies, each wrapped in red and gold cloth and carried through the lanes on makeshift stretchers by the doms, a caste of untouchables that handle the corpses and supervise the burning ghat.

A very sobering sight, which reinforced the cycle of life and death here in Varanasi, and the important part the Ganges River plays, was seeing a bloated body floating face down in the water. We cruised past it, I gasped in shock, but the boatman just kept on going, as if he sees it every day. Other boats would have passed it too. Not a nice sight to start the day with.

Later that morning I tuk tukked to the old city to have a look around. The streets were busy with traffic and pedestrians. It reminded me of Delhi and the chaos in
Bathing in The Ganges
Devotees bath in the river.
the streets there. I enjoyed walking around, admiring the gorgeous saris and other items for sale, and ignoring the calls from vendors when I passed their stands or shops. They all want to make a sale but all I purchased were six mandarins, two of which I gave to a beggar woman. They disappeared into the folds of her sari in the blink of an eye. I wondered what else she might have stashed away in there...

I'm not tempted to buy as I don't want to carry anymore than necessary. I did enquire about the cost of silver jewellery again, but couldn't reach an agreement with the silversmith, who wanted double what I paid in Pushkar, so I didn't buy.

On Thursday morning, I decided to go to the burning ghat, where all the cremations are done, hoping for a closer look. I caught a tuk tuk outside the hotel and he dropped me at Dasaswamedh Ghat, or as close as he could get, as the road was closed to vehicles unless they paid a fee. That was fine, I walked the rest of the way, where I was approached by a man asking if I wanted
The Ganges River
a boat. We agreed on a 300 rupee fare ($5.50) for him to take me to the burning ghat, where he would then wait and bring me back.

As soon as I stepped ashore, I was met by a young man who volunteered to show me around and explain the burning process. He was one of the 'untouchables' who worked there. There was no way I could have walked around by myself. I was the only westerner, and female, in sight.

Only Hindu people are cremated here, and there are three levels where the different castes are burnt, caste meaning the social position of the person. Lower castes are burnt on the lower and middle levels, both being ground level, one a little higher than the other. Upper caste people are burnt on an open air platform surrounded by concrete railings and accessed via steps. This area is in the highest position, and overlooks the others. During the wet season, when the Ganges River rises, all castes have to be cremated here as the lower levels are under water.

On average, 250 people are cremated here every day. Fires burn around the clock and huge wood piles

are everywhere. Lower castes use banyan tree wood and upper castes use more expensive sandalwood. Two bodies were burning when I was there, but there was absolutely no odour of death or burning flesh because of the wood used. I was shown a fire which never goes out. It has been burning for as long as cremations have been held here, and is the fire that every pyre is lit from, using straw to carry the flame. No accelerants are ever used to help start the fires.

No female family members are allowed at this ghat. The pyre is built and lit by the men. Reasons being that women cry and create too much emotion and, in times past, would throw themselves on the burning pyre and die alongside their loved one, a practice which is now illegal.

I was told that the chests of the men don't burn, as they are so strong from work, and the hips of women don't burn as they are strong from childbirth. These bones are removed from the pyre, after burning,and tossed into the Ganges. The family have no claim on the ashes which are shovelled into a pile everyday. These

ashes are then panned in the shallows of the Ganges and any traces of gold, from jewellery mainly, will be salvaged and sold.

I saw a big pile of sandstone slabs which are used to tie bodies to before they are dropped into the Ganges, as not everyone gets cremated here. Holy men, children under ten, pregnant women, cobra bite victims and leprosy victims don't get cremated. Hence the body in the river yesterday - it had probably come undone from its slab and risen to the surface. Nothing will be done about it, it will be allowed to continue drifting with the current and will eventually disappear.

I found the whole process fascinating and could stand and watch a body burn without revulsion. Probably because there was no smell and I know that this has been happening for hundreds of years and will continue to happen for hundreds more. An interesting morning!

I had a very hot walk along the ghats back to the hotel in the midday heat, after being dropped back at Dasaswamedh Ghat by the boatman. I had run out of cash, after paying the boatman and giving a donation to the hospice
Life On The Ghats
at the burning ghat, so had no option but to walk back. I spent the rest of the day close to the hotel, as we were leaving for the railway station at 5.00pm, to catch the overnight train to Kolkata.

The Bharatpur Bus Station
Everyone is waiting for a bus.
We endured another bone breaking trip down that awful road back to the bus station this morning. Bishon warned us to keep a sharp eye on our belongings as we are now in one of the highest crime rate areas in India. I'm a little mistrusting of hotel staff, particularly in the standard of accommodation we've been staying in, so always put valuables, such as my iPad, in my suitcase and lock it before going anywhere. I never leave anything of value within sight.

With this in mind, we all drop our luggage in a pile and stand around it, which we've done at every bus or train station we've passed through. All small backpacks are worn on the front where we can keep an eye on them as well. We have a 2.5 hour trip to Agra this morning, and are the only westerners in the station. We always get curious stares from the locals, I often wonder what they're thinking....

Our bus would have to be the most decrepit we have travelled on yet. The surfaces are so dirty you don't want to touch them, and all the windows have greasy hair oil marks ringed with dirt,
Agra Fort
from people sleeping against them. I try not to notice and push the glass back as far as I can, and get a blast of hot air in my face. It's gonna be another fun trip!

The trip passed quickly and we arrived in Agra in good time. We were dropped on the edge of a local market, after the driver eased his way between the stands. It never ceases to amaze me how they manage to manoeuvre their buses through the tightest of places, and pass other buses, rickshaws and motorbikes without hitting anything. Many a time I've held my breath as we've passed within six inches of a shop awning, waiting to hear a crash, but it hasn't happened yet.

We piled out of the bus, grabbed our luggage and, in single file, followed Bishal down the street and around the corner where a mini van was waiting to take us to our accommodation, Hotel Sheela Inn. The hotel was in a great location, within walking distance to the East Gate of the Taj Mahal. They had free wifi on the roof, but they wanted 400 rupees a night ($7.20) for air conditioning, which is basically

what a night's stay in this establishment is worth, if the rates on display at the front desk are correct. Nobody took them up on the offer, as there are evaporative coolers in the rooms, and we will make do with them.

Bishal had organized with the mini van driver to take us to and from Agra Fort this afternoon, at our own expense. He says it would be cheaper and certainly more convenient for us to do the trip together, than for everyone to pay for separate tuk tuks. Made sense to me and everyone else agreed, and it only cost us 100 rupees each ($1.80).

The fort is a huge red sandstone complex standing on the banks of the Yamuna River. Started in 1565, it took eight years to complete. The Red Fort, and the Taj Mahal, bear an exceptional and complementary testimony to a civilization which has disappeared, that of the Mogul Emperors. Agra's history dates back more than 2,500 years. Entry to the fort cost 250 rupees ($4.50). We had a guided tour, then returned to our rooms to escape the heat.

Later in the afternoon, about 4.30pm, we headed to the Taj
Inside Agra Fort
Mahal, after buying tickets, and getting shoe covers and a free bottle of water from the ticket centre just around the corner from the hotel. Ticket cost was 750 rupees ($13.50) for foreigners compared to 20 rupees (.35c) for Indians. We used their battery powered shuttle to get to the East Gate, which was free.

The Taj Mahal is regarded as one of the eight wonders of the world, and some historians have noted that its architectural beauty has never been surpassed. It's built entirely of white marble and it's stunning, serene beauty is beyond adequate description, particularly at dawn and sunset. It was constructed over a period of twenty-two years, employing twenty thousand workers, and was completed in 1648.

I have always wanted to see the Taj Mahal, ever since learning about it in school, more years ago than I care to remember. I felt goosebumps on my skin as I stood there and feasted my eyes on this beautiful monument. It was a special moment for me, and one I've waited a long time for.

After leaving the Taj Mahal, pausing at the exit gate for one last look, I decided to walk back to
Inside Agra Fort
the hotel via The Oberoi Villas, a huge resort complex I had to walk past to return to my hotel. This place was beautiful, hidden behind it's high walls and manicured gardens. I walked through the enormous foyer, feeling very out of place in my crumbled clothes and floppy hat, and into the bar where I asked for a drink's menu. I ordered a coke and a tall glass of ice which I enjoyed, with free nibbles, sitting in their outdoor area with a fabulous view of the domes of the Taj Mahal and the setting sun. The coke wasn't expensive at 180 rupees ($3.25) but was six times what I would pay on the street. Thanks Lin, for suggesting I go there for a drink....it was very, very nice!

I decided to skip dinner with the rest of the group that night. I was tired, the heat saps any energy I have and going out for a late meal didn't appeal. I had bought fruit from a street stand earlier in the day and decided that I would eat that instead.

Even something as simple as buying fruit here is a hit and miss affair. There is

no refrigeration on street stands, so I have no idea how long it has been sitting in the sun. Some has been okay and some hasn't. All I can find are mandarins, oranges, bananas, mangoes, green grapes and lemons. There are no air conditioned shopping malls or supermarkets here, nothing remotely like them. I think I will enjoy my first supermarket trip when I return home..... so many options! Most days I crave for something really cold, and usually settle for Coke.

I only have one more day in Agra, and expect the temperature to hit 44 degrees again. It's just too hot to be out in the middle of the day. Several tour members have been affected by the heat and I have been experiencing light headedness myself, which I can only put down to the heat, otherwise I'm okay. I take it as a warning, up the water intake and stay inside during the hottest part of the day.
Around 9.30am, I grabbed a tuk tuk from the end of the street, wanting to go to the bazaars to pass some time. The driver took me to a shop (his friends), and suggested I might like

to shop there instead. Go inside and have a look, he said, then he would take me where I wanted to go. It was easier not to argue and would only take a couple of minutes, so I did as he asked. Two minutes later I was back in the tuk tuk, empty handed, and we set off again. The driver asked if I would like to go to a textile shop! What don't they get? I said no, I'm not buying textiles! Eventually I got to the bazaars to find only a few shops had opened and the rest would follow by 11.00am, exactly when I don't want to be out because of the heat!

I had a quick look around and then headed back to the hotel. I also visited Shilpgram, which was advertised as a handicraft and artwork market with food stalls and a bar. It was just around the corner from the hotel, in the complex where we bought our Taj Mahal tickets. It was a huge disappointment, as it turned out to be a motley collection of half a dozen stands all selling identical souvenir rubbish. The stall holders all clamoured at me to

The classic photo!
buy and followed me around, pushing their products in my face, and giving me their 'best price'. I left there feeling cranky, over the heat and the pressure to buy rubbish I don't want.

I returned to the hotel and stayed in for the remainder of the day. Tonight we're meeting on the rooftop for dinner before heading to the railway station for an overnight train to Varanasi.

Camels strutting by...
I spend the morning on a tour from a tuk-tuk driver. He said his name was Bobbie, but I highly doubt that. We went to Agra Fort where I’m sure had I paid an insane amount of money for a guide I would have been rewarded with endless details about it’s existence. But I actually wanted the abbreviated tour—it was 10am and I was boiling in the heat. Over a hundred and humid…*shudder. The fort was a military structure—built by the Mughals, important fun fact, Mughals are not Indians! I don’t exactly know what a Mughal is, but Bobbie stressed this to me several times so it must be important to them. Maybe equivalent to the Jam is not Jelly debate. Anyways, it was made by the grandfather to the man who ordered the construction of the Taj, Shah Jahan. Later on Jahan jazzed up the dated interior by adding his favorite building material, white marble (what the Taj is made out of) and converted it to a palace. Then years later, turn of events, Shah Jahan’s son takes over and imprisons him within the fort where he can has to gaze at the Taj that entombs his beloved (third) wife
That's the view from the Tuk-tuk
for the last several years of his life. Depressing. My self-guided tour starts out badly, there is somewhat of a faux entrance and a lot of confusion of where to buy a ticket—and with military armed guards everywhere I certainly don’t want them to think I’m sneaking in! I later find out this faux entrance was made to confuse attackers…well done Mughals. Well done. Most of the fort is actually blocked off—the good parts. Apparently there is a very elaborate underground system—one place where the original builder kept his harem—500 women! Meow. From there Bobbie takes me to the Itimad-ud-Daulah, affectionately known as the ‘Baby Taj.’ Here lies the grandfather to the woman who the Taj was built for. He was important to Shah Jahan for a reason lost to me. If only I had paid for another “official guide.” It was very beautiful, but I only stayed for about 20 minutes because the heat is unbearable. Next, Bobbie takes me to the post office as I requested which was an interesting experience—you wouldn’t think so, but I guess I lucked on this one. Bobbie points me to an entrance, I walk in and it is a very confusing mass of people—not patrons but workers. There are about 50 workers sorting mail on one end and a few official desks on the other end and people walking around with bags of what I presume to be mail. I slowly walk in with my envelope held firmly in front of me as if to say, “I come in peace” but no one pays much attention. Finally I approach a desk and the man looks up and I point to the corner and say, “stamp?” and he just points me to another door—not the one I came in…So I proceed through that door which leads me through a corridor of offices and finally lets me out into a room where I see all the counters to buy stamps/mail things, only…I am behind the counters?! Again I proceed slowly with my envelope presented in front of me and a man just says, “go to her, she stamp you.” What?! So, this is okay? Imagine walking in the backdoor of your post office, through the mail sorting room, past offices, and then up behind a postal worker and having about 50 people in lines watch you do this…doesn’t seem right does it? So I approach this woman and she doesn't seem surprised at all. I show her what I need and she tells me to take a seat…at the empty desk next to her? Looks like my line is open for business! At this point 2 men approach ‘my counter’ and are pointing at things they want, like a stapler or envelopes. Awkward! I try to politely ignore but then I’m treated as the bad guy! Finally the woman gives me my stamps and I’m out of there! Done working for the Indian postal service. Lastly, Bobbie takes me to a garden to view the backside of the Taj. I snap two pictures and ask to go home—which of course he objects to. He wants to then take me to “the best jewelry maker in Agra—beautiful silver!” I decline because the heat has taken it’s toll and I need a nap (after all, I’ve been up since 3am). He argues with me (if he takes me somewhere and I buy something, he will get a commission) and I sternly say, “Bobbie. I want to go home.” He jabbers at me for most of the way home—which of course I can’t hear because it’s drowned out by all the vehicles careening by us—tuk tuks have open sides so they are quite noisy. I finally get back to my room and collapse on the bed. It’s about 1:30 and my train leaves that evening at 8:30 back to Delhi where I will take a Taxi to the airport to meet some Polish traveling companions who are also going to the yoga school in Dharamsala. I feel drained from the day’s activities and just want to sleep but food needs to be acquired and my backpack won’t pack itself! A vicious cycle for backpackers, the backpack packing—it never goes in the way it came out. But happy to be done with Agra and on my way to greener pastures.

The Taj and the sunrise
Due to my sleep schedule I’m wide awake at 3am. Not ideal, but it did come in handy since I wanted to go see the sunrise at the Taj Mahal this morning. I get myself together and exit my room to find that they’ve locked the front doors to the hotel—which hey…safety first right? There’s a young guy sleeping in a cot next to the door and I decide to leave him be for a few minutes and see if I can catch a glimpse of the Taj and sunrise from the rooftop. Most of the hotels and restaurants in Agra advertise their views of the Taj, I don’t care that much but thought it’d be a different site. So I make my way up there cautiously because they have signs saying to beware of the monkeys on the roof. Surely there can’t really be monkeys on the rooftop?! Oh yes there can be. I walked up to find a large baboon (?) sitting on a ledge, a fairly safe distance from me. I felt confident enough to where I took my camera out and took a picture. Then I turn around and indeed there’s the tip top of the Taj
The Taj and I
and some lovely colors. So I line up to take a picture and then I hear it…the pitter patter of a monkey gallop. “Oh shit” I think to myself…how will I explain to my husband that I let a monkey attack me…I turn around—but at that moment think to myself, ‘do I want to see the monkey attack or just let it bite my bum and be off?’ So I give a half turn and see that it is actually running across the roof top to another roof and on his way. Phew. A quick look around and I spot about 20 monkeys all waking up from their slumber and ready to get their day started—which for all I know starts with breakfast on the rooftop, so I get the hell out of there! I begrudgingly wake up the sleeping “guard” and make my way down the street to one of the Taj entrances. Lines are non-existent and that makes me feel good about my early morning choice. I buy my ticket; fend off a very persistent tour guide—he came down from 975 rupees to 300! Still not interested. And then in the security check they tell me I can’t
A view from the garden
take my tripod in?! It’s a gorilla tripod, nothing pointy about it, and it’s about 7 inches long. Apparently they don’t allow tripods…great. This means I have to walk to the lockers to have it held for my trip. It would have been faster to go back to my hotel but I couldn't wake up the “guard” again. Minor set back…Finally back in the Taj grounds I one of a few hundred (better than thousand) and meander the grounds for a while. It is quite nice, must say Ol’ Shah Jahan really outdid himself. With the sun rising, the marble shimmers in ways that makes you want to just sit there and contemplate the love and devotion that went into erecting this tomb of adoration. As time ticks by you can feel the temperature rising and that’s when I know I’ve had enough. Back to the hotel for breakfast and a quick snooze, then to continue the day…

I’ve never felt so good leaving a city…I’m sure there is a lot of charm there but I sure didn’t get to see it. The train station left a lot to be desired and it was packed! Looks like I’m not the only one looking to skip town. They have metal detectors to walk through and you have to put your bags through an x-ray machine—but I don’t know why. The 3 men ahead of me all beeped as they walked through and no one was watching the x-ray machine?! I just took it as a hoop to jump through and prayed that no one had ill-fated plans for the Jhellum Express train to Agra that morning! After finding my train car (not as easy as it was made to sound) I bumbled my way through the narrow corridor and plopped in my seat—more praying, this time hoping I was A. in the right seat and B. on the right train. I had visions of being yelled at in Hindi about being in the wrong seat or wrong train. We finally start moving and I watched the train station platform turn into dilapidated homes, crumbling with age. Then you pass by miles and miles and miles of tent cities or garbage cities. It’s an incredible site. I’ve seen poverty in most of the places I’ve gone but this is heart wrenching. Slum dog Millionaire doesn’t do it justice—and I’m sure I didn’t see the worst of it. Makes me remember even on my worst days…it’s not that bad.

Once out of Delhi proper the haze starts to fade and I start to see blue skies, what a beautiful site. The garbage cities give way to fields of grains and even greenery. All the while there’s a man walking the corridor every few minutes yelling, “CHI-EEEE” I pass because well…I’m not that adventurous. But it’s at this moment I finally start to feel okay about my India adventure. The gentleman across from me gives me a few of his crackers—he informed me that he was out partying last night and is now hungry. He looks to be about 35 and has quite the belly on him. An interesting departure from the slender physique most Indian men seem to have here. A few hours later, we arrive in Agra. How do I know this? Three train personnel told me so—can’t help but feel they wanted to make sure the poor white girl got off when she was supposed to. A quick rip off by the tuk tuk driver and I’m cruising the streets with the cows and camels. He more or less takes me to my hotel—rips me off again, keep in mind he is pocketing an extra 50 rupees at the start of the trip and then squeezes an extra 10 out of me at the end. All in all that’s a dollar…so I can’t be too enraged. I make it to my room and collapse from the exhaustion.

I pulled myself together for a quick walk about but damn…it’s hot. Hotter than Delhi, rang in at 108. I make the rounds of the Taj Mahal entrances and get a game plan together for the following day. Head back to the room and end up falling asleep in my room till 10:00pm, which means I’ve missed another meal dammit. Oh well, that’s what my supply of Lara Bars are for...just happy to have blue skies and streets to walk down where I feel ‘safe.’

After being met from the train from Varanasi to Allahabad by a TLM driver we spent the night at the TLM Guesthouse over the road from the hospital. The food during our stay was the best we have eaten since we have been here.

On the morning of Monday the 22nd of April Andrew and I were shown around the inspiring Naini hospital. The hospital works with both leprosy patients and non-leprosy patients in order to decrease the stigma of the disease. The bellow covers just one aspect of the amazing work being done at Naini Hospital. Please see further entries for more on the CALL (Challenge Anti Leprosy Legislation) Campaign and the work being done by outreach social worker programs in the community.

We also want to say that it was wonderful to meet Becky Hodge (a friend of my friend Louisa's from Bristol University) who is working in the Hospital for her placement. We had a great time with Becky at dinner and lunch and she gave us a great insight into working in the hospital and was a homely comfort following our Varanasi expedition!

Self-Stigma

One of the biggest issues facing the mental treatment of persons affected by leprosy is self-stigma. Sufferers believe that they have been punished for something that they have done and deserve the disease that has been given to them. Further, these people have often been deserted by the ones they love and left in a hospital pending treatment. We met one man whose brother had left him at Naini Hospital saying he would come back when he was treated. The brothers came from a wealthy family who could more than have taken care of him and paid for his treatment. The brother never returned. You could see the sadness on the man's face when the hospital counsellor asked if he had heard from him yet. The Counsellor had rang his brother in an attempt to persuade him to come back and take care of him but he merely rep

Amelia has told you about the huge range of procedures that they do at the TLM Naini Community Hospital, so I, as your de facto medical correspondent will give a little introduction about the hand and foot de-clawing operations they do here and at Nand Nagri. Basically there are 3 nerves running up the forearm connecting the fingers to the brain. The radial, median and ulnar, and the quantity of bacteria infecting each one is directly proportional to the amount of clawing in each of the corresponding fingers that nerve controls. The nerve damage caused by the bacteria, like all nerve damage, is virtually impossible to repair.

So in order to correct the clawing, a tendon is brought around from the other side of the hand to add some more tension in order to straighten the fingers, whilst shortening the A2 flexor tendon in the fingers to align the fingertips to then new hand position. A similar procedure is performed on the thumb around 2 months later. All this is whilst the patients are in the first stages of the MDT treatment as it is very important to allow the patients to regain the functional use of their hands and rid themselves of the physical stigma as early as possible. Also it take time to adjust to the change in hand control. So to clench a fist, the muscles previously used to arch the hand backwards are required and vice versa.

The eyelids are another important area to work on, as the bacteria like to live in the cooler conditions there and the local nerve damage will stop the infected person from blinking. This results in cataracts, eye infections, and in one elderly chap we met, some of the worst corneal scarring that I've ever seen causing blindness. To correct this, a truly ingenious method was devised. A length of tendon is taken from the thigh, and connected from the jawbone tensor to the corner of the eye. So to blink, the patient has to clench his/her jaw and the eye closes. It's not perfect, but it's pretty close.

I must add that, all day going around the hospital, for a good 7 hours I was constantly moments from bursting out crying, but only a few hot tears were shed an quickly wiped away. Either from the unbelievably sad stories of the patients, the sheer hopelessness we found, or for sheer joy at some success story that we found. I am still an emotional wreck as a result of the overwhelmingly good work that TLM are doing out here.

I'm welling up again.

I know Amelia has written of our time in Varanasi, but I would like to make a short addition to it. People often talk of God speaking to them and signs from Him, and I can now add myself to the ranks of these people. It should have occurred to me with everything that had conspired to stop us reaching our destination, that something in the universe didn't want us to get there. How I wish I had listened. Varanasi was entirely miserable experience from start to finish.

The squalor, the utter and complete filth, and the blinding stupidity of the layout of the place did not sit well with me. Angry and belligerent cows have control of the streets, which despite being only 5 feet wide, morons on motorcycles still ride down. More than once I had to control an urge to pull one off his idiotic contraption and slap some sense into him.

However it was the quantity and variety of excrement in each and every street and walkway that I took deep and serious issue with. Cow, dog, monkey, and human faeces cover the streets of this “Holy City”, punctuated by the occasional man urinating in the street. The rain had turned the entire town into a vile, fetid, stinking swamp. Upon arrival I felt like the Monty Python definition of a king, the only one who hasn't got s*** all over him, but after venturing 20m out of the hotel door, this changes and I too am reduced back to the peasantry.

Not being a skilled wordsmith, I cannot summon quite enough vitriol and bitter resentment for the city of lights, but you get the picture. I am currently sitting aboard the Shiv Ganga Express leaving Varanasi, never to revisit. Upon my death I don't want to be burnt by the Ganges, but I do want the city by the Ganges to be burnt.

Apart from all that it was OK.

Delhi to Varanasi


Aboard the night train to Varanasi
Aboard the night train to Varanasi
19/04/2013

Our train from Delhi to Varanasi was meant to arrive at 11 am however as the train was five hours delayed leaving Delhi it was given low priority which meant every train behind us we had to let past. Our train therefore took an ironically ungodly 16 hours to reach Varanasi.

The train itself, once we were finally aboard was quite pleasant. We were in class AC2 with the majority of people being tablet and mobile wielding Indians. It was only when the train finally left the station that we began to relax. We met a friendly man who used to work for a Irish cafe who was keen to know where we were going and to tell us where we should be going. Andrew and I slept soundly in our bunks despite the train constantly stopping.

Unfortunately when we awoke in the morning we were many miles from Varnasi in the Indian countryside. We whiled away the journey watching House on the Netbook (thank you Smelly and Cat!) and catching up on our diary entries.

When we did arrive in Varanasi it was dark and we were at the Mugal Surai station some 40km from
Tuk-Tuk to the Ganges
Tuk-Tuk to the Ganges
Varanasi. After bartering for a fair price with a tuk-tuk driver we headed towards the Ghat. Our slightly crazy tuk -tuk driver had installed a strobe light in the back and enjoyed driving to extremely loud hindi music. He dropped us 'very near to Lalita Ghat' where our hotel was booked as tuk-tuks are not allowed down the narrow alley ways. We wandered down narrow alley ways constantly asking for directions but to no avail. We eventually bumped into a lovely American tourist who suggested we stay at her hostel. It being fully booked, we instead checked into the hotel next door being Shiva Guesthouse. It seemed clean and the owner gave me a cold bottle of water on arrival and showed me their stunning rooftop restaurant overlooking the Ganges. We paid the 700 Rs and headed off for a much needed shower and bed.

----

20/04/2013

For all those who constantly tell me that Andrew is grumpy in the morning - I can now give you proof that he can be a morning person when he wants to be for his girlfriend strongly requests him to be. At 5.10 am this morning our alarm went off
Sunrise over the Ganges
Sunrise over the Ganges
and we headed down at the crack of dawn for a boat ride down the Ganges. The reason I wanted to go to Varanasi was to see the Hindu religious ceremonies for the dead and the morning bathing rituals in the beautiful but very murky Ganges.

Unfortunately I seemed to have jinxed the weather by saying we would not see any rain until Australia. When we boarded the rowing boat with our newly made Japanese friend from the Hostel it was drizzling; by the time we turned around it was that sort of rain which drenches you to the bone. We rowed up and down the Ghats watching the men, women, children and holy men bathe and swim in the supposed healing waters. It was an amazing sight but altogether striking.

I had hoped to go by boost to the burning Ghat to see where the Hindus bring there dead for cremation but as the rain was coming down quite heavily and we rather worryingly began to feel cold, we instead headed back to the hostel.

We slept soundly for 3 boys before waking up to get to get breakfast. the hostel made us fresh pancakes which
Varanasi Boat Trip
we thought was a nice safe option although I did order a banana lassi which, although Andrew was unsure about was absolutely delicious.

After breakfast we headed out along the Ghats for what I can only describe as a bizarre experience caused by following the when in Rome principle to it's extreme. As we were walking we met two young boys who started taking to us about the history of the Ghats. The taller boy's English was fantastic so Andrew and I subtly agreed to give them some rupees if they showed us the way through the alleyways to the Golden Temple. Before we knew it we were winding through the streets with the awful racket of Justin Bieber being played loudly on their phone to amuse us. Under instruction we logged our passport details, left our bags in a locker and bought flowers to take into the temple. Andrew and I had a serious concern that we were in over our heads but didn't know how to proceed. We both realised we were definitely in over our heads when we were reciting marriage blessings to Shiva. Not wanting to be disrespectful we left as soon as we could.
The Ghats
The Ghats
The temple while beautiful seemed a way of forcing people into giving money for blessings which reminded me of the pre-Lutheran church.

The alleyways were so muddy and dirty that we were caked with mud. So in a real state of culture shock both at the abject poverty and the experience in the temple, we cleaned ourselves off, leaving the outside outside while we sat on our bed and watched Hugh Laurie do the doctoring he does best. The only interruption being the call of the monkeys, the fighting of feral dogs from nearby rooftops.

Baby Taj
Yesterday morning at about 06:00 I was awoken by the calls of the Chai wallah (man selling sweet tea) walking up and down the night train selling sweet smelling Chai. I peered out the window to see large red bastions which I presumed must be Agra Fort. The gentleman in the bed opposite told me that the train was not going to be stopping at Agra Cantonment despite it being on the schedule. This meant that not only did we have to deflate our pillows (Nanny & Grandad- we have used these every night bar the first two and they are brilliant!) and un-padlock our rucksacks at speed before being turfed off the train at the next station. We called our driver and let him know that we were instead at Agra Fort and he was with us in about five minutes. Mr Singh is a kind and friendly Sikh always running off to get us change or lending us change when water sellers are trying desperately hard to get us to overpay. We are travelling in a white Maruti Suzuki Swift with the most glorious AC.

Our first stop was to check into Rose Hotel the guesthouse we would
View of Taj Mahal from the Baby Taj
be staying in that night. The English speaking manager was much friendlier and helpful than the female lady at reception who nearly put me off the whole place altogether. The hotel itself was in a suburb of Agra and the room was clean even if the shower was again cold. We slept for three hours then met Mr Singh for a day trip round Agra.

First stop was Agra Fort. Built by Akbar this huge sandstone building was the stronghold of the Mughal empire for successive generations. As with most of the fortifications in India, Andrew and I have been stunned by the sheer scale of them. Windsor and Dover castle seemed dwarfs in comparison. The level of artwork that goes into the carving of the stone is simply stunning. It took us nearly 2 hours to walk round the huge complex, taking in the previous home of the infamous Peacock throne before it was moved to Delhi and then stolen.

Next we headed to the so-called “Baby Taj” or Itmad-ud-Daulah built by Akbar as atomb for Mirza Ghiyath Beg a Chief Wazir of Akbar's court. Designed by his daughter, the “Baby Taj” is a beautiful mausoleum of
Cows at the Taj - why not?
similar design to the Taj Mahal but with a pavilion instead of a domed roof. Again, the level of detail that went into every column was amazing.

We had a basic lunch and iced tea at a cafe chain we have beagan to recognise with the slogan “a lot can happen over coffee.” It didn't. Next stop the Taj Mahal!

To get to the Taj Mahal you have to take an electric shuttle bus up the road to the main gate. From there you walk though a red sandstone forecourt and the Taj arises from the archway. Described by the poet Rabdinranath Tagore as a “tear on the face of eternity” the Taj is a monument dedicated to Shah Jehan's love of his wife. Well, his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. I think the other wives must have been rather gutted to be honest. Mumtaz Mahal died whilst giving birth to her 14th child in 1631 which gives some cause for her husband to have loved her. The calligraphy that adorns the gateway, mosque and tombs is cleverly shaped so that although they are in fact increasing in size as they continue upwards, the give the effect that all
Tear drop on the face of eternity
the writing is the same size.

The Taj Mahal is all I had hoped it to be and more, the North to South canal was full of water contrary to what my Guidebook had foretold and the leafy gardens were a refreshing break from the 45 degree sun. I can easily say I have never seen a more beautiful building. Words don't do it justice. In the evening we went to watch the sunset from Mehtab Garden directly opposite the South side of the Taj. Unfortunately it wasn't a very clear night so it was difficult to see the Taj's changing colours but the view was still awe-inspiring. We headed back tired but very happy with all we had managed to see and do.

Taj Mahal at Sunrise
First reflecting pool and much jostling for key position
Whoever first uttered that nugget obviously never visited Bangkok in April. Sure, it's infernally humid but mix that with nearly 100 balmy degrees (F) and that has the makings of one hot city. I've been here a week and the last couple of days I've taken to staying in my air conditioned hotel room between roughly 11 am and 6 pm while catching up on the New England Patriots productive off season and the Celtics futility against the eminently beatable New York Knicks for which I was not about to wake up at 4:00 am local time to watch live on the internet. The rooftop pool is small comfort from the heat.

I haven't blogged since early December 2012 from Turkey. Since then I've been to Egypt for 2 weeks, Ethiopia for a month, Nairobi for a couple of days, and India for the most recent 3 months. Lost my motivation in Ethiopia which I did not like and India certainly did not help me regain the missing mojo. India is one of those places that almost everyone loves or hates. I was somewhere in the middle but most of it seemed kind of underwhelming and not worth the immense
Taj Mahal
amount of hassle that comprises a significant portion of the quintessential India experience. However, Egypt was great, second revolution notwithstanding (no impact on tourists back then), and that blog entry is forthcoming. I hope someday to post more pictures from India but for now the amazing Taj Mahal will have to suffice even though pictures do not really do it justice.

Everything is fine aside from the barely tolerable heat which should slightly diminish as I work my way south to one or two sea-breezy Thai islands then Penang, Malaysia on the way to Sumatra, Indonesia. It is like dejá vu all over again as the itinerary is vaguely similar to my 2006 trip to Southeast Asia. Unlike 2006, I'm mildly shocked and chagrined that there are still hoards of tourists during what is purportedly the start of the low season. I was also in Bangkok in April of 2006 and I don't remember it being anywhere near this crowded. Or expensive...

Best to everyone.

Go Celtics!

Sunrise in Delhi: 5am
Rooftop restaurant
After an early start (5am) we hopped into a car – bleary eyed - for the six hour round trip to Agra. Along the way we encountered various sites: cows, pigs and goats… that all apparently enjoy napping in the middle of the main roads. We also saw families on motorbikes (no helmets), mothers clinging on to their babies with one hand, clinging on to the driver with another. Seeing a baby’s tiny feet dangle off a motorcycle as oncoming trucks were beeping and blaring their way towards them... The first time we felt a tad sick. Yikes.

We also saw many open buses, completely overcrowded. People were even hanging off the back of the buses and clinging onto the roof tops – for dear life I should imagine. Needless to say, we felt a little guilty travelling by ‘car’.

After a sleepy journey we finally arrived safely in Agra and, well, what can I say… the Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen. You step outside and it quite literally takes your breath away. You need a moment or two to gather yourself together again, before you’re able to start walking towards
Taj Mahal
One of the wonders of the world
it. The photo’s won’t do it justice…. you’ve really got to see it to believe just how stunning it actually is.

So just a (very) little bit of background info: the Taj Mahal was built byMughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Mumtaz died during childbirth (child No.14!), Shah Jahan was grief-stricken. Jahan's grief illustrates the love story traditionally held as an inspiration for Taj Mahal… The

Emperor himself described the Taj in these words

‘Should guilty seek asylum here,
Like one pardoned, he becomes free from sin.
Should a sinner make his way to this mansion,
All his past sins are to be washed away.
The sight of this mansion creates sorrowing sighs;
And the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes.
In this world this edifice has been made;
To display thereby the creator's glory.’

It took 22 years to complete and with 22,000 men. The designs are so intricate and beautiful, the white marble of the building representing the ‘purity’ of his love…. We both agree, a once in a lifetime experience and definitely the most stunning man-made site

in the world.

We had a lot of people ‘not so sneakily’ taking pictures of us today. In fact, they came up to us quite confidently and asked to have their picture taken with us, but it did not stop with one… different family members ran up one by one to have their picture taken with us. We couldn’t believe that we were standing in front of the Taj Mahal and it was us they wanted pictures of :/ We also couldn’t get over the “you -beautiful” remarks, which clearly contradicts the actual state of us – red, sweaty, frizzy haired messes...

Yet of course for every (uncalled for) ‘beautiful’ remark we do have to have a little giggle at the men who refer to us as “healthy” looking … at the same time this is being said, they will gesture something that looks remarkably like a very “large” whale. We blame it on our clothes, which we have now started referring to as our ‘tent clothes’ (and nothing at all to do with the amount of curries and cottage cheese we are eating…) We were actually asked the other night if we were “sisters” because “we look…”

(gesture: very large whale) “healthy”.

We’re off to bed now, pretty shattered. Night night all. Thank you for reading, love to all. Onto Jaipur tomorrow….

Goa 1
Prachtige zonsondergang op het strand van Palolem in Goa.
In paradijselijk Goa hebben we ruim een week heerlijk vakantie gevierd en alle indrukken verwerkt van het eerste deel van onze India trip. Met haar Portugese invloeden en rustige ligging aan de Arabische Zee gaf deze deelstaat ons direct een heel ander gevoel dan de rest van India. Een prima plek om ons opnieuw op te laden en eens te lezen. Na een week hadden we het strand echter wel gezien en weer zin om op pad te gaan. Er is zoveel te doen, zien en beleven in dit kleurrijke land dat we geen tijd wilden verspillen. Het bleek echter niet zo gemakkelijk om Goa te verlaten. Inmiddels was de vakantieperiode aangebroken voor de Indiërs zelf met volgeboekte treinen tot gevolg. En dit was ons vooruitzicht voor de komende twee maanden! Na meerdere reisbureaus afgestruind te hebben op zoek naar een treinticket richting Varanasi gaven we het op en besloten we op de bonnefooi naar Mumbai te gaan om het daar op het treinstation zelf te proberen. Dit bleek een goede zet want hier kwamen we in aanraking met de zogenaamde “toerist quota”; speciaal gereserveerde treinkaarten voor buitenlandse toeristen die alleen op het treinstation te verkrijgen zijn en veel goedkoper dan

Verkoopsters op het strand van Palolem, Goa. Een rustige strandwandeling zat er de eerste dagen helaas niet in. Constant kwamen de vrouwen naar ons toe voor een vriendelijk praatje en ""oh ja, kom je even kijken in mijn winkel"". De eerste paar keer vonden we dit wel grappig, maar na een paar dagen hadden we er wel genoeg van. Gelukkig kenden ze ons op een gegeven moment en gaven ze het uiteindelijk op. De prachtige sari's die deze vrouwen droegen leverden wel mooie plaatjes op op het strand.
via een tussenpersoon. Klink als een scam? Klopt, maar het werkt echt! Met ons ticket voor Varanasi in de pocket hebben we ons de rest van de dag in Mumbai vermaakt. Om ons op te frissen en klaar te maken voor de lange treinrit hadden we een kamer geboekt in het “India Guesthouse”, voor degenen die het boek “Shantaram” hebben gelezen wel bekend.

En wat een treinrit stond ons te wachten! Dwars door het midden van India en in een overvolle “sleeper class” zonder airco hebben we voor het eerst echt kennis gemaakt met hoe het merendeel van de Indiërs reist. Het treinsysteem in India kent heel veel verschillende klassen in lijn met het kastenstelsel. Iets wat voor ons Nederlanders onbekend en bizar is. Als je veel geld hebt, boek je een eerste klas treinticket met alle comfort van dien. Het merendeel van de Indiërs reist echter voor het goedkopere “sleeper class” tarief. Ook als mensen geen kaartje hebben weten te bemachtigen en nog op de zogenaamde “waiting list” staan. Resultaat: overvolle treinen waarin je letterlijk op elkaar zit en dat in een enorme hitte gedurende lange ritten dwars door het land! Het mooie is dat Indiërs hier geen

probleem mee hebben. Zij zijn gewend om kleine ruimtes met elkaar te moeten delen en bleken een stuk toleranter dan de meeste toeristen die we tegenkwamen die vochten voor hun eigen plekje.

Nuchter als wij zijn, waren we al helemaal blij dat we sowieso een ticket hadden weten te bemachtigen en vonden we het bovendien onzin om veel meer te betalen dan nodig. En dat hebben we geweten! Door de herrie en het enorme zweten hadden we bijna geen oog dicht gedaan en kwamen we 52 uur later – met dus een tussenstop van 14 uur in Mumbai – helemaal kapot aan in Varanasi. Ondanks alles waren we blij dat we deze reis hadden meegemaakt, niet alleen om het “echte” India te ervaren, maar ook omdat we de meest boeiende gesprekken met locals hadden. Zo was er tijdens deze rit één jongen met wie we lang gesproken hebben en die op een gegeven moment zei, nadat we ons eten ophadden en het afval bewaarden om op een station weg te gooien: “you can throw it out of the window, no problem, you are in India, they will clean it up”. Dit is de houding van veel Indiërs en onder

andere hierdoor heeft het land zoveel problemen met afval . Want natuurlijk wordt het niet overal opgeruimd en zie je overal afval liggen in de natuur. Echt hart verscheurend om te zien hoe het merendeel van de Indiërs met de natuur omgaat. Toen wij antwoordden dat wij dat niet over ons hart konden verkrijgen en wilden wachten tot het volgende station naderde, zag je hem denken. In ieder geval hebben we tijdens deze rit één iemand bewust kunnen maken, want de rest van de treinrit gooide hij zelf ook steeds zijn afval weg op de stations.

Eenmaal in Varanasi aangekomen bleek dat we geen groter contrast hadden kunnen uitzoeken na het rustige Goa. Gelukkig hadden we ons hier mentaal al op voorbereid. Rickshaw drivers en taxi chauffeurs kwamen als vliegen op ons af en het hele systeem bleek zo corrupt als de pest. Zelfs de pre-paid rickshaws waren niet te vertrouwen volgens de man van de pre-paid taxi standplaats. Gelukkig waren we inmiddels bedreven in het hele spel en wisten we zelf een betrouwbare rickshaw te vinden die ons netjes naar ons hotel heeft gebracht. Ons hotel lag aan één van de ghats en dat bleek een goede keuze

te zijn. De ghats waren een oase van rust in vergelijking met de rest van Varanasi, waar de geur van (brandend) afval, urine en koeienvlaai overheerste. Naast de enorme chaos moesten we ook wennen aan de hitte met zo’n 45 graden. We hadden al snel door dat we onze activiteiten moesten beperken tot de ochtend en het einde van de dag, de rest van de dag was het veel te heet. Maar wat een kleurrijke, chaotische en magische stad! Niet alleen is Varanasi één van de oudste constant bewoonde steden ter wereld en de oudste in India, voor Hindoes en Jains is het de meest heilige stad van de zeven heilige steden. Zij geloven dat als ze in Varanasi sterven ze verlost worden, wat het tot een zeer belangrijk pelgrimsoord maakt. We hebben onze ogen uitgekeken en vonden het een heel bijzondere stad met alle activiteiten die plaatsvinden aan de Ganges. De Indiërs doen echt alles in het water: baden, scheren, kleding wassen, zwemmen, bidden, buffels wassen, lijken verbranden en ze drinken het zelfs: je kan het zo gek niet bedenken. En dat allemaal tussen het afval en de riolen door. In Varanasi alleen al komen 32 (!) riolen uit

op de Ganges. Geen wonder dat dit gedeelte van de Ganges 3000x meer vervuild is dan dat veilig is voor mensen om in te baden!

Varanasi is het beste te bewonderen door langs de verschillende ghats te wandelen en een boottocht te maken bij zonsopgang. Tijdens de wandelingen die we hebben gemaakt werd ons telkens de vraag gesteld: “yes please, wanna get high?” Een bijzonder contrast met de heilige rituelen die plaatsvonden aan de ghats. Elke ghat van de totaal 80 ghats heeft zijn eigen verhaal: zo zijn sommigen eigendom van een Maharadja (zij waren vroeger heersers over koninkrijken/staten binnen India)en zelfs moeder Theresa bezit een van de ghats. Vooral de zogenaamde “burning ghats” waar crematies publiekelijk worden uitgevoerd maken veel indruk op ons westerlingen. Dit komt met name omdat deze manier van cremeren zo ver afstaat van die van ons. Alles gebeurt in het openbaar en niets achter gesloten deuren zoals wij dat gewend zijn. Regelmatig zie je door de stad een groep mannen zingend door de straten lopen met een soort brancard waar een lijk op ligt onder een stapel kleurrijke lappen stof. Voordat de crematie start wordt het lijk onder gedompeld in de heilige Ganges. De

We hebben drie maanden mogen genieten van de heerlijke Indiase keuken met al haar geuren, kleuren en specerijen. Een van de gerechten waar we gek op waren was de ""dosa"". Hier hadden we ons in een restaurant laten omlullen om een keer een papieren dosa te bestellen. Zoals je ziet is deze echt enorm! Het is ons helaas niet gelukt om deze op te krijgen....
prijs van de crematie wordt bepaald door de houtsoort en de hoeveelheid hout die wordt gebruikt voor de verbranding. Bij de crematie is vaak een kleine groep mannen aanwezig, de vrouwen blijven thuis.

Om de chaos even te ontsnappen hebben we een dagtrip gemaakt naar het vredige Sarnath: de plek waar Boeddha zijn beroemde eerste “teachings” gaf over de middenweg naar nirvana, nadat hij zelf verlicht was geraakt in Bodhgaya. Echt een super vredige plek zo dichtbij het chaotische Varanasi! Het was voor ons ook de eerste keer dat we in aanraking kwamen met het boeddhisme in India. Het duurde even voordat we een rickshaw chauffeur hadden gevonden die ons voor een redelijke prijs daarheen wilde brengen, aangezien we hier voor het eerst in aanraking kwamen met prijsafspraken tussen chauffeurs. Iets waar je met name in de toeristische gebieden in India helaas tegenaan loopt. Na afloop trakteerde de chauffeur ons op een chai thee uit een aardewerken kopje dat we daarna kapot konden gooien op straat. Ook iets wat alle rickshaw chauffeurs bleken te doen in Varanasi en wat we niet eerder waren tegengekomen. Nu begrepen we waarom we ineens zoveel moesten betalen voor een ritje, maar leuk was

het wel!

Vanuit Varanasi hebben we de trein gepakt naar Bodhgaya, de plaats waar prins Siddhartha Gautama 2600 jaar geleden verlichting bereikte en onder een “bodhi” boom Boeddha werd. Hoewel de oorspronkelijke boom vernield is, staat een stek hiervan op de originele plek in de prachtige Mahabodhi tempel, die op de UNESCO Werelderfgoed lijst staat. Voor Boeddhisten is dit daarom een zeer belangrijke pelgrimsplaats. Toen wij er waren was het laagseizoen omdat het veel te heet was met zo’n 48 (!) graden. Hierdoor waren we een van de weinige toeristen en binnen een uur kenden wij het hele dorp en zij ons. Voor een paar dagen vonden we dat wel grappig! Vergeleken met het hindoeïsme en Varanasi in het bijzonder is het boeddhisme erg vredig en rustig en dat was ook het gevoel dat we direct kregen bij aankomst in Bodhgaya. Helemaal toen we onze bijzondere slaapplek hadden gevonden in de Tibetaanse Karma tempel, waar we ’s morgens hebben gemediteerd met de Tibetaanse monniken die daar in opleiding waren en hun “puja” (gebed) uitvoerden. Wat we toen nog niet wisten is dat de Tibetanen hun puja doen met veel instrumentale begeleiding. We schrokken ons rot toen ze de eerste

keer op hun trommels sloegen! Echt concentreren konden we ons daarna niet meer, maar een bijzondere ervaring was het zeker. In Bodhgaya staan veel tempels uit diverse landen met hun verschillende culturen en architectuur stijlen. Hierdoor kregen we in een dag een goede indruk van de verschillende stijlen, erg efficiënt ;-) Het slapen in de tempel was een bijzondere ervaring, maar bleek achteraf veel te heet. We hadden geen airco, alleen een fan, en we werden ’s nachts regelmatig wakker van de hitte en het zweten. De fan blies alleen maar hele hete lucht rond, waardoor het aanvoelde als een “opgieting” in een sauna. Na twee nachten vonden we het daarom wel mooi en tijd om af te reizen naar een koeler gedeelte van India: Darjeeling.

Vanwege onze ervaring met de vorige lange treinrit naar Varanasi en de hoge temperaturen besloten we onszelf een upgrade te geven in de treinklasse en voor “2AC” te gaan met airco. Na enorm lang hangen op het treinstation in Patna in verband met vertraging konden we eindelijk aan boord en hebben we die nacht voor het eerst heerlijk geslapen in de trein! 2AC it is! en vanaf die rit hebben we alleen nog

maar die klasse geboekt. ’s Morgens vroeg kwamen we aan op het treinstation in Siliguri van waaruit we een gedeelde jeep hebben gepakt naar Darjeeling. Tijdens deze rit maakten we kennis met een groep toeristen met wie we de dagen erna zijn opgetrokken. Een van hen was Mishana, een kiwi met wie we een paar dagen later de zesdaagse “Singalila Ridge”- trekking hebben gedaan op de grens van India en Nepal op zoek naar de Himalaya gebergten. Letterlijk op zoek want tijdens de trekking hebben we helaas niets kunnen zien van de machtige sneeuwtoppen! Door weer en wind (zeer dichte mist, regen, hagel, kou en onweersbuien) hebben we ons zes dagen lang gedurende 92 km met veel klimmen en dalen geworsteld van hut naar hut onder begeleiding van een gids die ons steeds aanmoedigde als het huilen ons nader stond dan het lachen: “you can do it mem, no problem, we are nearly there”. “Nearly there” betekent in India nog een takken stuk lopen 😉. Het enige dat we konden zien gedurende deze dagen waren de prachtige rododendrons en magnolia’s die in bloei stonden en de yaks die we onderweg tegenkwamen. Des te meer konden we ’s avonds genieten van
Sarnath 1
Dit is de plaats waar Gautama Boeddha voor het eerst zijn ""dharma"" onderwees aan vijf leerlingen, vijf weken nadat hij verlicht was geraakt in Bodhgaya. Hier staat tevens een van de ""bodhi"" bomen.
de kleine dingen: een warme kachel, een lekkere maaltijd en een welverdiend biertje. Elke ochtend weer hoopten we op heldere luchten maar het mocht niet zo zijn.

Voor en na de trekking hebben we een tijd doorgebracht in Darjeeling waar het heerlijk cool was in vergelijking met het midden van India. En we waren erg blij om weer midden in de natuur te zijn! Zoveel groen om ons heen hadden we voor het laatst in Australië gehad. Naast een bezoek aan de “Happy Valley” thee plantage hebben we onder andere een bezoek gebracht aan een “Tibetan refuge centre”, waar we voor het eerst in aanraking kwamen met Tibetaanse vluchtelingen. Vanuit Darjeeling hebben we ook een trip gemaakt naar het prachtige en groene Sikkim met als hoogtepunt het Tibetaanse Rumtek klooster in Gangtok. Het Rumtek klooster is het hoofdverblijf van de gevluchte 17e karmapa die op dit moment in Dharamsala leeft. Een grote troon staat in de tempel in afwachting van zijn komst. Of de Indiase regering hem zal toelaten hier betwijfelen we gezien de gespannen situatie met China wat dit betreft. We hadden ons bezoek precies goed gepland, want we konden hier een gebed meemaken van de vele monniken

die daar wonen, wat erg bijzonder was.

Vanaf Pelling in Sikkim hebben we een vierdaagse reis ondernomen om in Shimla te komen, hét vakantieoord van de rijkere Indiërs. We dachten: als de Himalaya zichzelf niet wil laten zien aan ons in het oosten dan gaan we toch gewoon naar het westen? Helaas tevergeefs voor de witte sneeuwtoppen, maar we hebben wel onze ogen uitgekeken hoe de Indiërs vakantie vieren. Shimla is echt zien en gezien worden! Vanaf Kalka zijn we het laatste gedeelte van de reis met een stroomtreintje naar boven naar Shimla gegaan. Een prachtige rit door bossen in de bergen! Geen wonder dat deze 92 km rails en 102 tunnels op de UNESCO Werelderfgoed lijst staan.

En hoe konden we onze drie maanden in India mooier afsluiten dan in McLeod Ganj – een dorpje net boven Dharamsala – om een vierdaagse lezing bij te wonen van His Holiness de Dalai Lama? Dit was een droom van Floor en hierop hadden we aan het begin van onze India trip ons reisschema afgesteld. Vandaar de ietwat bijzondere route die we hebben genomen, kriskras door het land 😉 Ook was dit de plek voor onze reünie met Barbara en

Rene, een Nederlands stel dat we ontmoet hadden in Australië. Erg bijzonder en leuk om elkaar in een hele andere omgeving weer te zien! Voor Barbara en Rene betekende deze 1,5 week die we samen hadden het einde van hun wereldreis. Voor ons niet, maar wij waren door de vele indrukken die we hadden opgedaan even klaar met van alles doen en bekijken en konden prima meekomen in de stroom van vakantie vieren. De dagen vlogen voorbij met biertjes drinken op ons balkon, “Uno” spelen, lekker eten, lezen, shoppen (Barbara en Floor dan….) en last but not least de lezingen van de Dalai Lama bijwonen en meer leren over de situatie van Tibetaanse vluchtelingen. De lezing vond plaats in het Tibetaans met helaas een niet zo’n beste Engelse vertaler ertussen, waardoor sommige informatie verloren ging. Desalniettemin was het heel bijzonder om mee te maken en de Dalai Lama van zo dichtbij te kunnen zien. Een zeer bijzondere man met altijd een glimlach op zijn gezicht en nog zo’n jongensachtige uitstraling op 77-jarige leeftijd! De lezing ging over “Shantideva's A Guide to the Boddhisattva's Way of Life”. Erg interessant, maar zelfs met het boek in onze handen leverde het meer vragen

dan antwoorden op. Dat zal er wel bij horen, de weg naar Verlichting is natuurlijk niet eenvoudig 😉

Niet alleen woont de veertiende Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso sinds zijn vlucht in 1959 in McLeod Ganj, maar ook de Tibetaanse regering, het parlement in ballingschap en veel overige Tibetaanse vluchtelingen. Het dorp voelt hierdoor meer aan als Tibetaans dan Indiaas en het bood ons daarom een goede mogelijkheid om meer te weten te komen over de situatie van Tibet. Tijdens een informatieavond realiseren we ons hoe weinig we eigenlijk weten over Tibet, behalve dan dat China het onderdrukt en dat Tibet met name in 2008 tijdens de Olympische Spelen kans zag om dit kenbaar te maken aan de wereld. Hoe meer we er meer over lezen, horen en zien, hoe meer sympathie we hebben voor Tibetanen en des te bizarder de situatie op ons overkomt. Als het doorgaat zoals nu het geval is zal de hele Tibetaanse cultuur op den duur verdwijnen. Heel erg zonde voor zo’n mooie en vredelievende beschaving. Barbara en Rene zijn tijdens deze reis een week in Tibet geweest en van hen horen we onder andere hoe de Chinezen er alles aan doen om controle te

houden en de Tibetaanse cultuur en religie uit te roeien. Foto’s en teksten van de Dalai Lama zijn uit den boze en zie je daar nergens terug, overal staan Chinese checkposten om Tibetanen te controleren, onder andere dat ze zichzelf niet in brand steken wat nog regelmatig gebeurt. De Chinezen hebben zelfs een Chinese Pänchen Lama benoemd (hoogste spirituele leider na de Dalai Lama, heeft als belangrijke taak om nieuwe Dalai Lama te herkennen), nadat de door de Tibetaanse regering in ballingschap aangewezen Pänchen Lama sinds 1995 verdwenen is. Het gaat zelfs zover dat de Chinese regering door middel van censuur de Tibetanen afschildert als “Peaceful Terrorists” richting haar eigen volk. Het is ons (nog) niet helemaal duidelijk hoe de Verenigde Naties hierin staan, maar verontrustend is de situatie wel.

Vanwege de sympathie die we voelen voor Tibetanen en de wens om tijdens deze reis vrijwilligerswerk te doen besloten we om een aantal dagen een Tibetaanse vluchtelingenorganisatie te helpen. Koos door hen te helpen met hun website en Floor door Engelse conversatieklas met Tibetaanse vluchtelingen. Veel Tibetanen spreken alleen maar Tibetaans als ze in McLeod Ganj aankomen. Door Engels te leren kunnen ze contact maken met de rest van
Varanasi 7
Dasaswamedh Ghat
de wereld. Hoewel de Tibetanen zelf aangaven dat de conversatieklassen hen helpen, waren wij niet zo heel erg onder de indruk van het management van de organisatie en besloten het na een paar dagen voor gezien te houden. Wellicht dat we ons later tijdens onze reis nog ergens nuttig kunnen maken, India blijkt ons te veel te hebben opgeslokt!

We sluiten onze trip door India af in Delhi, daar waar het drie maanden geleden begon. Dit keer bereiken we gelukkig wel goed ons hotel zonder verwikkeld te raken in een scam 😉 Hoewel Delhi veel te bieden heeft vinden we het veel te heet en zitten we te vol met indrukken van de afgelopen tijd om nog veel te willen zien. We genieten van de laatste dag met Barbara en Rene in een zwembad midden in Delhi en besluiten dat we als we in Thailand aankomen eerst twee weken naar het strand gaan om alle indrukken van India te verwerken voordat we onze reis voortzetten naar het volgende fascinerende land: Birma!

Niet eerder zijn we in een land geweest dat we zo bizar en fascinerend vonden, waar het contrast tussen arm & rijk zo groot is door het
Varanasi 8
Dasaswamedh Ghat
kastensysteem, waar de zintuigen zo worden geprikkeld van de geurigste curries tot de meest kleurrijke sari’s, waar er zoveel gevarieerdheid is van heilige plaatsen, chaotische ranzige steden, rustige dorpjes, moderne stranden tot machtige bergtoppen. Het gevoel van “wat doen we hier” dat we in het begin van onze reis hadden heeft definitief plaats gemaakt voor een enorme fascinatie. Na drie maanden zijn we klaar om te vertrekken, maar we hebben ondanks de uitdagingen enorm genoten en hopen hier zeker ooit nog eens terug te keren voor een vakantie. We stappen met een voldaan gevoel op het vliegtuig richting Bangkok en laten deze bizarre, intrigerende wereld achter ons.

Next stop: Thailand & Birma!

On the banks of the Ganges in the holy city of Varanasi they burn the dead bodies of the believers. Hindus believe that dying in Varanasi and being burned on the banks of the sacred river will allow your soul to exit the constant cycle of reincarnation. Your exit from the cycle of death and rebirth is known as moksha and it is the desire of the faithful to end this continuous cycle and achieve ultimate salvation. Why is it that many people around the world want to live forever, but virtually all Hindus want to exit this continual cycle of infinite lives? Our world is full of irony. Ironically this sacred ritual has become a grotesque tourist attraction that draws thousands if not millions each year since the dawn of tourism.

Those who bath in the Ganges are absolved of their bad deeds and are washed clean. So they come here in droves to bath and to die. In this holy city you find it all, the good, the bad, the ugly. Every emotion is felt here in the extreme, the highest highsand the lowest lows. Varanasi is a true test of the feelings of empathy and sympathy with
IMAG0502
the dead and dying all around you.

Throughout the day bodies covered in orange silks and garlands of orange flowers are carried above the heads of friends and family members through the small windy roads from the main streets to the burning ghat near the river. Before visiting I had imagined that the entire riverside from one of the city to the next would be one burning ghat after another, but in actuality there are just two main places where they burn bodies and one is much more active than the other with fires raging constantly day and night. I cannot imagine how many forests have been felled in order to fan the giant fires of the ghats of Varanasi.

For several days I took in all of the varied emotions of Varanasi before finally making the 130km journey to the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad. The Kumbh Mela in one word is intense. Intense noises, intense emotions, intense weather, intense people. This floodplain of the Ganges is a land where synchronicities and ironies abound. Millions upon millions journey here to wash in the Ganges to be absolved of all of their sins. Also heaps and heaps of vendors
IMG_0778
and beggars come to the Kumbh Mela to gain something for themselves. I was going because of my never-ending curiosity to understand. I wanted to see this extreme gathering for all that is was and I figured maybe, just maybe I might just bath with the faithful. Most of all I was interested in learning more about the naked ascetics, to see where so many people shit and to watch millions of people bath at one time.

The three hour bus from Varanasi left me on the standing on the side of the road. The bus had just crossed a long bridge with the Mela spreading out of both sides as far as I could see in the hazy setting sun. The gathering was being held in February and March because it was the only time when the river bed would be dry allowing enough space for the millions of visitors. I had the address of several camps in my notebook but I figured I would try to first find the Rainbow Camp, which I had learned was at the end of Tulsi Road in Sector 7. It was a long walk especially with a big backpack, luckily a
IMG_0762
nice guy stopped as I was crossing one of the long pontoon bridges and asked if I needed a ride. We drove down the metal plate roads for what seemed like forever until the road ended. The camp was another 10 minute walk through lots of dirt and sand out to the very edge of the Mela. I met all sorts of amazing people from around the world at the Rainbow Camp, many of whom had come to India to go to the Mela.

From the Rainbow Camp it seemed like the Mela was just a strange dream and it looked like an enormous parking lot of electrical poles and orange flood lights. Virtually every camp in the Mela had a loudspeaker system and were blaring some mantra or song, usually it was Hare Krishna on repeat and it hurt the ears to pass in front of some of the camps. Standing out in the Rainbow Camp you could hear all of the noise blending together to form a hum that lasted all day and all night. Most camps also had lots of flashing lights to go with their noise. Some of these were really extravagant affairs with flashing
IMG_0783
peacocks and Om symbols. The entire Mela was a virtual feast for the senses and I had a lot to learn.

I found that I could only take the intensity of the Mela in short doses, the rest of the time I dearly enjoy the solitude and quietness of the Rainbow Camp. The Rainbow Camp was a peaceful paradise in a world of chaos and noise. After a few days someone discovered that if you walked 10 minutes to the right of camp you would come upon a clean tributary that was secluded and perfect for swimming. Daily we would walk over to the swimming hole to swim and relax and completely forget about the Mela. It was a oasis compared to the dry dusty camp and it was our secret.

Before my pilgrimage to the Kumbh Mela I watched a very thought provoking documentary called Kumare. Released in 2012 Kumare is about an American guy of Indian descent that fakes being a guru to see how many people will follow him. At the end he reveals his true self to the followers and tells them that they should follow their inner guru within themselves. After watching the
IMG_0785
film, just before leaving for the Mela, I read an article by the author Erik Davis with his take on the film and if it matters if a guru is real or not. Together the film and the article played a large part in my thinking during the whole Kumbh Mela as I met and saw countless gurus and babas. Please watch Kumare and/or read: http://www.aeonmagazine.com/oceanic-feeling/erik-davis-guru-trickster/

It is impossible for me to try to differentiate between a baba, a guru, and a sadhu, they are all considered holy men in Hinduism. Let’s just say that after meeting countless babas at the Kumbh Mela I have become completely fascinated by them and conducted an impromptu study on them. I believe it’s possible to write an entire book solely about babas and their strange practices. Here I’ll just keep it short and say that the term baba comes from the word in Hindi for father. Baba is also used to give respect, sometimes people in India called me baba. There are many types of babas, all of whom have supposedly renounced the normal world to go on their strange path. Many babas walk around naked or with a small loincloth and
mini-IMG_0888
most have dreadlocks. Some babas no longer go around naked and you would never know they had once lived naked. Some babas only go naked at the Kumbh Mela.

One of the most fascinating of the babas are the naga babas. Naga babas go around naked covered in ash with long dreadlocks (except for the new initiates that just shaved their heads). Some of the naga babas do strange tricks with their penises, such as wrapping it up around a sword and then having another baba stand on it to the applause of the onlookers. Or maybe they will hold up their arm for 10 years with the help of a post. Eventually their arm will shrivel and become useless. This is done as a sign of devotion to whichever god they have chosen. I heard of one guy that held his hand in a fist for so long that his fingernails grew through his hand.

Babas that are devotees of Shiva sit around all day with an ever-changing cast of characters drinking heavily sugared tea with milk and never quit smoking their chillum of charass and tobacco. They believe that smoking charass lifts the veil of illusion
mini-IMG_0896
and shows another way of viewing the world.

Even though most of the babas I met seemed to just be interested in getting stoned and finding Western initiates, I was very captivated by their ways and wondered how this strange culture had developed. I found it extremely ironic that these men who had supposedly renounced everything had become addicted to three of the most important colonial era products: tea, sugar, and tobacco.

Most of the naga babas were located in Sector 4 in the center of the Mela. There were hundreds of baba camps, each with long avenues of babas sitting behind fires with their tents and living spaces behind them. Most people who visited the Mela came with the intent to see this mystifying assortment of babas. It was a very strange place to walk through with virtually every baba waving you over to sit with them. I spoke with several Westerners that had gone to spend many nights in Sector 4. Several took an initiation with a baba. Some ended up spending several days of mind-numbing sitting around doing nothing until they realized that the baba was really more interested in getting money from them than
mini-IMG_0906
anything else.

I could never figure out what was going on in terms of money with the babas. One day I sat for several hours with one baba who was dressed in pretty normal clothes with a long beard, his hair was in a bun but was not dreaded and he wore dark sunglasses. He sat and tended his fire and called over passersby to put a thumbprint of ash on their forehead. He would then say some incantation and he would get them to give him money. It was impressive how effective his operation was. Within 30 minutes he had pulled in around 500 rupees or 10USD, not bad for someone who has supposedly given up all attachments in life. Virtually all of the babas I observed had a mobile phone and many of them even had large Indian made four-wheel drive vehicles that would shuttle them around. We called them baba-mobiles.

Baba bags are one of the most interesting things I learned about at the Kumbh Mela. These bags are woven bags usually of a mix of pastel colors. Genuine baba bags (they sell some baba bags in certain cities that would not be considered genuine
IMAG0520
but look like the real thing) are either made by the baba himself or given to by someone else who made it such as their guru or another guru or master. This strange Westerner said made it clear that only true initiates should have baba bags and that they should never be bought.

All over the Mela, at every crossroads and lining most of the roads were posters and banners for different gurus and their camps. Each poster had a photo of the guru advertising where their camp was located and when they would be speaking. Each guru I saw on a sign made me wonder is this guy for real? Many of the big gurus had large camps that centered solely around them. Some would fill large halls with thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of patient listeners who sat still for hours listening to the gurus ramble on and on. I went to see one camp with an enormous tent with what was supposed to be an audience of 200,000 people there to listen to some Mahatmas speak. Although it was a large crowd I doubt it was anywhere close to 200,000. Unfortunately without much Hindi it was
IMAG0537
all babble to me. I bought a small book there about finding your guru and how you should treat the guru as a god.

I played an imaginary game with my friends as we walked around. If you came to the Mela in order to find a guru but couldn’t read Hindi and could only base your decision on the photos of the gurus on their posters, who would you choose? Would you go for the guy who with the best smile or the one with the largest camp? Would you choose a guy with a lot of markings on his forehead or one with a simple red dot? Before going to the Mela I never considered the idea of taking a guru. While at the Mela I saw lots and lots of Westerners that had come with a guru and some were even trying to get people to jump on the bandwagon by encouraging other Westerners to come visit their camps and meet their gurus.

Everywhere you went at the Mela you were to encounter free food and tea being offered by different camps. They called it prashad or prasad and it was hard to say no.
IMAG0542
Some of the food I ate while walking around was some of the best I’ve eaten in India. Many of the camps used plates and bowls made of dried leaves. Some used plastic or styrafoam which resulted in a lot of unnecessary trash. I had my own stainless steel bowl and bamboo spoon that I carried with me everywhere. Also I had a nice cup made from a coconut shell that I had found on the sidewalk in Delhi but I left this at some baba’s camp towards the beginning of the Mela. Since coconuts were used as offerings to the Ganges I found plenty of other coconut shells to turn into cups.

On nearly every corner there was a chai stand. I love tea and stopped at nearly every chai stand that I passed. I found a really nice brass container that was sold at the Mela probably used to hold the red powder used for the forehead markings and bindis. In the village nearby I bought a bunch of spices to make chai with. I even bought a mortal and pestle to grind the spices up. I crushed up cinnamon, star anise, and cloves and put them
IMAG0555
in one of the brass containers. In another container I put in crushed cardamom. I carried both of these little containers with me at all times so that I could spice up my chai whenever I felt it was lacking flavor. The chai-wallas as they are called loved my spice collection, especially the cardamom which seems to be their favorite spice.

I also had with me two types of coffee, Arabic coffee with cardamom that I got in Egypt the day before the revolution started and Turkish coffee. From one baba I learned that it was really nice to boil some milk with a teaspoon of Turkish coffee and a bit of sugar. Unfortunately I didn’t have a lot of coffee with me and I wanted to save some for hiking in the Himalayas so I had to use it sparingly.

I had a crazy idea to go to one of the main streets in Sector 4 where everyone enters the Kumbh Mela and set up a chai teepee and give out free tea to everyone. I tried to recruit volunteers from Rainbow Camp for several days but I couldn’t find anyone who wanted to come with me
IMAG0647
until I met a young American guy who was up for it. He had been on an exchange program for the first semester of his senior year of high school in Indonesia. He decided not to return to finish school and had come to India instead. He had studied some Hindi and was able to communicate relatively well with the locals. He was up for an adventure and thought the chai teepee a good idea, at least for the experience of constructing it.

I had already bought two teapots, lots of tea, tea cups, five spices (cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, and fresh ginger), a mortar and pestle, a strainer, and a long handled pourer. I had found a blanket near the river and had a mat made of strips of bamboo. We walked from the Rainbow Camp to Sector 4, found a place and began to dig a hole for the fire. Our plan was to imitate the way that all of the babas at the Mela build a fire place by digging a hole then enforcing it with bricks that are then covered in mud. For the babas fire is holy and they call the fireplace dhuni,
IMAG0567
the fire is called an aga, while the ash they put on their body is called pashma.

Immediately as we started digging a huge crowd gathered to see what the crazy foreigners were doing. We explained we were going to build a fire and make tea and several people began to help. I went off to get some bricks and came back to see the beginning of a nice hole in the sand. The other American went off to find some firewood and I continued to build the fireplace with the help of two babas with dreads that obviously knew what they were doing. During this phase another baba came over and said that I couldn’t have a fire there because I wasn’t a naga baba. He left and I forgot about him as we worked to get the fire going. Onlookers brought wood, newspaper and some matches and the fire was going well enough to put the tea kettle on the fire.

Just as the water was about to boil the angry baba came back and said I was not a naga baba and therefore was not allowed to have a fire there and used his foot
IMAG0570
to fill in the entire fire pit with sand which basically put an end to the chai teepee idea. I waited for a while for the American to return with firewood and explained what had happened. We ended up meeting another naga baba who let us come over and make tea on his fire. He was a crazy fat old naked man that kept saying “me naga baba” as he pointed to himself. We made some tea, shared it around and he invited us to stay for food. Instead we decided as it was getting dark to try to get to the Hare Krishna camp in time for their dinner. We were just about the last people to be served in a near empty enormous tent of low tables. They served us a very delicious palak paneer, lentil soup, and hot chapattis. It was probably the best meal I had at the Mela. Afterwards we returned to Rainbow Camp disappointed but with a good story. Instead I decided to create a chai teepee at the Rainbow Camp that would be called Chai, Chillum, Chapati. This is a whole other story and a lot of effort that ended up resulting in
IMAG0592
very little.

As for the number of people who are estimated to visit the Mela I have to doubt that the figures are even close to being correct. I don’t doubt that this is the largest gathering of people in the world, but I doubt that the numbers of this Mela reach one hundred million as they predicted. I’ve read about several different ways they try to estimate the crowds and all seem very simplistic, not scientific in any terms. The figures they officially give seem more like guestimations rather than good estimations.

One of the biggest questions I had before attending the Mela was where and how do the millions of people relieve themselves. After seeing how freely people relieved themselves in normal cities in India I imaged a very nasty scene and prepared myself for the worst. How could it be possible for the whole place to not be smelly and full of flies with millions of people having to relieve themselves multiple times a day?

However, it turned out that their many, many years of experience led them to some simple ideas and overall the toilets were quite clean. The organizers of the Mela
IMAG0608
know that in a few months time everything will be washed away under water and that they don’t need to plan for the long term. They just dig some holes, put in some ceramic squat toilets and have people tend to them to make sure they are clean. These were placed every few blocks whereas urinals both men and women’s were placed next to the road ever few hundred feet. The urinal was some corrugated tin for walls and a pipe that collected and took away the urine. They then use a white lime powder that they put just about everywhere to disinfect. Although some of the urinals were pretty nasty, overall the toilet situation was better than any festival I’ve attended in the US. I despise the disgusting portable toilets with their blue chemical that ends up smelling horrible especially in the sun when they become saunas of stench.

I stayed on the dusty riverbed for 22 days and left just as a huge storm blew up and caused massive havoc which I was told destroyed the Rainbow Camp. I stepped on the bus back to Varanasi just as the first clap of thunder shook the ground and
IMAG0614
the torrential rain came pelting down in droves. I was happy to have been and happy to be going. My experience at the Kumbh Mela was beyond anything I could have ever imagined. It was definitely one of the best experiences of my life and I plan to visit the next large Mela in 2025. Hopefully by that time I can speak enough Hindi to be able to communicate with all of the babas and all of the locals. I thank everyone that I met for the incredible and unforgettable experience.

April 13th 2013
Published: June 25th 2017


Varanasi at Sunrise
We took this shot from our boat, as we cruised the river very early one morning to catch the sunrise. The amount of activity on the river even in the early morning hours was considerable, but in particular the meditators and yogis were everywhere.
The twenty nine hour train journey that we undertook to get to Varanasi left us understandably exhausted, and we were in no way prepared for the walk from our taxi tuk tuk drop-off point, to our hotel, with each of us having to carry our very heavy loads of luggage. We were shocked to discover at the drop off point that the tuk tuk could not, as per always, take us to our hotel doors because the streets to the hotel were too narrow for tuk-tuks to go through. Just as we were reluctantly debarking our vehicle with absolutely no idea of where to go, a young boy offered his services to guide us there. (Sadly for us, neither he nor any of his buddies were offering porter services). So our Varanasi adventure began, even before we arrived at our hotel, as we meandered for another twenty minutes through a half kilometre labyrinth of ancient, narrow, thick-walled streets heavily populated with people, animals (the usual supply of dogs, goats, and yes, cows), and of course, the odd bicycle and motorbike traveller squeezing by. We had not been in this reputedly overwhelming city for a half hour, and I was already overwhelmed.
Colorful Varanasi.
The architecture is astounding, as is the color, which is matched by the vibrancy of the activity that goes on along the river.


But arrive we eventually did, and after a restful night and very late sleep-in the next day, we were ready to venture out into this city of extremes to see what trips would be laid upon us.

My son Tanner, after visiting Varanasi a couple of years ago, described it as ""a full-on, in-your-face, head trip"". The Lonely Planet section on Varanasi begins with two words. ""Brace yourself."" One of the Holy Men we encountered on the banks described it with great passion as the ""City of Burning and Learning"", as it is (I believe) the birthplace of Lord Shiva, the Destroyer, whose purpose is to destroy that which is, so that rebirth and regrowth can take place. Or something like that. And the Ganges is, of course, the sacred river which all Hindus must come to bathe in at least once in their lives, for to do so is to have all bad karma from past lives washed away. Then, to be cremated on the banks of the Ganges and have your ashes dispensed into the river is to end the cycle of rebirth and obtain Nirvana. That is my understanding.

We began our exploring with
Bathing in the Ganges
This was a common sight, in spite of the debris floating everywhere in the vicinity. Mind boggling.
a river cruise in a small boat with a young boy who paddled us and two others along the banks to witness the action taking place that evening. We found it to be somewhat busy - there were perhaps a couple hundred other boats out as well, but did not realize until the next day that it was the Hindu New Year's Eve. In fact, we did not even know there was a Hindu calendar, and that this was the last day of the year 2069.

Our boat tour began, of course, at the burning ghat, or site where most of the cremations take place on the Ganges. We witnessed at least six burning piers from the distance of our boat that night, but returned again another evening for a much longer period to witness a more comprehensive story, which included watching a body being transported to its site, and the numerous rituals that take place in the preparation of the site and the body before it is finally laid upon the pire and the flames lit. Cremations on this site take place twenty four hours a day, every day of the year. Being an audience to the cremations
Holy Man on the Ganges
I wanted to ask him to turn around for the photo shot, but my Hindi just isn't that good, so this is it. You get the idea though, right?
is not discouraged at all, but taking photographs during a ceremony is considered very offensive. I did take some photos, however, of the site itself, containing the utterly massive stockpiles of wood which might begin to convey some sense of the sheer volume. However, there is no way to prepare the Western mind - or at least not this one - for the witnessing of a human body being clearly burned just feet away from you. There are no words. But the Hindus seem to take it all in stride, birth and death being one and the same in their pursuit of Nirvana.

The next day we had the pleasure of being guided in a small group of four by our very excellent hotel tour guide and host, Mannu, whose extensive knowledge base of both old and New Varanasi, delivered with both humour and passion, allowed us insights into this city that we would never have gotten on our own. One such insight was acquired in our visit to BHU - Benares Hindu University, Benares being one of Varanasi's four names. This very modern campus of several thousand students has fifty two faculties covering all disciplines - not just
New Year's Eve in Varanasi, India.
Here we are, with the crowds of people in boats and on shore, watching the ceremonies taking place. Because these ceremonies go on every night at the same time, we had no idea that this was New Year's Eve, until the next day. Happy 2070, India!
medicine and engineering - is the largest university in Asia, and every student we saw had to have an average of 90-95 percent or they would never have made the cut. In other words, it is the Harvard of India. We also visited a half dozen of the temples that are on campus, and a variety of other temples elsewhere in the city. But no tour is complete without stopping for lunch at Burger King, where the all-vegetarian menu is not quite the same as what we are familiar with back home. Our tour concluded with a guided walk through more maze-like narrow streets, vibrant with life, and I was a little disappointed we did not have the time to stop at this elegant shop filled with an array of beautiful long black dresses designed for Muslim women. Even Stan agreed that I should have one of those, being ""The Woman in Black"" and all, and we put it on the list of things to do tomorrow, which never did happen, as it turned out. Before we left Varanasi though, which we discovered is renowned as one of the best quality silk production centres in the world, we did manage
Ancient Palace Restoration on the Ganges
In its glory, the entire shoreline of Varanasi consisted of massive palaces of this stature. Most of them still remain, but many are visibly in disrepair. This one is being converted to a luxury hotel.
to have Mannu arrange for us another personalized shopping experience with a fourth generation silk merchant and world-scale wholesaler. It was reminiscent of our delightful shopping experience in Kashmir, and yes, we did pick up just one or two beautiful silk items before we left Varanasi, our last stop in India before moving on to Nepal.

I would have loved to say that our departure from this country was as exciting as our arrival in Pondicherry six weeks earlier. Or perhaps it was, but in a much less desirable way. Unfortunately, though, I became very ill at some point during our four day stay in Varanasi, so much so that I spent the last day there feverish and sleeping, with Stan at my side providing remedies he had, as well as food and beverages suggested by the caring hotel staff. I cannot remember ever being this sick in my entire life, with fever, headache, sore muscles, and joints that screamed out when I stretched, let alone tried to walk, all combined with nausea and diarrhea. When we left the hotel to catch our train later that evening, our hotel had arranged porters for us right to the train platform,
Yoga Class on the Ganges
This class was entirely Pranayama, or breathing, and the Brahmin teacher was instructing his class of young Hindu priests in training, the instruction for which was shared via loudspeaker that echoed clearly for everyone to hear. It was exactly the same teachings that the monk in Dharamsala had shared in his class, but without the loudspeaker in a quite different setting.
as I was barely able to carry myself, left alone any luggage. To say that the next twenty hours in transport in plus forty five degree temps was gruelling is a massive understatement. Although feverish, the worst had come and passed waiting at the train station in Varanasi, so I managed to sleep through the overnight train, the two hour taxi ride to the Nepali border, and the five hour taxi ride to our destination in Pokhara, Nepal. However, the two long hours at border crossings both leaving India and entering Nepal were brutal, as by then the gastric infection was playing havoc with me in full force. Suffice it to say that I left my mark as we departed India and entered Nepal. But the best part of all of this was having my lifelong partner and adventurer Stan at my side helping me through, being the amazing caregiver and man that he is, and we are both on the mend.

Now I totally understand what Stan experienced on his previous trip to India two years ago, the trip which inspired his Delhi Belly Weight Loss Club. And what sort of adventure tale with any authenticity does not
Washing Clothes in the Ganges
Washing clothes or swimming in the river happened at numerous points along the river. It was not in the least unusual for someone also to be meditating in the midst of all this activity, like the guy sitting on the pillar in the background to the left.

Fabulous Kulfis - Karol Bagh Delhi
Lucknow

So after a 2hrs 10 min flight from Bengaluru with Indigo we arrive at Lucknow airport just in time for sunset at 6pm. A few observations here:

The flight itself is good as usual with Indigo and the service excellent for a low budget airline. However, what catches our attention in the Indigo flight magazine is the Recruitment advertisement and the advert – extolling the “Girl Power” of their air stewardesses. Boy, are they blatantly and overtly sexist and racist in tone and content. Which is appalling and irresponsible for a corporate company at a time when India is struggling with the concept of the role of women in modern India and the inequalities and injustices they endure. We decide to write to the Company about this in the strongest terms and copy the newspapers.

The prepaid taxi fare from the airport is Rs 300 & the driver is on a mission to get us to the Lucknow Homestay (LH) in double quick time, taking no prisoners on the road. We do however seem to have a host of mossies for company and spend much of the journey waving our arms madly to get them
At the Elephant Fair that never was - Jaipur
off us and out the windows.

LH is in a quiet residential area about 1km from the main market and 3km from the train station. It’s very laid back and chilled. The rooms are basic but homely and comfortable (despite one of the temporary beds collapsing the first night!!) and freshly decorated. Our double with private bath is Rs 700 per day including breakfast. Filter water was provided as was tea & coffee + fridge facilities. There are 2 women who cook and clean. One did breakfast & the rooms, the other lunch and dinner if you chose to eat there. We did on 3 nights – fantastic vegetarian fare. Rs 75 per person. The only thing for foreign visitors is that they only spoke Hindi – so M to the rescue for translations etc.

On the first night we decide to go explore rather than have dinner in as C likes the look of Lucknow from the little we have seen on the 13km drive from the airport. We take a cycle rickshaw to Hazaratganj– the main shopping and eating area. We find the bottle shops (cold beer is Rs 100 in a small dive of a
By the river - Orchha
place where the guy trys to charge Rs 120, However we are now back on M’s turf – he was born in this state and his Hindi challenges the guy and we get it for the Rs 100 it should be.). Then we head to The Royal Café which Naheed the LH landlady has recommended. It’s a bit like the United Coffee House in Delhi and a bit of a local institution. Had we arrived ½ hour later we would have had to wait. It is Sunday night & it’s packed with local middle class folks – mainly families. The food is pretty good and service efficient. Outside in the day they have a chaat stand which we also try – great high quality chaat and a clientele of “ladies that lunch”.

For the remaining evenings we eat in and end the meals with long discussions about India mainly and then the rest of the world with the other guests. One is an Indian PhD student in economics he tells us – but why in Lucknow? Apparently applying for a new Indian passport and needs documents of residence & utility bills which he can get from here. He has
Cultural Dancers - Jaipur
folks in Bihar (near Patna) and clearly is from a middle class family. Ah the vagaries of the Indian Immigration system. There is also an elderly Dane – Rolf who now lives in Rome for 6 months of the year. The discussions were fuelled by some Sula red wine which they had kindly invited us to join them in the drinking of. It was an interesting travel through social topics such as politics, corruption, inequality, diversity, economics & the differences between Indian and Western cultures on these issues.

Also in the Guest House were 2 Americans (intense!) who had set up their own charity and now being funded by The Gates Foundation, doing research on various aspects of people’s lives in UP – amongst them an estimate of the % of people who crap outside in the country. Bizarre – only the Americans would consider this a worthwhile charitable project!! Next was Melissa (also intense) an American woman from Oregon who had spent 6 weeks with an NGO reviewing the issue of domestic violence in Lucknow. We are not sure from what she said that she added any value to the information that was already available. Finally we met
Holi Hai!! - Jaipur
Chuck – an American from New York who had lived in Japan, travelling post being laid off and soon to go to Sussex Uni to read Economics. He was keen to do a trek in Nepal so we got him in touch with our friends Siling & Tina of The Responsible Travellers.

All in all an eclectic mix of folk – but interesting and a change from our usual stopping places in India – we need a few more Homestays/Guest Houses like this. To add to it all, the landlady Naheed is lovely but totally disorganised. One got more information from the Guests about how things worked than her. We enjoyed our stay here – but it will not be everyone’s cup of tea.

Through the Guest House we arrange a day trip in a Rickshaw (Tuk Tuk) driven by a guy called Gautam who takes folks to see the “main highlights” of Lucknow. We say main highlights as the Tourists trail seems to focus on a very limited part and period of Lucknow i.e the time when the British were here, the royal time of the Oudh kings and not much else which we feel is a
Local Dancers - Holi Fair
shame. Lucknow seems to have a lot of little gems off the “Tourist Trail”, great buildings from and since the Raj, the Royal Muslim legacy – tombs, mosques and buildings etc.

The city is pretty spread out and has very little high rise development. The Muslim area and the area around the station are pretty poor and shows the down side of Indian life – yet the main drag – Hazaratganj – is largely about fancy & brand name stores, expensive restaurants and hotels, and the middle classes can be seem here in all their glory with chauffeur driven cars etc. Which brings us to a point of note – the traffic system in Lucknow is totally chaotic - worse than anywhere we have experienced in India. Cars, bikes, cycle rickshaws, Tuk Tuks, Tongas, cyclists, pedestrians all go for it in any direction. There is quite a heavy police presence and a few seem to be on random checks on motorists & bikers – fines (or bribes) on the spot!

The area near Hazaratganj also has the local Assembly building & government & Army offices – so the presence of police is pretty heavy – many with bullet
Khan Cha Cha's awesome rolls - Delhi
proof vests etc.

Back to our day trip in the Tuk Tuk. We start at about 9.30am and it’s supposed to take about 4 or 5 hours & you can use the guy to stop off anywhere to buy things etc. The highlights for us were:

La Martiniere School/College: the Indian equivalent of Eton. It’s a beautiful old building with a weird assortment of stone statues on the roof – angels, gargoyles etc. We get a view of the inside thanks to the caretaker. It’s very ornate with a chapel with a painted ceiling reminiscent of the Cistine chapel, lots of stained glass and wooden carved partitioning. In the basement (accessed through a mist of mossies!!) is the tomb of the founder – he’s revered here. In all the classrooms – which look like they haven’t changed since it was built, boys are taking exams. On the stone steps up to the entrance boys have carved their names (apparently they are given chisels for the purpose on passing out day), which is quirky. We look for Kiplings as we’ve been told he attended school here but no joy. Sir Cliff Richard was a student here apparently, a local
Baori - Bara Imambara - Lucknow
boy of course. The boys in their dark blue blazers with school crest and grey trousers remind M of his days at St Georges College Mussoorie – a similar institution with a good educational history. English Medium of course as they say in this part of the world.

The Residency: This was the British enclave at the time of what is termed the First War of Independence – what the history books and the Indians fail to acknowledge was that the uprising was actually led by a woman (a Muslim Begum) and that the 20K + people who died on their side were Muslims!! On the British side the losses were about 2000; a reflection of the superior fire power and military might which was reinforced by soldiers from other battalions. The grounds are quite well spread and one can get a sense of how things were. Many of the remaining buildings were destroyed in the battle with evidence of the fight (bullet & canon ball holes) – but well preserved since. There’s a small museum which helps with some of the detail. It’s well worth it.

Bara Imambara: this huge complex includes a mosque, gardens and a
Bara Imambara - Lucknow
beautiful stepwell.The main building has a maze of passageways and stairs that lead up to the roof for great views across the area. It was built by Asaf-ud-Daula, Nawab of Lucknow, in 1784. He is buried inside. It is also called the Asafi Imambara. Bara means big, and an imambara is a shrine built by Shia Muslims for the purpose of Azadari. The Bara Imambara is among the grandest buildings of Lucknow. It is picturesque and takes a while to get around.

Chota Imambara: A smaller complex not far away from the above, that is almost completely bonkers! (no disrespect intended as it’s clearly an important Muslim edifice). The outside is decorated with Islamic script which makes it very striking, in the grounds are a couple of mini Taj Mahals as tombs for family members, and inside the main building you could be forgiven for thinking you were in a massive antique/bric a brac shop. Chandeliers and glass lights from various countries adorn the place, there’s a huge silver throne, clock casements and all sorts of other ornaments. It was built by Muhammad Ali Shah, The third Nawab of Avadh in 1838, to serve as his own mausoleum. It is also known as
Sunset over the Chattris - Orchha
the Palace of Lights because of its decorations during special festivals.

We finish our tour with lunch at the locally famous Tunday Kebab restaurant in the heart of the chowk. The biryani is underwhelming but the speciality galawat kebabs are awesome – and cheap! So we have lots of them!!

So goodbye to Lucknow – we feel we could have done more here – maybe we are now tired of Indian cities. It is time for a change. We are looking forward to Japan as it will be such a big change. We head to Lucknow Railway station (it’s quite big, relatively clean and architecturally shows it’s Muslim roots) to catch the train to Jhansi where we will catch a rickshaw to Orchha (in Madhya Pradesh) for 2 days and then it’s onto familiar turf – Delhi & Jaipur before flying out.

Orchha - one of India’s hidden gems.

The train journey is uneventful though we get delayed right at the end so don’t get to Jhansi until 7-10pm – 40 minutes late. M negotiates a large auto rickshaw to Orchha (Rs 200 rather than the Rs 600 the hotel had offered for a pick up).
Bara Imambara gardens - Lucknow
The roads are pretty good and we get to the Fort View Hotel at 8-00pm.

The room is pretty basic – although with a TV which is a surprise, for Rs 800 per night. Unfortunately it’s also full of little bugs stirred up by the fan which doesn’t impress C greatly.

Orchha is a bigger place than we thought and we go straight out to find some dinner. Walking through town we can see the outline of the now defunct palaces, lit up by a sound and light show, and temples. We head for the Sheesh Mahal restaurant as its location is good in the middle of the palaces (and it serves beer) but the menu is rubbish so we go back into town to explore more options. It’s a bit limited! Many places are closing and the LP recommendation is empty and charges way over the odds for beer. In the end we try Blue Sky where the staff are very willing and friendly but the food loses a bit in the translation. Hey ho.

Next day we find Bhola restaurant for breakfast – right on the corner of the main crossroads – which does great
Chota Imambara - Lucknow
food and is always packed with foreign travellers. Fresh fruit juice, good coffee and they know how to cook eggs. Just along from Bhola is Ramraja restaurant which is always packed with locals – and we can see why when we try it for lunch. Awesome thali for Rs 160.

As we walk around in the day time, three things strike us; most of the buildings fronting the main street are half demolished, the town is bustling and noisy though in a good way – from the LP description we’d expected a quiet backwater, and finally, it’s nothing at all like Khajurao – another LP description. The half demolished buildings are due to a road widening that started 6 months ago. Folks seem happy about it and there’s lots of work rebuilding homes and businesses. The bustling and noise is because Orchha is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus – it has the only Temple in India where Ram is revered as a King (Ram Raja Temple). While we are here there is a festival one night and hundreds of pilgrims walk into town or arrive in super packed jeepneys (auto rickshaws designed to carry 8 and easily accommodating
Gautam our guide & driver - Lucknow
18!). And as for being like Khajurao – no idea where that comes from.

Orchha is in fact a little gem of a place. The palaces and temples straddle the Betwa river and at the far end of town you can walk to some really impressive cenotaphs that border the river where it flows at its fullest. We don’t actually buy a ticket to go into the palaces as we enjoy just walking around the gardens and amongst the ruins. The insides don’t look very well preserved and most of the attraction is climbing up inside for the views. The ground level view looks fine to us.

Interestingly the entrepreneurial folk (some women, quite a few kids and most Sadhus) have learnt some English to help them along. Its ""Hello….. Money” or “Picture …… Money”. The Sadhus more often just say Hello and stand there hoping for something or start playing some instrument (symbols or bugle) and hope you will reward their effort or rather pay them to shut up!! But its good natured and not hard core begging like in the cities of India where they really get up front and personal – which is really annoying
Inside the Chota Imambara - Lucknow
& a few have gone away with a flea in their ear for it from M and other Indians who don’t like it happening to foreigners; Indians seem to be ignored from this ridiculous practise. This is not to suggest that there aren’t the needy and one can see quite a few examples of them – but oddly enough they are not aggressive at all.

Our final day in Orchha, we have a train from Jhansi back to Delhi at 11-30 pm, so rather than kill time in the heat; we keep the room for the day (at a cost). Good decision. We spend some time wandering around again then when it gets too hot, retreat to the room to catch up with some admin. We wander out again for sunset, back down to the river to see the sun setting behind the cenotaphs – it’s the advertising pic for here.

The rickshaw we had negotiated turns up at 8 pm to take us the 15km to Jhansi station for 11.35pm train to Delhi. Surprisingly the 3 hour wait at the station is not too bad as the waiting room is pretty good and we have access to
La Martiniere School - Lucknow
a recharging point so use the laptop to keep busy (apart from a light snacky dinner from the 24 Hours Food Junction).

Delhi – preparing for Japan

So it’s back to “Base Camp” which is what Delhi feels like now. We arrive at 6.30 am at Nizamuddin train station (the terminal stop for the train from Jhansi). This is the first time that we are glad that the train is late as we should have been here at 5.30 am. After a quick coffee we negotiate a rickshaw to Rajiv Chowk as the Metro will now be operational.

We get to the Namaskar Hotel in Karol Bagh where we stayed when we first arrived in India. After a quick nap by miss lazy (tired she insists!) while M starts the process of getting ready for the last few days in India & reducing our travelling stuff down to one large rucksack only – we get ready for a quick lunch at Khan Cha Cha’s in Rajiv Chowk – fab! We visit here again on our last night for dinner (Biriyani sold out – that speaks volumes but we get to grips with a host of different kebabs
Mosque - Bara Imambara - Lucknow
in a roll – Romalli roti so not so greasy). Fantastic and we’d like to open a franchise wherever we are. There are more outlets of this eatery in around Delhi. We have tried their Khan market outlet and it’s just as good – it all started there!

We leave another luggage rucksack at Tony’s office. We meet up with him briefly and his “Jeeves” Shankar. This takes a load off our mind and hopefully will help with our travels in Japan & more so in the Philippines where we will have to leave the large rucksack in Manila and use it as a base for travelling as much of what we intend to do requires us to travel really light (one day sack each!!). One hell of a challenge!!

We really discover more of Karol Bagh for a change and it has a lot to offer, there are new eateries since we were last here, a new beer & wine shop nearby, we make it at last to Roshan De Kulfi for reputedly the best Kulfi in Delhi (justified we feel) – we even go there for dinner one night. The market area is big and it
Double Decker train - Delhi
seems one could get anything here and it goes on till late at night. The other food gem we come across here is the Punjabi Sweet Centre – chole batura to die for (Rs 60).

Jaipur – the Elephant Fair & Holi

The Elephant Fair – what no elephants?!

So, we are ready for our final India excursion – well, at least for 2 months. We are up at 4.15 am to get our train from New Delhi station to Jaipur for the Elephant Fair today. We manage to get a rickshaw at slightly a higher rate (but worth it) at 5.20 am near the Karol Bagh station. This was after a young couple had stopped in their car to offer us help or a lift as they had seen us walking down the main road at that hour looking for a cab. This restores our faith Delhi folks and we assume is a result of all the publicity surrounding the incidents of rape etc given a lot of media coverage in the press locally. However, they are not going our way & a rickshaw guy pulls up behind them who we take for the ride to
Dancers - Holi Fair - Jaipur
the station.

New Delhi station is enormous – it has 16 platforms and is in pretty good shape and being modernised. There are 2 entrances – one from Paharganj and the other from the Rajiv Chowk. So knowing which platform you want will help reduce the amount of walking with luggage you have to do.

The train starts here and our coach (2 A/C coach seats) is filled with about 40 young girls from Waverley school. M reminisces that there was a Waverley in Mussoorie (where he went to school) and when we chat to some of them (they want to know where we’re from and what we’re doing) it turns out they are from that school. They are intrigued by the ex St Georges “uncle” and one even declares he looks like Ruskin Bond - a famous Mussoorie based author. They are from many countries and very well educated and polite; it’s interesting to meet them.

The Shatabdi Express is recommended by many travellers and we can see why; coffee on arrival, free water, and breakfast (not bad veg cutlets) are included in the price.

We arrive in Jaipur and are met by Fateh, the
Mosque at The Residency - Lucknow
son of the Colonel who owns the guesthouse where we are staying – Shahar Palace. Unfortunately the Colonel (ex Army and a hoot) is in hospital recovering from an accident - the result of a bike hit and run accident & he’s broken his knee and is in traction; we wish him well – he’s a great fellow. Fateh is a Polo player and well established in Rajasthan with the nobility – he’s also a nice guy.

We soon meet up with some fellow Brits (Rosie who is planning to live in Jaipur part time, Sarah from Majorca who is also planning to live in India part time, and Lotte from Islington who is a student) and compare travel notes, then after a catch up on emails we head to the Elephant Festival.

We have come here specially for this, otherwise we would have been in Japan 2 weeks ago. The festival is in the grounds of Rambagh Palace and as we sit there waiting for the start Rosie gets a call to say the Elephant Festival has been cancelled following a petition!!! Instead, they have renamed it The Holi Festival (as Holi – the festival of colours
The Entrance - Bara Imambara -Lucknow
to celebrate the start of spring is the next day) and now there will be a display of Rajasthani cultural dances and arts to celebrate Holi. Or as she put it – an Indian village fete!! Odisha revisited!

C is very p****ed off with Rajasthan Tourism as she checked the site just an hour before and there was no mention of it being cancelled. She can feel a complaint coming on.

The Festival is pretty much a farce. The commentator (a complete and annoying pratt from the Polo club who likes the sound of his own voice too much) and the dancing troupes are swamped by the media and photographers so you can’t actually see anything even if you stand at the barrier. About 20 mins too late the compere suggests folk sit down – no chance! We leave.

As we’re on familiar territory, we head to the beer shop for a couple of beers, do a bit of blogging then head down to a pre-ordered dinner with all our favourites and really nicely cooked. We meet Matt & Lauren from California who are in India on a whistle stop 3 week tour north to south and
The Museum - The Residency, Lucknow
west to east!! Sounds exhausting. We also chat with Charles & Natahsa, dentists from Wales who are off to work in Oz via Goa!! And Ektar who is from India but now lives in Dubai and is travelling on photo shoots.

Holi – the festival of colours and welcome to spring

We get up and get ready for Holi not quite sure how things are going to roll. We thought that there may be some fun in the neighbourhood which is a pretty middle class area and it’s likely to be less problematic as Holi can get a bit chaotic in some places with oil colours, people high on bhang and misbehaving, or folks throwing acid (in extreme cases). After a quiet breakfast, Fateh invites everyone down for the festivities to begin – it’s now about 11 am. He has bought in some dry colours for all to share and loads of beers, whisky and rum (Army supply Aristocrat from the Colonel’s stock no doubt) & coke. Some of the other guests have also bought colours for the event. The fun begins and it’s all pretty good natured but really good fun and everyone joins in. The booze
More dancer - Holi Fair - Jaipur
helps and it keeps coming.

A few adventurous ones decide to go into Jaipur city and come back later covered with oiled colours which they are still sporting the next day! C ventures out with a few others into the neighbourhood & it’s a watery colour fest; fortunately the kids keep their aim away from the camera. Fateh then goes off to a Heritage Hotel where his friend has laid on a bash Rs 3000 per head – only Ekta goes with him. The rest continue to enjoy Holi in the House garden. There are savouries and Indian sweets provided as well; so all in all it’s a great fun day.

We skype with Sarah about her flat issues (Services Charges issue) and she takes a picture of us all coloured up and puts it on Facebook. Cool or what!!

When it’s all over we all shower and meet in the dining area. Most of the colour has come off – except for some reason in the cleavage of all the women!! And we have no idea how it all got there (or they are not letting on anyway)!! We have a lovely dinner again, exchange emails
Inside the Palace grounds - Orchha
and then an early night for an early start in the morning back to Delhi.

Fateh has arranged a rickshaw at 5am, and we take a double decker train – the first for us in India – at 6 am for an rather uncomfortable 4.5 hours to Delhi as the seats don’t go back and are really badly designed, in addition - no breakfast either this time!!

Off to Japan!

So after another day tasting the delights of Khan Cha Cha and Karol Bagh, we do some final re-organising of bags and have an early night to head off in the morning to Delhi airport for our flight to Japan. Arun at Hotel Namaskar arranges a cab for Rs400 and we get to the airport T3 at 10 am, to check in for our Air Malaysia flight at 1-00pm. If all goes to plan we shall be in Tokyo in the morning. It will be a huge contrast and we’re looking forward to it.

A room with a view
The view from my room in Gangtok
For Spring break I was going to stay in Sikkim with Nicole. It is absolutely beautiful there! Sarah, an American grad students helping us, offered her apartment in Varanasi to Lily, Nicole, and I. So we spent two more days in Gangtok, Sikkim then took an overnight train to Varanasi. It was so nice to have a space all to ourselves. We all did want we wanted, reading and visiting friends. Hemant was back from school so we got to hang out with him and Saurabh. We also got to see Manoj, Anandi, Shiv, Guria, Manish, Dali Ji, Debbie Ji and many of our friends. I liked Varanasi the first time but it was a hundreds times better going back to visit friends.

Highlights:

We went to Saurabh's village again and hiked to a waterfall. We finally went swimming!

Jayni had Jayni-babies!

Diwan-i-Khas
On the 7th, we woke up a little later than planned because Scott wasn't feeling well, ate breakfast on our hotel's rooftop (where we caught our last glimpse of the Taj), and caught a rickshaw to the public bus stand. Here, we waited in a dilapidated old bus for almost an hour before it finally departed for the ancient city of Fatehpur Sikri, about a two hour drive away. We arrived around 1:30 and ate lunch at a guesthouse that was kind enough to allow us to store our packs there while we toured the ruins, since we were only planning to be in town for a few hours before hopping on another bus bound for Jaipur.

We began our tour at the Jama Masjid Mosque, which had no entry fee, but, as our guidebook warned us, proved to be a less than hassle free experience. First, we had to take our shoes off, and, considering this was a holy structure, I had no problem respecting it; however, the open air square was not only extremely hot to the bare foot, but was also covered with pigeon feces and overflowing with relentless touts who tried to persuade us to visit
Panch Mahal
their makeshift ""shops"" as well as beggar children who followed us around asking for money, chocolate, and (for whatever reason) pens. Many of them approached Scott by pointing to his beard and calling him Ali Baba. This was the first time he'd experienced this, but ever since then it's happened several times a day.

Though the mosque was very beautiful, the circumstances made it very difficult to enjoy, so we took a quick look around, saw the tomb of the Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Christi (in whose honor Fatehpur Sikri was constructed), and moved on to the Royal Palace. This area was much more peaceful and contained impressive architecture dating back to the late 1500s when the Mughal emperor Akbar had it built, though, for reasons unknown, only reigned there from 1569-1585. We wandered around the surprisingly intact palace grounds for a few hours, taking pictures and trying to avoid having ours taken by strangers. We did agree to have our picture made with a nice family who actually asked our permission first, rather than just sticking a camera in our faces. The father then told us that this was the ""proudest picture of his life""...or maybe he said
Buland Darwaza (Great Gate)
""his wife""...in either case, he was nice, but his comments were a bit strange.

Once we'd finished touring the area, we collected our packs and attempted to figure out where we were supposed to go to catch our bus to Jaipur. The owner of the guesthouse suggested we take a tonga (horse drawn cart) to the Agra Gate bypass, which we did, albeit unwillingly, since there were no rickshaws. The horses were ragged and gaunt and didn't appear to be well cared for, not to mention the driver repeatedly whipped and spanked ours during our short ride. When we reached the ""bus stand,"" we were quite unsure as to whether we were in the right place. It was basically just a random spot on the side of the road. A guy on a motorcycle stopped to help us and told us that, yes, we were in fact in the right place, which was nice, but then he lingered and didn't say much other than to tell Scott that he had picked a good wife and that he looked like Ali Baba. He also told me that he liked my green eyes and wanted to know if I would give
Muslim Girl
him my Clemson class ring, to which I declined. Eventually, after telling us which bus to take, he rode off with his friend, and our bus arrived soon after. Luckily there were seats available and enough room for our bags, so we settled in for the four hour journey.

Despite the seats being somewhat uncomfortable and the bus making a few long stops, everything was going fine until about 9:00 p.m. when our driver began yawning, stretching and shaking himself to stay awake. We could see that his eyes were half closed in the rear view mirror, and he kept swerving and almost hitting things, so we knew something was up. We informed the ticket officer of our concerns, but he quickly brushed them aside as if we were crazy...when it became even clearer that the driver was struggling, we approached the officer again. This time he became frustrated with us and moved to the front of the bus to talk to some other passengers and mock us without even checking to see if the driver was having trouble. Thankfully, the driver's cell phone rang, and he answered it and lit up a cigarette (two things I normally would
Jama Masjid
not have been thankful for), which at least woke him up enough to get us to Jaipur safely a little after 10:00 p.m.

A man from our hotel arrived shortly after to pick us up. He was very friendly, but immediately began trying to get us to hire him for a day of sightseeing, to which we politely declined. Once at our hotel, the Hotel Moon Light Palace, we were greeted by the staff and shown to our very nice, spacious room - what with the hotel staff's attentiveness and friendly demeanor and, I must add, above par laundry service, this was definitely one of the best hotels we've stayed in. They even had room service!

On our first night, we immediately dropped our packs in the room and headed up to the rooftop for a very late dinner. This was accompanied by the lovely ambiance of a multicolored disco ball and a three song playlist set on repeat. The food was great, but after that we stuck with room service, haha. We went to bed and slept pretty late the next day. I woke up with a bad back ache, so Scott, being the wonderful husband that
Beautiful Stonework
he is, gave me a massage with some Ayurvedic cream, which helped a bit. Then we ordered breakfast and hit the town - the incredibly dusty and polluted town, that is (we found out that the nearly unbreathable air was due largely in part to a significant number of construction projects that were underway in Jaipur).

Our first stop was the famous Lassi Wallah stand, where we ordered sweet lassis in disposable clay glasses (which I had way too much fun smashing afterwards). After that, we didn't do much sightseeing, but instead visited the city's government craft emporium to get a feel for souvenir prices before going to the bazaar to shop a bit. Rajasthan is known for its colorful textiles, leather work and handicrafts, so I was eager to see what was available. We looked for wall hangings, but were unable to find exactly what we wanted. I did find a pair of nice leather flats, some bangles, and, after spending over two hours in a textiles shop, seven wrap skirts...yes, seven. I have an affinity for Indian wrap skirts, and, lucky for me, I also have a very patient and generous husband. 😊 Granted, the total cost
Samrat Yantra - Giant Sun Dial accurate to 2 seconds
of all these skirts would get me about two in the states, but still...I can't wait until I have the money to buy him lots of presents!

After our shopping excursion, we were exhausted and decided to head back to our hotel for dinner. During our walk, we approached a cow, and, as usual, veered to the side to allow it room to pass us. This cow, however, must have been in a bad mood because, as I passed it, it turned its head towards me and hit me in the leg and back with its horns...OUCH. This was rather unpleasant and painful, but, all bruises aside, it makes for a good story!

We continued walking and were stopped by some locals who wanted to talk to us, so we obliged. We were having a good conversation with them when their friend, an Indian native who lives in Switzerland, showed up and took over, talking about healthcare, ayurvedic treatment, etc. and rarely letting anyone get a word in. After awhile, our hunger got the best of us, so we set out to find either a shop where we could buy minutes for our phone so we could call
Astronomical Measuring Device in Jantar Mantar
our hotel for a ride, an internet cafe to look up directions, or a rickshaw driver who knew the way. Eventually we found the latter, although he lied to us about some roads being closed and overcharged us. We ate dinner in the room, then went downstairs to figure out how we were going to get train tickets to Jaisalmer (our next desination), where we were going to stay, and which company we wanted to book a camel safari with. After awhile, we got to talking with the hotel's night manager and an English guy staying at the hotel. The manager was amazed by Scott's beard and was eager to show us pictures of his house and family, which was fun. He was very nice and quickly referred to us as his new friends.

The next day, Scott ended up having to go to the train station to buy us taktal tickets while I stayed behind and blogged. Afterward, we ate breakfast and went via public bus to the Pink City to see the palace and the observatory, which contained lots of awesome, huge structures constructed a long time ago to tell time, zodiac signs, the placement of the
City Palace
sun, etc. and which still function today. Before sightseeing, we had to make a brief stop at the doctor's office because I was having bad stomach pains again. This took less than half an hour, and was very cheap for a change.

We were stopped by several people throughout the day who wanted to talk to us, two of whom began by asking us why tourists are so suspicious of Indians. We thought it was strange to be asked the same question phrased the same way by two different people, but we tried to explain to them that, as tourists, many people approach us kindly, but ultimately have the motive of selling us something. Even if they're nice and aren't trying to sell something, tourists tend to be skeptical. One of the guys, after talking with us for awhile, was kind enough to help us get a good deal on a rickshaw to our lunch destination.

We ate a late lunch at a western cafe called Anokhi, which was a nice change of pace. It was good to get some raw veggies and non-spicy food, especially since I wasn't feeling well. After that we went to the shop
Beautiful Arches
connected to the cafe, which had good quality textiles, clothing and decor, but for western prices. I bought two cloth-covered journals and some bandanas, but Scott and I resisted the urge to buy one of their comfy patterened quilts. We then went downstairs to bookstore called Crosswords to see if they had any crossword puzzles...which they did not. Talk about false advertising!

The next day, our last in Jaipur, we stayed at the hotel all day because we didn't feel like venturing out into the dust and wanted to take it easy. I spent most of the day blogging and skyping with my family, but we also met some friendly folks from New Zealand with whom we chatted for awhile. Around 11:00 p.m., the owner of our hotel drove us to the train station free of charge, which was nice of him. The station turned out to be packed with people, mostly high-school and college aged. There were very few foreigners on our platform, and we found ourselves surrounded by herds of Indian students, who we were informed were from remote villages all over India and were only in town to take exams and, apparently, raise hell. A local
City Palace
told us that every year around this time the students flood into Jaipur, vandalizing public property, sitting on top of trains, and, in our case, harassing tourists. As soon as we set our packs down to wait for our train, a huge crowd of these students, as well as other Indians, gathered around us in a semi-circle simply to stare at us. Supposedly, in India it's not considered rude to stare, but these kids were pointing and laughing, and there were so many of them that we became not only anxious and uncomfortable, but eventually angry. One guy came over to us to explain that they didn't know any better, but, though his intentions seemed good, he kind of defended their behavior and didn't try to ask them to stop.

After dealing with the staring and snickering for almost an hour, I did something very rare for me. I stood up, went over to the group's ring leader, got about an inch away from his face (at which time he realized I was about a head taller than him), and began yelling at him to leave us alone. I wasn't exactly proud of this, but it seemed to do
Gateway and Guard
the trick because he and his posse left after that. The staring continued, but our train arrived soon enough, and we were able to ""seek refuge"" in our berth. Once I got situated and calmed down after feeling as if I were a caged zoo animal, I was able to fall asleep and get a full night's rest. I woke up at 10:00 a.m. and looked out the window to see the desert stretching in all directions, and at 11:30 a.m. we arrived in Jaisalmer.

Lesson learned: Ignorance is all around us. Try not to sweat the small stuff, however uncomfortable it may make you feel. Better to keep your cool than to get worked up and take things personally.

March 15th 2013
Published: March 15th 2013


The Watchman
Someone leaning over your table at a desolate, dirty old bar in Delhi to inform you that the place you are about to travel to “takes no prisoners” is always concerning. But as two South Africans and One New Zealander discovered, this couldn’t be further from the truth. The destination in question was

Varanasi AKA the home of the great Ganges River AKA a place we should brace ourselves for, apparently.

So in the words of Journey “we took the midnight train…” from Delhi to Varanasi. Turns out the midnight train deserves the title “takes no prisoners” far more than the city does! This train orders you aboard, sleeps you at the mercy of the three or four other passengers in your cubical, and can’t be done without a small prayer.

We were in sleeper’s class. (You could pay more and be a lot more comfortable.) This involves signing a waiver to say you won’t blame the train company if you get ‘poisoned, raped, or murdered’, and a hard bed without a blanket or pillow.

The journey’s a long one and we arrived in Varanasi after more than 12 hours travelling. Looking around Varanasi’s
Varanasi
train station it seemed we had been transported back to India circa 1930. Beggars and hungry children congregated at the old, run-down station. As we ventured into the harsh light of day we were greeted by cows, dust, dirt, tuk-tuk’s, and no roads in sight.

And there we were. Varanasi. A city of many names: “the spiritual capital of India,” “the holy city,” or to quote the best one I’d heard so far, “The oldest living city on earth.” One can only imagine how many incarnations these cows had been through.

The first thing you notice upon arrival is that it’s nothing like the other parts of India. Oh no, Delhi and Mumbai ain’t got nothing on this spiritual being. Varanasi has a real yesteryear charm to it, and a spirit that rises from the ashes burning daily along the Ganges. It’s warm, inviting, and there is something spectacular about the stone buildings with their ever present rooftop wash lines. At dusk, another name for Varanasi could be the “City of Kites” as you can glance up to the sky and see hundreds of them.

Varanasi is a place for the mind to wander,
The Morning Bath
and for the fast pace of the western world to be mocked. These people are interested in spirituality, bathing in their beloved Mother (the Ganges), and finding comfort in the fact that upon death they will be returned to her.

Varanasi is littered with grimy, intricate alleyways that resemble little mazes. You never know what’s around the corner - from heaving black and white cows to rusty old dogs eating last week’s garbage.

We attended a cremation ceremony at sunset. Once again, the familiar smell of incense and candles filled our nostrils as trails of smoke bellowed forth from the flames of the ceremonial fire.

It’s a strange thing watching a cremation. Yet here, partly due to the primary faith being Hinduism, there is a very different attitude towards death. Bells, chants, and bright colours are a staple in India, and they were a staple this night as well, as attendees celebrated death rather than mourning it.

The following morning we were up before dawn to see something all visitors’ witness: a sunrise on the Ganges. A pulsating ripple of joy flowed through my body as I watched the sun make its
Curiosity
way up from the horizon against a backdrop of Indian men rowing along in their boats. Once the sun had risen, we were greeted by a barrage of sights. There were young men helping old ladies into the river to wash. There were old men and women praying. There were groups of ladies laughing and talking to each other as they washed. And then there were the men who left little to the imagination as they immersed themselves completely naked in the waters of the Ganges. Of course…we were the ones imposing on them.

We retired for breakfast at the superb Pizzeria Vaatika Café – a popular haunt for foreigners. We ordered paneer cheese sandwiches and famous Chai Masala tea. It is the staple drink here in India, and has a delightfully sweet-peppery taste. After breakfast, we strolled alongside the mighty Ganges. There we saw an old man sitting on a ledge facing the river, looking like an ancient watch-keeper.

It is all about birth, and rebirth in this city. Every night smoke bellows from the cremation ceremonies, while every morning the city is revived and resurrected through the art of bathing. I met several tourists
Sunrise on the Ganges
who had found themselves half way through a masters or PhD program only to discover that it wasn’t what they wanted to do any longer. These people had come to Varanasi to cleanse their minds of what they thought they wanted to be. We encountered a Canadian man that had found himself on the cusp of 27, half-way through a master’s degree that was “boring him to death”. He spent his days drawing Indian gods and gurus on the rooftop of our guest house overlooking the Ganges. Most mornings he would wonder down to the Ganges River, and most evenings we would chat about life and our career choices. He surprised us one evening by informing us that he might even look into English Teaching in Korea after he leaves India.

Our Tuk-tuk driver was very obliging in Varanasi, and post Ganges River our driver and tour guide took us to a temple that was plastered in ancient Hindi and Buddhist script. We were given flower necklaces and had some kind of powder pressed into our foreheads by a holy man. We were introduced to a stone cow, draped in necklaces, and told to whisper our most private
Laundry
wishes into his ear. A strange thing to do when you realize you are whispering to a fake cow, surrounded by intrigued Indian locals. We then checked out a silk market where scarves, duvets, and table runners were flung in our direction. Much like Thailand or Cambodia these shops are all about the tourists and getting a sale, but they still showed us a bit of Varanasi’s culture. Plus, the delicate, smooth feeling of the silk is worth it. Silk shops are littered throughout the city, and young men spend their days working the silk in small shops, while cows lounge about outside.

In the end, I found Varanasi undeserving of its title as the city that “takes no prisoners”. Don’t get me wrong, it doesn’t. And it never will. You either take Varanasi as it is or you ship out immediately. But there’s also another train of thought you can dive into. That is Varanasi with all its dust and dirt, grime and slum-like charm, relaxed locals and at times confused foreigners, being a city that is “not for the faint hearted”.

5th March 2013



'The Pearl of India'



And so we came to Agra.

For, as the Eiffel Tower is to France, Sydney Harbour Bridge is to Australia and the Statue of Liberty is to The United States of America, so the Taj Mahal is to India. It is impossible to miss. Impossible to miss on your first visit to India. Impossible to miss at any given opportunity, as my little brother Mike will tell you. This is his fifth visit.



The city of Agra is much like any other; at least any other in the India we have observed on this journey. There is richness indeed and there is poverty aplenty. But there is also much of beauty. And there is little doubt from our reading that the Taj Mahal is a thing of beauty beyond belief.- and best seen at sunrise or sunset.



Another long night, dreaming of tomorrow. It's 06.30 and we're standing in the long queue waiting for security and body checks as
Sunrise Taj Mahal

the gates open at sunrise, 06.41.

There is only one real reason to visit Agra and this is the moment. Through the gate the pace quickens, much in the way a football crowd faces the moment of anticipation, the kick-off in an important match.

It's sunrise at the 17th century Taj Mahal, built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Love is a very powerful thing; and it shows the very instant the long awaited image appears through the entrance arch. A giant pearl glistening in mellow sunlight, a fine romance in symmetry, a 44m high dome at its centre, cornered by four tapering minarets; a true masterpiece of feminine elegance. This first sight is accompanied by a sharp intake of breath as the throng stands silently in awe. A lady beside us, British perhaps, wiped her eyes with a tissue. 'I'm sorry', she sobbed. 'I can't help but cry.'

For it is indeed a tear-drop. The Taj Mahal stands in a world of its own, without the distraction of any thing other than a cobalt Indian sky; a white marble monument to love, embelished with intricate floral patterns of
Taj Mahal 3
inlaid precious stones. Above the Lotus Pool, people jostle to be photographed on the 'Diana' marble bench as we join the camera snappers for one last classic picture. This is without question the world's most beautiful building. We had to see it twice.



Our arrival in Agra at midday the previous day allowed us time to visit the 16th century Mughal marble tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah. Intricate stone inlay sparkled in the afternoon sunlight and latticed stone partitions threw dappled light on the marble floors of this quite delightful garden tomb, often referred to as the 'Baby Taj'. On reflection we were marking time; delaying the raptuous moment when we first set our eyes on the real thing. That moment was scheduled to be savoured at sunset; around 6.30pm, from Mehtab Bagh, the gardens across the river.



Still marking time, we ventured to Agra Fort. Yes, another Red Fort, high above the Yamuna River, its red sandstone ramparts standing proudly beyond the dry moat. There are many beautiful buildings within the walls of the fort but the imposing arches of the courtyard of the Diwan-i-Aam, where the emperor held public audiences are a delight to
Taj Mahal at Sunset
behold. It's possible to sneak a preview of the Taj Mahal from the fort ramparts, half a mile distant, our first peek so to speak, a stolen moment while the magical lady is not looking. In our excitement we finally arrived across the river with an hour to spare, strolled the gardens of Mehtab Bagh and sat on a wall behind the barbed-wire security fence patrolled by armed guards, staring in quiet disbelief as the sun's warm glow finally fell across the dazzling white marble dome and minarets.



Later that same evening, we returned to the fort for the 'Son et Lumiere', in English. Sad to relate, we all nodded off. It had been another long day. An Indian lady introduced herself to us while we waited for the show. Dorothy told us she teaches English at a school in Delhi. Now we understand why all Indains speak English with that delightful lilting Indian accent.



The Agra to Delhi toll motorway has been open for just 6 months, cutting a great swathe through flat farmland and acres of brickworks, but there is little traffic using the six lanes and it all seems rather a
Agra Fort 1
The imposing arches of the courtyard of the Diwan-i-Aam,
waste of money just yet. Perhaps it's the tolls that restrict the traffic. Many lorries stood broken down on the hard-shoulder and rescue vehicles were busy pulling wrecked cars from the surrounding fields. Speed awareness and proper vehicle maintenance will come with time no doubt and speed is evidently the cause of most accidents in the country - or is it wandering cows? Signs by the roadside read; 'Divorce your speed, not your wife', 'Kill your speed - better late than never', and 'We like you, but not your speed'.



There are signs of progress in the countryside too. Mahindra, Ford, Farmtrac and Massey Ferguson tractors feature amongst the home-made variety, all towing excessive loads or carrying a dozen or two farmhands to the fields in trailers. Newspapers talk of a horrific scam surrounding government loan waivers given to farmers to purchase new tractors. Only a tiny proportion of the money ever bought tractors or reached the farmers aparently. An investigation is under way. Corruption is rife here if you believe the newspapers and that's not helping the economy.



Delhi

Imagine! A city of 20m people. India's capital city. With only a day
Baha'i House of Worship
or two here, there's insufficient time for us to count them all. Tower block after tower block rises on the skyline as we navigate our way to our homestay near the centre. Our priority is to visit Old Delhi, to savour the sights, sounds and smells of this ancient city centre. Hankering for some relief from the hot spices of Indian food we ventured into a Chinese restaurant, only to be disappointed. The Chinese are hedging their bets and serving their meals spiced up for the Indian palette!



A ten-minute walk to the Metro took us past pavement dwellers in their tarpaulin shelters, washing at the communal tap, kids playing, mums cooking, holes in the footpath and no manhole covers. The streets are clean and Delhi's Metro is fast, efficient and also spotless. Two Metro journeys for the three of us totalled 130 Rupees, £1.37! To get things underway we made a start at the Mehrauli Archaeological Park, a fascinating complex of Muslim ruins from the late 12th century. The focus is the monumental Qutb Minar victory tower standing 72.5m high. One cannot wonder at the skills required to erect such a structure using bamboo poles and
Lotus Temple
rope for scaffolding and manual labour to craft the stone. Deep in this thought, I sat quietly in the shade for a moment, mopping perspiration from my brow - and managed to sit on my glasses! Bad news. But this is not necessarily the end of the world for the seasoned traveller who always carries his old prescription glasses somewhere in the suitcase - which happens to be back at the homestay. Never mind. Press on regardless but watch where you're going and don't expect to read the menu at lunchtime.



Somehow we found our way to the Old Delhi we had come to see and with lady-luck back with us ended up in vision alley! Spec shops galore! We picked the most friendly looking shop, where Janice produced one lens and a screw from her bag and I scrabbled around in my pocket for the rest. The optician looked down at the tangled mess of wire, two loose lenses and a couple of tiny screws, shaking his head in disbelief. 'Can you do anything with this?' I ventured to ask.

He waggled his head right and left, right and left, in true Indian fashion. I'm
Qtub Minar - Delhi
thinking the worst. Still shaking his head, he wandered to the back of the shop and returned from behind the curtain five minutes later with my glasses as good as new. The charge for repair? Ten Rupees (£0.12p). I generously offered twenty in true gratitude but he wouldn't accept my offer! We laughed with them, stiill shaking their heads. That's India.



I don't think we have ever experienced such chaos as met us in the Old City's Chandni Chowk. The ear-numbing roar of cars and lorries, motorised tuktuks and tooting taxis, bikes and scooters, donkey carts and rickshaws, all in as many lanes as it takes to keep the traffic splashing in puddles and every last man fighting for supremacy. At great risk to life and limb we crossed the road into the narrow trafficless streets and bazaars and into the noisy land of scintillating commerce. This is a land of hulabaloo, the jostling crowds all looking and listening amongst the litter and glitter of jewels, the hub-bub amongst the rubble, the rickshaw riders, the porters with sacks and sorters of rubbish, the sneezing of spices that tickle the nose and the nuts and pickles that overflow
Delhi Metro
the sidewalk. Here is the street with peppers and chilllies, tea by the ton, shoes for mum and shoes for the kids, a lane for leather and a lane for cooking, a cycle rickshaw runs over your toes. There's an alley for Bolywood DVDs and another for paper and invites for weddings - and best of all the wholesale fabrics, the colourful crescendo of silk and turbaned Sikh! Utter wonderful chaos! And up above, the crumbling buildings, faded paint and broken shutters, electric cables and telephone wires all in a tangle like grandma's knitting.



For light relief we popped into Karim's for dinner; mutton biryani, brain curry, plain rice, chicken burra, butter naan, another pub with no beer, just across the road from the three marble-domed 17th century Jami Masjid, India's largest mosque.



Further afield and built in more recent times, the Lotus Temple, Baha'i House of Worship, built in 1986, brought our brief affair with Delhi to an end. The Baha'i faith follows the belief of humanity as one single race, the 'Lotus the dream of all cultures' depicted by the 27 magnificent white-marble petals and 9 surrounding pools. Here, followers of all
Chandni Chowk chaos!
faiths may pray and meditate within the peaceful auditorium. A delightful contrast of faith and architecture for us to ponder as we prepare to depart from Delhi.



Tomorrow we plan to move on to Shimla in the foothills of the Himalayas, the summer seat of the Raj. It's a long train journey and we have to catch the 05.20 from Delhi Station, so we'll say good-night for now, and set the alarm for 4am.



For my little brother, Mike's, take on our five-weeks in India, go to: Keep Smiling

Taj Mahal
Our first view
We woke about 5 and were ready by 6 and it was still dark. we were driven then took a rickshaw to the entrance, and queued, the ladies in one line the men in another, nationals and foreigners in separate queues. We waited but were not allowed in until 6.35 by which time the sun was coming up. Some people got in the wrong but shorter queue which was annoying however eventually we got through the security and had our first glimpse of the front of the Taj through an archway. It was breathtaking and as we got closer it became even more incredible. The Taj Mahal is simply the most beautiful building we have ever seen. The morning dew was still on the grass and the mist rose on the banks of the river. There was the faint sounds of musical instruments being played coming from the temple across the river and birdsong could be heard above that. This incredibly beautiful palace was built in 1639 for a much loved wife of the Shah, and is made of white marble inlaid with malachite, coraleon, mother of pearl and other semi precious stones. Inside only the tomb of the Shah and
Us at the Taj
his wife remain. We walked in our covered shoes around the palace and often we were on our own just soaking in the majesty of the place, can't imagine Steve would build something like this for me, it must have cost a fortune and had over 20,000 workers for 13 years. We feel privileged just to be here and so must others as the smiles on many faces were seen everywhere. People talked to us and wanted us in their pictures. We bade a reluctant farewell and made our way back to the hotel had a yummy Indian breakfast and packed and left.
We were taken to Fatehpur Sikri another red fortress which was built by a King that wanted peace and harmony. He decorated the temples with Hindu Christian and Buddhist designs so that all would feel comfortable there. He had three wives a Christian wife from Goa, a Hindu and a Buddhist wife. His bed was built on a huge platform and apart from his wives he had many opportunities with other beautiful ladies that were housed in the fort/palace.He liked to pray but the town became too noisy and busy so he sent everyone away by making

the water disappear or so we were told. Water was so important not just for the normal things in life but they had a water device that cooled the palace in the summer.We continued with our journey to Jaipur a distance of 250kilometres under the careful driving skills of ""Harry"". Probably not his real name but it is easy to pronounce and anyway it suits him. The drive was through a flat landscape with a mixture of different cereals being grown and local farmers making their journeys by camel which seems to be a popular form of transport. As Harry said 'early Indian taxi', today's equivalent is faster but with Indian driving, a lot more dangerous. We stopped briefly for lunch and after 2hours found ourselves winding into Jaipur which is the capital of Rajastan. Not the loveliest of places, still the hotel was good, the pool warm and the restaurant we visited in the evening excellent. Before this we were treated to a puppet show in the gardens, expecting a reasonable sized audience it was only me and Pauline. Three lads were conducting the show, a little naff but amusing, the icing was their attempt to sell as some

puppets. we explained our incompetence at even tying up our shoelaces let alone manoeuvring a puppet so with a small payment 100 rupees as a thankyou for the show we departed to the restaurant for our third curry of the day. Really getting into the Indian way of life.

Train ride to Agra: Taj Mahal







We woke up after a good night sleep occasionally being interrupted by street dogs barking and barking. We were out the door early to catch the 7am train to Agra from Delhi. We organized with our hotel to drop us off at the south train stations. It was a little bit expensive considering it was not far, but we preferred the security of knowing a taxi will be there early than having to look for one.







I was excited to be on my first train ride and so was taking pictures of the train station surroundings and exploring a bit the station before the train left. I got some chai and a few snacks and water as well. We had second class seats so we found our seats, Kyle put our baggage overhead and strapped them in so that they could not be. The train ride was about 5 hours and the train left one hour late. We arrived to Agra around noon.







As soon as we stepped in he train we were surrounded by locals for the trip. Some sitting others standing through all the trip. Kyle baptized me on my first Indian train ride with a cup of chai from a passing vendor. We arrived in Agra at 12pm. Kyle found a very good site to check the train status at raildb.com and so we could see whether the train was late or on time.







When we got to Agra around noon we were surrounded by tuktuk and taxis our way through them to the prepaid booth. As we had paid for the taxi an older local man went with us and offered for 600Ruppees to be our guide to see sights for the day. His name was Munu and he had had a book full of written letters from previous tourists. We first went and got our hotel, which was a 5 min walk from the Taj Mahal and the hotel rooftop restaurant and incidentally our room had views of the Taj.. It was a kind of modern hotel and out room was the only one on the top and it had a rounded bed. It was quite cool!







We started our tour with Munu and his driver to the mini Taj. It was built 20 years prior and the Taj Mahal was based on the same concept and style, just on a larger more ornate scale. We went into the grounds which featured the white marble building in the middle of a garden grounds surrounded by red sandstone walls. We wandered into the grounds, going along the outside, and climbing up the wall to its corner tower. The entire building was white marble with intricate and symmetrical designs all over. The designs were largely floral, but no two sections were identical. Inside was four tomb-like rooms on the corners and four larger entrances or hallways connecting them. I was in fairy tale heaven! It was like a princess castle so white, so beautiful so surreal!! If this was the baby Taj I could not imagine how the real Taj Mahal was!







We then were driven to Agra Fort across the river. The fort was huge and full of different palaces built by different kings. We walk up the main ramp into the fort. Apparently the military occupied parts of the fort. It's rather difficult to describe the interiors of the forts because of so much history and details. The first two areas we visited were large open pruned gardens with a few resident macaques in one corner. There were lines of planted annuals and grass lawns. At the end was what looked like a white mosque but was closed to public. On the riverside the fort was more a maze of corridors, stairs leading to various rooms, temples, palaces, viewpoints, and courtyards. The next area was a viewpoint across the river to the Taj Mahal, with many varieties of birds flying around There were a few palaces and many other viewpoints as we headed from the northerly side to the south. In the southernmost side, the buildings were mostly ruins.







We headed out, found Munu and asked him to take us first to the hotel as I wasn´t feeling so good and had very bad stomach cramps. I quickly went to our room and headed straight to the bathroom and everything from snacks to the previous night dinner and chai came out both ways (sorry for the details). I took a quick shower and took some traveler´s diarrea and vomiting medicine and we headed out to a 'cheap local' restaurant for lunch, that was neither cheap nor local and it certainly was not good food and it was mainly for tourists. So disappointed! . Afterwards he took us to what was like a touristic trap place where they carved marble. The man showed us some workers doing inlays into marble that would be sold as souvenirs. He then eagerly showed us his store and we ended up buying a couple of immature Taj Mahals made of alabaster for 200 after it was originally 800. I played the ¨poor teacher backpacker attitude and so the man said ok and sold both Taj´s for 200 rupees each. <br style=""mso-special-character: line-break;"" />



The next commissioned shop was in a jewelry store but neither of us was interested and even though the stones and jewels were beautiful we just weren´r interested enough and not completely sure they were authentic.







Finally we headed to the Taj Mahal, I was feeling much better, thanks God for the traveller´s diarrhea pill and was eager and happy to see the magnificent Taj Mahal!. We walked to the Eastern Gate of the Taj and there was a serious and a little over the top security check. They went through all our bags, checked inside everything and threw away all food and even tried to throw away a deck of unopened playing cards. I noticed that there was a signed by the entrance that said that the area was 0% pollution free! WOW ! We were in and the first area led to a very large red sandstone gate, and all around we're the red walls. We entered the main area and there it was, the Taj Mahal, with a couple of long waterways leading up to it giving that typical tourist 'Taj Mahal' photo taken by anyone who has been there. I simply could not believe what my eyes were seeing! It was majestic, beautiful, breathtaking! It really felt like being part of a fairy tale. All I could say was WOW WOW WOW!!!. We waited our turn to take different shots including one of me jumping of excitement o see the Taj. Then walked closer taking shots from different angles as we got nearer. People were split into the ""High Importance People"" (read: foreigner) and ""Low Importance People"" (read: Indian). lines going different ways up to the Taj. It may sound classist , but the price fee for foreigners is about double or triple the fee Indians pay. So we deserved our shorter and better line. The Taj Mahal was a majestic piece of architecture widely thought of as the most beautiful building in the world. It's made of white marble with symmetrical carved inlays all over. Again no two sections were identical, and there was precision with its symmetry and geometric shapes and floral designs. On each of the four corners stood a tall minaret with the middle being the main building. Inside the Taj Mahal was the tomb of the wife of the king that built the Taj Mahal as a tomb for his favorite wife. When we went out, the sun was starting to set so we walked around the building taking photos of the Taj and the sunset. Once it was getting dark, the soldiers with assault rifles started to round people up to kick them out of the grounds. We left quickly after sunset. It was absolutely the OST BEAUTIFUL MAJESTIC PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN! And for me , being a dreamer, and a romantic at heart meant to so much to see it with the person I am in love , my friend, my partner my love: Kyle Hughes!

Proof that we were there!
When our train pulled into the Agra station around 6:00 p.m., a rickshaw driver associated with the Pyrenees Homestay, which we’d booked through e-mail, was there waiting for us. He was very friendly and talkative during the ride, pointing out different sights as we passed them and asking us about ourselves, but when we reached our destination, which we were surprised to find was inconveniently located far from the Taj Mahal or Agra Fort, things began to take a turn for the worst.

The owner, with whom I’d been exchanging pleasant e-mails over the past few days, was out, and his stand-in, a young guy with a serious attitude, was working the front desk instead. He immediately teamed up with our driver to pester us about hiring a rickshaw for a day, and, despite our efforts to fill out the necessary check-in paperwork and get settled in, the driver proved to be relentless. We were then informed that the homestay had overbooked and that we’d have to stay in a filthy, ground floor, mosquito infested dump of a room. Dissatisfied, we asked if there were any other, cleaner rooms available with fewer mosquitoes, to which the clerk (who had apparently
Taj Mahal Gate
been holding out on us) replied that there was in fact an upstairs room we could look at. It, however, turned out to be no better than the downstairs room. All the while, the clerk maintained an unpleasant demeanor and the driver continued to linger in the lobby asking us every 5 minutes if we’d decided whether or not to hire him for half a day for 500 rupees – he’d chosen to ignore our frequent requests for time to think about it or discuss it later.

After a bit of deliberation, we made the executive decision to move to a well-reviewed hotel with a rooftop view of the Taj Mahal in the tourist district. At this point, the owner, with whom I’d been e-mailing, showed up and was extremely apologetic for both our treatment and the condition of the room we’d been assigned. He offered us a discount to stay, but I was covered in mosquito bites at this point and simply couldn’t handle the filth. The owner was very understanding and arranged a rickshaw to take us to our new destination, the Kamal Hotel. We took the rickshaw to the Taj Ganj area, situated nearAgra’s major sights,
Taj Mahal
and checked into our exponentially nicer, though pricier, room. The receptionist there was charismatic and happy to help us, providing us a map of the city and marking out a logical route for sightseeing without any attempt to sell us a tour through the hotel.

That night, we ate dinner (and several meals after that) at a cute, tiny little place recommended in our guidebook called Joney’s Place, which was established in the ‘70s and is still going strong. Its walls were covered with signatures, comments, and passport photos, along with amateur drawings of the Taj, left by patrons passing through over the years. If you visit the restaurant and sit in the back left booth, you may be able to find the message Scott and I left. J

Although our plan was to wake up at dawn to visit the Taj, since that’s supposed to be the best time to go in order to catch the sunrise and avoid the crowds (if only slightly), we ended up at the hospital instead because Scott’s sinus problems had continued to worsen. This visit actually went much more smoothly than mine, and we were in and out of there in
Just inside the gate
less than an hour, including the time it took for Scott to get a precautionary chest x-ray, which came back clear. We were even able to get all of his medications at the hospital, and our total bill was significantly cheaper than mine inKochi. Since we’d decided to hold off on sightseeing that day, we booked another night inAgrato ensure us enough time to see everything and to allow Scott some time to recover. We ate dinner at Joney’s Place again, where we noticed two adorable cats scampering beneath the tables, which made us miss our little Zooey-kins.

We awoke the following morning at 5:00 a.m. to make it to the Taj for sunrise. We got out the door a little after 6:00, and, since sunrise was scheduled for 6:40 and the Taj was a short walk away, we figured we had plenty of time. Unfortunately, the ticket line was pretty long, even at this hour, and moved rather slowly, not to mention they didn’t even open the gates until 6:35 ish. We still managed to get inside in time to get lots of good pictures, although I had to enter ahead of Scott because the guards wouldn’t allow
Scott being artistic and succeeding
us to take our tiny tripod (which we weren’t even aware we’d packed) inside, so he had to rush it over to be stored in a locker 200 meters from the entrance. When I got inside the gate, I saw several people toting large tripods, however, which was confusing…Perhaps they were professional photographers who had paid for permits, but I couldn’t be sure.

We spent about two hours on the grounds admiring the majestic, beautifully crafted structure from the inside and out and taking tons of pictures in the process. It truly is an amazing building, and we were glad to have decided to visit it after all. A bit of history regarding the Taj Mahal…Contrary to my previous assumption, the building, constructed by an estimated 20,000 men over the course of 21 years and completed in 1653, was never intended to be used as a palace or, despite its Islamic theme, a mosque. It was actually erected by the emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum and monument of love dedicated to his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who passed away shortly after giving birth to her fourteenth child. I was shocked to learn that when Shah Jahan’s son came
Taj Mahal at sunrise
to power, soon after the Taj Mahal’s completion, he imprisoned his father for the remainder of his life, depriving him of visiting his late wife at her final resting place. Upon his death in 1666, Shah Jahan’s body was carried to the mausoleum, where his tomb was placed next to that of his beloved. Interesting fact: every part of the Taj Mahal was built in perfect symmetry, but, since Mumtaz Mahal’s tomb lies in the center of the mausoleum’s interior, Shah Jahan’s tomb, located to her left, breaks that symmetry. This in no way affects the sheer magnificence of the structure, however.

Upon leaving, Scott and I stopped at a local sweet shop and bought some ofAgra’s famous petha candy made from crystallized pumpkin. Though tasty, it was extremely sugary and tasted nothing like pumpkin. It had an interesting texture, in that it was crunchy and dry on the outside, but had the consistency of saturated gelatin (similar to Turkish delight) on the inside. We bought a box for 40 rupees (less than $1) since nowhere was selling individual pieces, but after one or two pieces each, we couldn’t handle the sugar and had lost a taste for the
Fountain view
stuff.

After our visit, we headed to – guess where! – Joney’s for breakfast, then took a rickshaw to Agra Fort. This predominantly sandstone citadel was constructed between 1565 and 1573 as a stronghold for Emperor Akbar and, later, his grandson, Shah Jahan’s Mughal Empire. This large, ancient complex was impressive and had several interesting areas, but it didn’t quite measure up to the Taj Mahal – and we became quickly annoyed with guides who wouldn’t take no for an answer when trying to get us to hire them as well as strangers who incessantly attempted to “discreetly” photograph us as we passed them. Despite these minor frustrations, we did spend a good deal of time exploring the fort and enjoyed seeing the sights there.

Following the fort, we headed to the nearby Kinari Bazaar to check out the Jama Masjid mosque and get some lunch. The mosque was positioned right in the middle of the bazaar’s hustle and bustle (i.e. high decibel mass chaos) and was literally surrounded on all sides by shops and stalls – so much so that we had to make an entire loop around it, pushing our way past rickshaw drivers, motorcyclists, and
As the sun is rising
people trying to sell us things, just to find the entrance. After ascending the stairs to the mosque’s large open square, we were instructed to remove our shoes before proceeding. This wouldn’t have been so bad if it hadn’t been an open-air structure with pigeon feces blanketing the ground. Though impressive on the outside, the place was a bit underwhelming inside, so our stay was brief. We left and walked across the street for lunch at Chimman Lal Puri Wale for one of its famous thalis. The food was very good but extremely spicy…Scott and I were total champs and cleaned our plates, though. J The only oddities about the restaurant were that we were seated upstairs in a grimy room away from all the local patrons, and there was a waiter who, while transporting items up and down the stairs, would stop and stare at us for long periods of time.

We spent the remainder of our day hanging out in the hotel room since we were exhausted and Scott wasn’t feeling very well. I took a three hour nap while Scott spent his time more productively and read (which seems to often be the case…). When I
Mosque next to the Taj Mahal
woke up, we headed up to the rooftop to try to catch the Taj at sunset, but we were a little late. Still, we ate dinner at the hotel and enjoyed the nighttime silhouette of the building before returning to our room to pack. Our plan for the next day was to wake up early and take a public bus to the ancient city ofFatehpur Sikri, about an hour and a half away, stay for a few hours, then catch another four-ish hour long bus to Jaipur. We ended up carrying this plan out successfully with only a few minor setbacks, such as our inability to wake up early…but you’ll hear more about that in the next post!

March 5th 2013
Published: April 20th 2013


On the road to Mathura
Unusual sights: A cow being lead along the road - not left to its own devices, and a tuk tuk taxi with only ten people in it - there are usually at least a dozen!
To the south-east of Agra, in the city of Allahabad, a mass protest had begun about pollution of the Yamuna River. For years, industrial waste and sewage has been discharged into this river, the largest tributary of the sacred Ganges, from drains on the outskirts of Delhi far away to the north. It has become officially 'dead' by the time it runs beside the Taj Mahal in Agra. Now the masses were heading up to Delhi on foot to voice their concerns to parliament and doubtless to Delhi's Chief Minister herself, the appropriately-named Mrs Sheila Dikshit.

By 'masses' I do mean masses! What had started off as 10,000 farmers, sadhus, union activists and members of religious and social groups had already swelled to many times that number. Yesterday morning, they blocked the Agra-Delhi highway with parked trucks and started marching the 60 kilometres from Agra to Mathura. They would be joined by Krishna devotees from Vrindavan, just outside Mathura, and it was thought there could be more than 100,000 people in the march when it eventually reaches the capital.

We too were heading for Delhi and planned to visit spiritual Mathura on the way. We had to hope that

the marchers reached Mathura before us.

Fortune smiled on us and we reached Mathura without any problems - just the usual hazards of ambling cows on narrow roads and an occasional lorry coming towards us in our lane on dual carriageways! The protesters had already been, slept and continued their journey, taking the AH1, the old Asian Highway, towards Delhi.

Mathura is the legendary 'birthplace of Lord Krishna' (which translates as 'Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi'😉 and it's a major pilgrimage site. Krishna is the handsome Hindu deity usually shown with blue skin, a yellow dhoti and a peacock feather crown, sometimes standing with one leg bent in front of the other playing a flute. He's often accompanied by cows and a bevy of milkmaids. As the eighth avatar of Vishnu, the Supreme God, he's extremely important.

You may have encountered the Hare Krishna Movement - more properly known as The International Society for Krishna Consciousness or ISKCON for short. They're a cheerful group of people with cleanliness, mercy, austerity and truthfulness as their principles. The Beatles met them on a visit to India in the late-1960s and the hit 'My Sweet Lord' duly followed in 1970 (in the days when songs

weren't songs unless they were at least four minutes long!).

You may have heard the mantra 'Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare'. I certainly have. It, or at least the words 'Hare Krishna', featured in quite a few tracks, not only by members of The Beatles, but numerous other singers throughout the 70s. I've sometimes heard it when calling in for a vegetarian lunch at Bhaktivedanta Manor, ISKCON's UK headquarters, after shopping at Costco's warehouse in rural Hertfordshire. This stately pile and the surrounding farmland was donated to them by the late George Harrison, himself a Krishna devotee, who famously once said: ""All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call"". Incidentally, if you've ever wondered about holy cows, karma and reincarnation, you'll find answers on the Bhaktivedanta website.

Krishna spent his childhood at Vrindavan, mentioned earlier in this blog, and there you'll find the Krishna Balaram Mandir, better known as the ISKCON Temple. Uniquely among the thousands of Vrindavan's temples it's well equipped to deal with accommodation and meals for foreign visitors and consequently attracts Hare

We never see papayas this size in our local supermarket.
Krishna pilgrims from all over the world. The Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna... mantra has been sung loudly there continuously, 24 hours a day, non-stop, for many years!

However, I digress...

Krishna was born in an underground prison. Like most Hindu legends, it's far too complicated for me to even begin to explain what his parents were doing in prison and how Krishna subsequently rose to fame. Sorry.

Anyhow, it's believed that the first temple was constructed here, on the site of that prison, almost 5,000 years ago. In the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi complex, next to the vaguely-interesting Kesava Deo Temple, is a small, solid-brick room rather like a dark, ornately-decorated prison cell. This is revered as the actual birthplace. It has similarities to the grotto at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, believed to be the 'birthplace of Jesus Christ'. It's certainly as glitzy, crowded and claustrophobic.

Krishna, it is said, was fond of milk and milk-based sweets. Perhaps as a result, Mathura has become known for sweet, gooey, brown, cardamom-flavoured, caramelised milk specialities called 'pedas'. They're too sweet even for me and, not to put too fine a point on it, I think they

The Taj Mahal
The white marble came from Makrana in Rajasthan and the red sandstone from Fatehpur Sikri. Precious stones were brought from far-flung places in Tibet, China, Sri Lanka, Persia and Afghanistan.
Agra - grubby, overcrowded, totally tourist-oriented, 'want postcards?', 'need taxi sir?', hassle, hassle...

It’s best to get in, see the sights and get out – as quickly as you can.

Arrive around midday. In the afternoon, visit Agra Fort for a distant view of the Taj Mahal down by the Yamuna River, then the glorious ‘Baby Taj ’ (the tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah), before taking in the sunset view of the Taj Mahal from across the river at Mehtab Bagh. If you still have any energy, complete your day with the Sound & Light performance back at the Red Fort.

Before dawn next day, enjoy the highlight of your visit by joining the queue at the Taj Mahal to see the sun rise over this fabulous monument. It's the best time of day and you'll be able to spend a couple of hours there before it gets too crowded. Just make sure it's not a Friday - the mosque is in constant use and the Taj is closed.

Return to your hotel for a late breakfast, pack your bags and move on.

Perfect!


I don't need to give you the low-down on what there is to see here. There

are more than enough websites and guidebooks extolling the virtues of Agra and its unique and remarkable monuments. When I last checked, there were 1,092 blogs with 11,782 photos right here on TravelBlog alone!

So, instead, click on the website links above or, better still, take a look at my photos. They all have captions and I've tried to say a few words about each of them. You'll only find a few pictures of the Taj Mahal here, however - I've visited this place many times and, regardless of the camera, the lens or the angle, the classic shots of that iconic building always tend to look the same as those on everyone else's blogs.


Accommodation: Working on the maxim of: 'I came, I saw, I conquered - and got the hell out of the place', my advice is not to empty your wallet on accommodation in Agra. You didn’t come here to spend your time in a hotel room, did you?

Of course, if you're a luxury freak, by all means take a room at the Oberoi Amarvilas; including taxes but no breakfast, a night here will set you back around Rs.46,000 (about £555/US$850/€645)! We

preferred to stay at N.Homestay, where a double room (albeit minus the luxury but including breakfast) cost only Rs.1,500 (about £18/US$27.50/€21.50). And that's for two people! What’s not to like about that?

The people who run it, Shiron and his mother are delightful - they’re informal, friendly, speak excellent English, and are very helpful. It's not a hotel, it's a 'homestay' ('bed and breakfast'😉 and rooms have minimal furnishings, but they’re spacious and clean. They each have a private bathroom with shower and wc, and there's free WiFi too. Breakfast in a slightly gloomy dining room is nothing to write home about, but it’s certainly more than adequate. The location, in a quiet road within easy reach of the main sights by taxi or tuk tuk, is good. Also, within walking distance you'll find a Pizza Hut and other eateries with familiar Western names (delivery to N.Homestay is fine) or the lady of the house will cook an Indian veg or non-veg lunch or dinner for you, with prior notice, at a maximum cost of around Rs.350 (£4.25/US$6.50/€5) each.

Asia » India » Uttar Pradesh » Chambal National Sanctuary
March 3rd 2013
Published: April 10th 2013


Fatehpur Sikri
The jali (perforated marble screens) around the late-16th Century tomb of Shaikh Salim Chishti.
A week into our wildlife adventure and we still had another three days to go. What I'd hoped would be a leisurely ten days had so far turned out to be anything but! It had been a hive of activity, involving chilly early mornings and hot, sunny days in the open-air, with much hurtling around in jeeps or bumping along on cycle rickshaws. It had been exhausting, educational and exhilarating in almost equal quantities. Okay, I did get one lazy morning - but, boy, did I need it!

Although a veteran of many places on our itinerary, the last two animal sanctuaries, Ranthambore (Hooray, we heard a tiger roar!) and Keoladeo (A Birder Paradise in Rajasthan?), were entirely new to me. While I won't hurry back to one of these, the other was fantastic!

Now, we were off to a third, the Chambal National Sanctuary, about 125 kilometres to the east of Keoladeo. It's virtually unknown to TravelBloggers. There's only one entry which includes it - and that's only because I've been beaten to it by my travelling companions Grey haired nomads (aka my brother and his wife) - see India 6 - 'Ancient Cities & Life in the Wild' . Mine, the one you're now reading, however, is the only one to have 'Chambal National Sanctuary' as its
Fatehpur Sikri
Location! (Actually, even that's wrong because its proper name is the National Chambal Sanctuary! Ho Hum...)

But first a sentence or ten about a well-known place through which we had to pass on the way - Fatehpur Sikri.

In the second half of the 16th century, the capital of the Mughal empire was right here on the Sikri ridge. It was originally called Fatehabad (Fateh, an Arabic or Persian word referring to military 'victories') and later Fatehpur ('pur', as you'll know if you've read one of my previous blogs, meaning 'city').

Built by the Emperor Akbar, this massive city was 'considerably larger than London and more populous' according to Ralph Fitch, an English traveller who passed this way in 1585. It comprised palaces and public buildings, harems, and residences for the court, the army, royal servants and a huge population. There were mosques too, the largest of which, the Jama Masjid (not to be confused with one of the same name in Delhi), was designed to accommodate 10,000 faithful and, according to the dedicatory inscription, deserved no less respect than Mecca itself.

The city's architecture is impressive and, perhaps more importantly, it's perfectly preserved for, although
Fatehpur Sikri
completed in 1573, it was only lived in for a dozen or so years before being abandoned. It was a bit like the thousand-piece jigsaw you bought at a charity shop. You had a place to put it and you had a picture of what it would look like. You spent ages putting it together and started to enjoy it. Then, just as it was more or less finished, you discovered there was one tiny piece missing! In this case, the Emperor's capital without a future was beautifully built in the right place to govern an empire - but there wasn't enough water to sustain the Emperor or his thousands of subjects!

Akbar's loss is our gain. It's a wonderful example of a city preserved in time.


And so we continued, getting a bit delayed after taking a wrong turn somewhere on the Agra ring-road, towards the Chambal River, part of the Gangetic drainage system and a tributary of the Yamuna (the river which runs beside the Taj Mahal).

The sanctuary, in existence since 1979, is situated near where the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh meet, and is co-administered by all three states.
On the Chambal River

It covers a large area where the Chambal River cuts through ravines and hills to create a long and narrow eco-reserve, about 450 kilometres long and two to six kilometres wide. It was established primarily to protect critically-endangered small crocodiles called Gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) and it now supports the largest population of this creature in the wild. It's one of the cleanest rivers in India, one of very few places where you might be lucky enough to see the rare Ganges River Dolphin and the endangered Red Crowned Roof Turtle, and the only place where Indian Skimmers are known to nest in large numbers. It certainly is a very special place.

High on our list of things to do was a boat ride on the Chambal River. Now this wasn't to be any old boat ride. We needed a guide and he came in the shape of Gajendra Dagar, a young naturalist provided to us by our hotel. He proved to be a brilliant spotter, extremely knowledgeable and very pleasant to be with. In the space of a few hours, he found us an array of spectacular and rare birds, several of the long-snouted Gharials, Mugger (or Marsh) Crocodiles,
Gharial
some Turtles and a Jackal. There was also a Jungle Cat somewhere just above the river bank, although I would have needed better eyesight or binoculars to see it. Alas, there were no sightings of freshwater dolphins or the endangered turtle.

In the grounds of our hotel and among their adjoining farmland, we were introduced to a wide variety of smaller birds and some owls. Returning from an excursion to nearby temples, we encountered a pair of mongoose moving fast through the undergrowth just outside the hotel entrance. That night, in the gardens, by torchlight, Janice had a glimpse of a palm civet (a small tree-dwelling wild cat - similar to those that, in Indonesia, are responsible for Kopi Luwak, coffee made from the part-digested beans found in its droppings, yummy!).

In the mornings, I was woken at some unearthly hour by a colony of Fruit Bats, some with their stretchy black wings wrapped tightly around themselves, others showing their ginger, fox-like faces. As the sun set on the previous evening, these giant, web-winged mammals had swirled around like dragons before leaving their roost in the tall tree overhanging my bungalow. You simply would not believe the amount

of noise involved when they returned after their night's feeding foray and emptied themselves onto my roof!

A downside to staying for a few days amid this truly wondrous area is the lack of good accommodation. Perhaps you could stay in Agra, about 70 kilometres away, and visit it on a day trip or try to find a way to book a room at one of the government Forest Rest Houses or Public Works Department Inspection Bungalows at Bah, Chakkar Nagar or Pinahat. Failing that, you'd have little option but to stay where we did, at what's called Chambal Safari Lodge. The name suggests that, like others elsewhere in the world (I'm thinking East Africa, Australia, Thailand even), this might be a smart, lodge-style hotel close to all the action. Wrong! This one's a former farm with fields and arid scrub around it and the journey to or from the river sanctuary, through small towns with narrow streets, markets and traffic could take three-quarters of an hour each way. It's run (not very well) by an eminent Indian couple, who usually live in south-west London and who, although well-meaning and pleasant, seemed lacking in good hotel management skills. There's
In the village
no competition in the vicinity, so it's grossly over-priced too. A pity really, although we didn't let its shortcomings spoil our enjoyment of the wildlife in this unique environment.

We also enjoyed visiting a neighbouring village, where we met welcoming, smiling people eager to show us how they lived, where they cooked, where they slept. This was a true rural community of subsistence farmers living in tiny home-made houses of mud and brick. Many had a buffalo or two tied up outside to provide the family with nutritious milk and cheese, as well as fuel handmade from the copious dung. Villagers congregated around a communal standpipe to fill plastic containers with water. Girls in smart blue and white uniforms, their hair neatly-tied in loops, made their way to school. Boys bunked off school to play cricket on dusty, bare ground at the edge of the village. Dogs languished in the shade and bright-eyed small children proudly carried puppies to show us. It was a charming interlude which gave us a glimpse of a life that's lead by so many in this land and so seldom seen by visitors from the developed world.

A short drive from the 'lodge'
Bateshwar
brought us to a remarkable complex of ancient white temples and shrines grouped along one bank of the Yamuna River at Bateshwar. This important spiritual and cultural centre contains more than a hundred edifices to the glory of the Hindu deity Shiva, the 'auspicious one', the Supreme God. Inside some, bare-footed worshippers and visitors alike had to step with care as many large bees littered the floor, attracted by flowers and sweetmeats offered to the 'lingam' semblance of the deity.

Brave youngsters swimming in the fast-flowing river, a sari-clad woman washing her clothes, priests and monkeys, bells ringing out, little stalls selling all manner of food and temple offerings, a hijra (a eunuch) in conversation with sadhus (ascetics/holy men) and the smouldering remains of a cremation on the river bank visited by a wandering dog all reminded us that this was very much a living place. A colourful, fascinating, busy, living place.


Accommodation: We spent three nights at Chambal Safari Lodge. I can do no better than refer you to my TripAdvisor review, an extract from which reads: (quote) ‘Great for birds’ is all that I wrote in the hotel's guest book. I resisted the temptation to
Chambal Safari Lodge
Attractive from the outside.
add: ‘Not so great for humans’. (unquote)

We spent Rs.5,500 plus taxes (about £75/US$115/€87) per night per double bungalow (all paid in advance) and another Rs.1500 + taxes (about £22/US$33/€25) per person per night for breakfast, lunch and dinner. For a price tag that was more than hefty by Indian standards, we expected better things all round - it was two-star accommodation, food and service at five-star prices. And where, I wonder, was the friendly, welcoming atmosphere?

From Hamburg, Germany, to Agra, India
Hamburg - Frankfurt - Delhi - Agra


Taj Mahal I
View of it from the other side of the river at sunset.
I have come out of hibernation and there are new stories and adventures coming up. At the moment, I am in Agra, India, the city where the famous Taj Mahal is located. I am on a two and a half week trip through Rajasthan with my friend Mizzi. We only arrived here the day before yesterday, but it already feels like weeks because so much has happened.

We left Hamburg on Thursday and flew from there through Frankfurt into Delhi. Apart from the fact that our taxi to the airport in Hamburg was late and we were a bit stressed out when we got there, the journey went smooth. We arrived at Delhi international airport on Friday morning at 1:15 am. Delhi is time zone UTC +5.5.

We had arranged a pickup with our hotel and found our driver right away when we got out of the airport. The hotel was supposed to be close to the airport, but the journey seemed to take forever because we had to go all the way around the aiport and apart from that we had the feeling that we were going back and forth. I always get this feeling here when the

drivers take us from one place to the other, by the way. Anyway, we had a fixed rate, and finally we got to the hotel. It was far past 3 am when we finally got to bed.

After breakfast the next morning, we were taken to another hotel closer to the city centre. Due to traffic jams, it took us over an hour to get there, although it was only a distance of 16 km. And the Indians drive like crazy, they always find a gap through which they can squeeze their car, and they blow their horn to say: hello, I'm coming, please move to the side. Amazing, glad I don't have to drive here myself.

As we had booked a hotel in Agra and then a tour from Agra onwards, we would have to leave Delhi the next day. Thus, we tried to buy train tickets to Agra through the hotel personnel, who turned out not to have a clue how to buy the tickets. But for some reason, they did not tell ys that they did not know. After a few attempts, we decided to try it ourselves.

We caught the nearby metro to

the main station and first wanted to find the official tourist office, but could not find one. Then we tried to find a ticket counter where we could get a train ticket, but were not successful in it either. There were touts all about, everyone asking us what we wanted and where we wanted to go and offering help, but we were absolutely sure that we would run straight into a scam. Finally, someone of the security staff told us to catch a motor rikshaw and go to an office at Connaught Square. I did not have a good feeling when we entered it, but we could not find another tourism office, and the one there at least claimed to be accredited by the government.

The guy there told us that no tickets to Agra were available for the next morning and offered us private transport to Agra for far too much money. We were running out of time and did not have a choice, so we accepted. Later on, we learned that it is really difficult to book a train ticket. At least for the classes that are suitable for a Western tourist. You have to do it

a long time in advance, and doing it online is a real hassle with a lot of steps in between. A guy from Australia told us that it had taken him about 15 hours altogether to get the train tickets online in advance. After hearing that, we did not feel all that stupid any more. The guy in the tourism office asked us what else we had planed, and we told him that we wanted to go to Agra and had booked a tour from there to a national park and then to Jaipur. He offered us a Rajasthan tour from there onwards, including all the places we found interesting for a really good price. So even though we knew he had pulled us over the barrel with the trip to Agra, we booked the other tour because we did not want to go through all this again after arriving in Jaipur.

We left the office totally exhausted and not very happy, but then had a very nice late afternoon lunch and caught the metro back to our hotel. We spent the rest of the evening just relaxing and had dinner at our hotel.

Our driver arrived almost

15 minutes early the next morning. The 200 km trip took us almost six hours. There are so many traffic jams, it is just incredible. Plus, there was a rally going from Mathura (150 km south of Delhi) to Delhi. People were protesting against the pollution of the Yamuna river. This meant that two lanes of the highway were blocked and the cars going north were on our two lanes.

Initially, we thought our driver was really nice and easy going, but when approacing Agra, he tried to talk us into going to some marble shop. We had to tell him several times and in a very decided manner that we wanted to go straight to our hotel. He tried to convince us of hiring him for the rest of the day or even the next day, and again it took us a while to point out to him that we did not want this. We gave him a tip of the amount some of the other tourists we had met had recommended to us: 70 rupees, about 1 Euro, because the tourists had told us that they don't earn more than 3 dollars per day. But he said

this was very little. We asked him how much would be appropriate, and then gave him 500 rupees (about 7 Euros). Then he wanted this amount from each of us. But we said no. We asked again in the hotel, and there we were told that 500 rupees was okay. Or even more or less, depending how happy we were with the driver. Oh well, no clear information...

Anyway, the evening was nice. Our hotel is within walking distance from the east gate to the Taj Mahal, and from the roof terrace, we can see the impressive monument. It is shining white and looks almost like a Fata Morgana. Incredibly beautiful. We had our lunch with this wonderful view. We bumped into an Autralian couple who had arranged a tour to the other side of the river, from where the Taj Mahal was said to look particularly beautiful at sunset. They invited us to come along, and so we did.

And indeed, it was a wonderful evening. The Taj Mahal really shines, it is so white, you can hardly believe it. The arrangement of the four minarets around its dome is just perfect. While the sun was sinking,

it kept changing its colour. We were happy and concluded the day with a very nice Indian dinner and a glass of wine.

This morning, we got up at 5:50 am to see the Taj Mahal at sunrise. We entered trough the nearby east gate and walked around the building and into it. It is a tomb the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan had built for his favourite wife in 1632. To its east and west side, there are two mosques.

We spent quite a bit of time there, then walked over to the nearby Red Fort. It was built in the 16th century, but before that, there had already been a fort there dating from the 11th century. As the name already tells you, the fort is made of red stone, and it is massive, with a moat and two walls surrounding it. From one of these walls, you also have a nice view of the Taj Mahal.

Afterwards, we caught a motor rikshaw to I'timad-ud-Daulah, the tomb of a former Wazir (chief minister) of the Mughal emperor Akbar. It is of course smaller than the Taj Mahal, but also very ornate and beautiful. Finally, we did

some shopping. We love the Indian dresses and wanted to get some for ourselves.

We had another late lunch on the rooftop terrace of our hotel and decided to spend the rest of the day just relaxing, enjoying the view of the Taj Mahal and reading. Tomorrow morning, we will be picked up here for a tour to Ranthambore National Park. I will let you know how this went!

Last day in Varkala
So after Davy got sick and a little better again, we had only one last day to spend in lovely Varkala. After everything that has happened in last few days, I'm taking back all my objections against Varkala (such as prices cos it got even worse in Delhi and Agra and the hassle about everything as well) and we will definitely be coming back there. We enjoyed the warmest day of our stay, the warmest sea, the nicest dinner and what was amazing, when we were in the water swimming, a tiny black and white fish started swimming around Davy, probably attracted by his shorts of the same colour and stayed swimming around Davy for maybe 2 hours. We said goodbye to our puppies and got ready for the north of India.

It was a very long two day journey from south to north. Getting a taxi from Varkala to Trivandrum airport, Davy getting his dodgy tummy again (thanks Angela for that expression 😉, flying from Trivandrum to Delhi with a Mumbai stopover, having like 8 hours to spend in Delhi and taking an overnight train to Ramnagar, waiting another few hours and getting a bus to Sult Mahadev. Delhi,

from the very first second, is the craziest place ever, so busy, so dirty, so noisy, so many poor people sleeping everywhere, begging children... We decided to see a bit of the town and got an expensive tuk-tuk to drive us around for a few hours. We pretty much made it only to the Delhi gate. That was cool, all enlighted, we got a warm chai and took a few pictures and wanted to go and see other places but our tuk-tuk driver said everything was closed and too far away and it was too late and he had all the excuses so we went to see the gate again and then I think as a punishment we wanted to see more, he drove as back to the train station on a main motorway and it was so polluted and we could hardly breath and got stuck in the evening traffic jam and just couldn't wait to leave Delhi.

We found our first overnight train and got the worst beds close to the exit door and it was absolutely freezing as people kept them opened all the time and close to the toilets so it stunk and you can't

imagine how terribly Indian toilets can smell. Then when trying to sort out on which bed to sleep as I'm a wuss and I'm scared of sleeping on the top beds and falling down, I saw this guy leaving the toilet with his pants opened and his dick hanging out and then I completely freaked out and refused to fall asleep on the train. Very very early of the following morning we arrived to Ramnagar and it was sooo cold. Indu's cousin Shyamu was waiting for us and took us to his home and kindly let us stay there to have a rest and we met his amazing sons. They were two and three and were crazily hyperactive at five in the morning, running around with lollies we gave them and touching everything with the lollies so leaving everything extra sticky. Then we were brought to a bus station and had bus tickets bought from Shyamu's family and it was so nice of them to take care of us. We knew the bus drive would involve lots of hills but our imagination was far away from the reality. We had seats right beside the driver so we had a great

view of the narrow muddy path with its crazy turns, cliffs and it was really scary drive and I was actually praying so we would survive without falling over the mountain cliff edge. Despite of being scared to death, we already knew we loved this place with its high mountains and pretty landscape and wheat fields looking like paddy fields and we saw our first monkey on the way up.

When we reached a mountain village Sult Mahadev, we finally saw Indu waiting for us and that's when the absolutely best part of our stay in India started. Indu's brother Puran and his wife Laksmi donated a bell to a local Siva temple and we were invited for the donation ceremony. It was a lovely tiny temple and we were present for the whole ritual, we got our Tika blessing and we were able to be part of the ceremony not as tourists but as a part of the whole community and it was amazing. You would imagine that such a ceremony is a quiet and sacred when only the priest is performing the blessings and readings and sacrifices but this was very intimate and all the people involved

were interrupting the priest and shouting at each other and it was kinda messy but very magical and very spiritual. There was a small reception after the ceremony and lots of people from the village came to have a look and we met lots of lovely people and were running around with Puran's children Vishal and Priya and every second of that day felt very special. The village was surrounded by high mountains and we still didn't know that it's not our final destination. Later in the afternoon, some of the people started to be nervous that they should go home and feed their cows. That's when we realized we still had a good walk ahead us. Actually not a walk but proper treck up the mountain and as we were walking, Indu pointed out on a few white houses on the top of the mountain and that was our final destination, her native village Reetha. The climb up itself was an amazing experience, some of the people took our bags as we wouldn't be able to bring them up and we stopped in every village because all the people know each other and are amazingly friendly and in every

place we got something yummy, chai, lassi, sweets... And the higher we were getting, the more amazing view was arising in front of us and you could feel the peace of this place. It took us maybe another two hours to reach Reetha and finally we were there. On the top of the mountain and completely out of this world. I was joking that after this, we could just go home because we can't experience anything better than this during our travels. We stayed with Indu's parents for 3 days and they are lovely people and it was very touching to see how they live. So modestly but in such a harmony with the world around, so friendly and welcoming. We ate with them in this tiny kitchen and it was amazing to see Davy eating things he would never ever touch before in Ireland and he wanted more and everything we had was so tasty, home made rice pudding with home made ghee, home made chapattis and curries. The only tough one was when they wanted to make something special and got a hen for us. What we didn't know they would just cut the whole hen into pieces
Sick on the beach
and cook everything so we got this broth with hen pieces which were like bones and organs and the good thing was the kitchen didn't have much light so we couldn't really see what we were eating 😊 The best part was yet to come. We went for a day trip to Devi (pronounced as Davy 😊 temple and were drinking chai with the priest in his kitchen (prepared by Indu) and I'm not sure how that happened, they made Davy to start putting red bangles onto my wrists and all the people were laughing at him that he will have to marry me no matter what now. And as the priest had a good laugh out of that as well, he decided to go further with the wedding ceremony and gave me a wedding chunni and we exchanged flower garlands with Davy and kissed and the priest put his hands on our backs and that was pretty much it. We are married. At least here, in this special place out of the real world 😊 We had an absolute blast in the mountains, Priya and Vishal running around shouting uncle...auntie... all the time, trying to take pictures with our
DSC_0408
camera and playing with Davy's iphone and Indu's parents have the cuttest puppy ever and we just wished we could stay for much longer.

Puran and his family were invited to a wedding so we got the opportunity to join them and see real Indian wedding. Had to take the crazy bus down the mountains again to much colder Ramnagar and quickly buy some new clothes as everything we had was filthy at this stage of our trip. Then we experienced our first drive on the back seat of a tuk-tuk, facing the road, holding a bar so we wouldn't fall out and being in the middle of the madness. It was freezing and it was great. We were driving for ages and then we saw this noisy parade with lights, loud music, people dancing and that was the wedding. The groom was sitting on a chariot and on the way from his house to the bride's house so we joined the parade and felt instantly bad as all the attention of all the people turned from the groom towards us. Everyone was waving and everyone wanted to take a picture of us and we thought that maybe we
DSC_0453
should rather leave not to spoil the wedding completely. The wedding itself was a little bit strange, people didn't really care about the groom and by the time the bride arrived, everyone was dispersed at dinning tables and munching their dinners. The groom and the bride had to spend hours just posing for a camera with lots of different people, including us as we were forced to join them at the stage, during some ritual, and pose with them for the pics. It's hard to describe how it feels to be in the middle of the attention of all the people, a little intimidating and awesome at the same time. Davy definitely loved it, he said he felt like a movie star and it was amazing to be part of the real Indian wedding.

Nothing can stay perfect and the next day, anothe dodgy tummy changed our plans. We were supposed to go with Indu to Nainital for the day but Davy felt sick again so we had to cancel it and decided to come back to Delhi together with Puran's family. Waiting for a local train, Davy got better but I got really bad fever and it was
DSC_0482
an absolute nightmare to be waiting hours for a train. Everyone at the Kashipur train station was starring at us and everytime we moved somewhere less crowded, it didn't take long for the crowds to make a new circle around us. Two different trains and pretty much the whole day, it took to get from the north back to Delhi and as Indu agreed to join us for an Agra trip the following day we decided to stay in a hotel close to train station. Ridiculously they refused to let her check-in as Indu had only her ID and not her passport, so wrecked after the journey, sick, tired, we spend another hour or more trying to persuade them to let us stay. We had to get up at 5:30 of the following morning and I still felt sick and we rushed to the train station and then I lost the train ticket... thank God Indu ran back and found it and we sat down for 3 hour journey from Delhi to Agra to see the famous Taj Mahal. As soon as we got out the train in Agra, it started raining and by the time we reached Taj Mahal
DSC_0530
it was lashing maybe even worse than it does in Ireland. The way I always imagined Taj Mahal is this huge huge beautiful building... the rain probably did its job but it looked tiny. Very cute. But tiny 😊 As it was pissing raining, we took just a few quick pictures, the only cool thing about it was, that we have pretty much pictures free of the usual crowds and got completely drenched. Indu had to leave to catch her train back to Delhi and her flight back to Pune, which she actually missed as all the trains were delayed because the whole north of India was flooded. We quickly ran through the inside of the Taj Mahal, yeah you guess correctly, took a few quick pictures and got into our taxi and instead to other sightseeing places, we asked our driver and our guide to take us to a shop so we could buy something new and clean and mainly dry! And of course, this is India, so they were driving us around into touristy shops so they could get their commission, like leather shop with belts, marble shop with stuff and it took a good few hours until
Davy stealing my thali in Delhi
we got our new clothes and could change into something dry. And finally a dinner in a touristy restaurant, the highest bill of our Indian stay and a ""nice"" souvenir in a form of a dodgy tummy for me.

Then we had to wait for a train from Agra to Mathura, which was delayed because of the rain and then we thought we were going to miss our train from Mathura to Varanasi, but that one was luckily delayed as well. It meant lots of waiting at the train stations, freezing cold, lots and lots of poor people sleeping on the ground, cows and monkeys on the platforms and no need to be repeating that it was stinking out there as pretty much the whole train station is one big toilet. We found our train to Varanasi and our beds and got ready for an overnight 14 hour journey and Davy fell asleep and I think it was the first time ever I actually hated India and wanted to go home. It was stinking in there, it was cold, I was sick and then a mouse ran over our bags.

Getting closer to Varanasi, everything looked better again,
Rajghat in Delhi
we were enjoying the trip, watching people living along the railways in muddy houses, dirty children running around, brick factories and mustard seed plants fields and it was getting warmer and sunny again. The moment we arrived to Varanasi I liked it there, big time. Varanasi is exactly how I always imagined what real India is like. Cows everywhere, people everywhere. It is noisy and crazy but not too much in comparison to Delhi or Mumbai, there are tourists so people don't stare but it is not that touristy so it still feels real. With lots of tiny streets and tiny stalls. And big and small temples on every corner. And of course it is a very special place. Holy place. You can feel there is something different about this place. And the River, Ganga, the mother of Life. And Death. We wondered around the first night and walked towards the nearest ghat and bought two flower candles and let them flow on the River for a good luck. While walking around the next evening, we reached the main burning ghat where people are burnt so they escape the circle of life and death. Such a strange feeling looking into
Delhi gate
the fires and then gradually starting to recognize parts of human bodies. Head. Arm. And local people trying to take us around, trying to make us take pictures and pay for that and making comments such as ""it is a good day"" meaning there is lots of people being burnt now or trying to make us go closer saying ""come on, you will like more from down there"". One gets completely different perspective when seeing all of that together with all the people bathing in the River, doing laundry, bathing their buffalos and as it turned out cooking chai out of the holy water. Yeah, the chai we drink when we walk along the river.
There is lots of monkeys around so it is like being a part of a nature documentary film, Davy feeds them, nicely from hand to hand but we also saw scary moments when monkeys attacked people. They are running around on the roofs and stealing things and it's mad. What kind of sucks about Varanasi is the fact that the huge Kumbh Mela festival with its millions and millions of people is happening just around the corner in Allahabad and all the people leaving the
DSC_0551
festival are coming to Varanasi to bath in the River. So Varanasi is super packed, super crowded and it is pretty much impossible to find an accommodation and the prices are sometimes up to 10 times higher than usual. And I also thought that Varanasi would be the perfect spot to sink into the Indian philosophy and spirituality but it didn't really happen. Maybe it is just too busy now for a quiet mediation or maybe I am not ready for that yet. So we are leaving the holy city a little bit earlier than we planned (just in two days) and we will try to reach some nice and quiet beaches near Kolkata to recover from all the madness and hopefully to celebrate Davy's birthday somewhere nice.

And big thank you to Indu for showing us her home and for introducing us to her amazing family and sorry for any misspelling. xxx







Back on the blog again and so after our southern indian tour it was off to Delhi and the north but not without a little trouble first because after i thought i was over my sickness so of course
DSC_0555
i had a beer or 2 to celebrate and woke up the next morning dying, stomach cramps from hell so basically we were going to have to cancel our flight tickets again. these are the tickets we had cancelled from my first sickness. not cool, but i sucked it up after vomiting a few times and got on the plane, very tough journey. So we arrived in Delhi but only stayed a few hours as we were heading for Ramnagar up north in the mountains to meet our indian friend Indu who we know from back home.We killed a few hours by getting a tuk tuk around the city until our train that night. We got to ramnagar at 5 in the morning hoping that Indu's cousin was going to be here to meet us and after a little while of getting really nervous and starting to think the worst' a man came up and said 'david ', we shook hands and introduced each other and he brought us back to his house where we waited for the bus. We met his family and they gave us breakfast so everything was going according to plan. We then got the bus
SAM_2540
to meet Indu in the the village called Sult Mahadev in the mountains. The bus journey was 2 of the longest hours of my life, as we got further up the mountains the roads became thinner so much that only one vehicle could fit but they made 2 fit, it was absolute madness, the edge of the road on 1 side was just looking straight up a cliff and the other side was looking down a shere drop off a mountain and of course we got the 2 front window seats. Honestly it was like something out of a james bond movie so I told the bus driver afterwards that pilots have it easy and he should be paid a lot more and so after nearly shitting my pants we finally arrived to meet Indu.

The mountains were just amazing, its so hard to describe but mostly just peaceful.The first day we were introduced to a good few people in the village, apparently there were many people awaiting our arrival and as we soon realised that foreigners dont really make it up this far it became clear why they all wanted to meet us and touch us and just
SAM_2547
stared at us all the time constanly and sometimes when you make eye contact they smile and look away shyly, its really weird but really cool.There was a ceremony for Indu,s brother and wife (Puran and Laksmi) and we met their son and daughter (Vishal and Priya), the ceremony was cool, our first in a temple and after that it was almost a 3 hour trek up to meet the rest of the family high in the mountain and to where we would stay for the next 4 or 5 days.The trek was great cos the villagers wanted to take all our bags and insisted that we carry nothing, these bags were heavy so after the initial feeling of guilt it was actually pretty sweet.The next few days were some of my favourite, living like the flinstones and getting a real taste of indian culture. Lots of pictures and walking and seeing amazing sights and how people live up here and watching and learning from them was just an incredible experience.Thanks to Indu and your family. Awesome.

After that we went back to ramnagar but changed our plans as we got invited to a real indian wedding, simona was
On the train from Delhi to Ramnagar
very excited and the fact that we were going with Indu and the family it really felt like there was no pressure, we were both relaxed and in a great state of mind after the mountains so why not go to a wedding, ha. We got there and everyone just flocked around us, just watching and starring at our every move, most people actually stopped looking at bride and groom cos white folks were more exciting, it was as if we were celebrities. I got invited straight up to the main car to have a few whiskeys with the father of the groom and some other important people of the wedding, so after cleaning up the whiskey and a few photos with other important wedding officials it was back to the wedding itself and when i walked in everyone in the whole place was just starring at Simona , like she was a god or someone from another planet and soon after we became the life of the wedding, we got great food, met so many nice people and danced the night away. it was really different than back home and i did feel a little bad cos we basically
SAM_2555
stole the show at the wedding but even the bride and groom looked delighted that we were there, strange but really cool.

The next day guess what, i was sick again for the 3 time and thought maybe its not the food thats causing it maybe its the drink so i kinda stopped drinking for a while. We went back to dehli for 1 night and from there went to Agra to see the famous Taj Mahal,boring. Shit weather and a pretty shit day had, i must say, we went and after getting inside the gates the heavens opened up and the rain was actually hurting is was coming down so hard and so fast it was almost like a river. we cut our time short inside as we were drenched and just wanted fresh clothes which we didnt have cos all our cloths were dirty, like all our stuff was filthy so we got the taxi driver to take us to a clothes shop asap. this took him 4 different stops and over an hour of us being soaked and freezing in the back of a taxi but finally we got to the market for cheap warm clothes
Getting asyl from Shyamu's family
at which stage our wet ones were nearly dry. alot of the time they smile and nod at you as if they know what your talking about but mostly they just dont understand. So from there we go onto Varanasi, a 14 hour train jouney awaits us before reaching the holy city.

February 21st 2013

Nad ranom budicek kvoli zime,nahodil som mikinu a spal dalej.

Z ubytka som vypadol 7/35. Samozrejme problem,brana zavreta,recepcny nikde. Tak som si s namohou otvoril branu a siel sa najest k pojazdnemu voziku. Dal som si opat ako vcera rozdrvene pecivo v stiplavej omacke,pak smer bus.

Kedze som mal uz omrknute ceny zo vcera do agry a nikde nikto nezjednaval zobral som bus za neuveritelnych 350rup za 6 hodin jazdy. Hned po zaplateny ma dotiahli k busu a uz som padil smer agra. Bus opat semisleeper,lenze tento mal megapriestor na nohy,sedadlo pre 1,5 cloveka,parada. Malo to ale jednu chybu,batoh mi nedali do zavazadloveho priestoru ale mal som ho pred nojami, este,ze tam bola kopa miesta. Rozmyslal som,ze som listok mohol kupit priamo v buse, mozno by bol lacnejsi. Cesta klasika,same zastavky a naberanie ludi az pokym bus nepraskal.

Asi po 2 hodinach ku mne posadili starsiu zenu,ale vravim mega sedadlo,tak ziadne tlacenie. Vacsinu cesty som driemal. Popri ceste bola kopa kominov, vyrabali tu tehly. Najskor som myslel,ze su dake pomniky ale po priblizeny sa z toho vykluli kominy. Okolo bola kopa nevypalenych tehal. Tieto tehly formovali male deti. Inde som videl kruhy z mixu slamy,hliny,hovien. Neviem naco to sluzilo, mozno skridle. Cestou bus stal na mytniciach a platil mytne,dost ludi si budky aj s osadenstvom obzeralo, tak tomu bolo aj ked som isiel do Abu road. Fakt mi to pripadalo ako keby ludia este nikdy nevideli,kameri,pc,zavory a ostatne veci co su na mytniciach.

Do Agri sme dorazili po 6 hodinach.

Opat mi nechcelo naskocit gps,mapa z LP nepomohla,tak som sa vidal naslepo, resp som sledoval kam ide vacsina riksakov. Jeden ma chcel aj odviest ale za 100rup, zjednavat nechcel. Po asi 200m sa u mna zastavil dalsi riksak,ten uz dal za 50rup. Vysadit som sa nechal v polke cesty medzi zapadnu a juznu branu,bo uz zacala splietat o tom ako mi vybavi ubytko atd. Pri tom ako mi zastavil tak sa do riksi nasackoval policajt,si myslel,ze pojdeme dalej,no nist nebolo,tak si zas vystupil.

A cul mohlo zacat hladanie ubytka, Shanti lodge za 400rup,po zjednany za 350rup, ostatne lacne izby vraj full (tazko povedat,indovia su megaodrbavaci, horsi nez vietnamci). No nist tak som mu povedal,ze sa pokukam inde a vratim sa. Recepcny ako spravny obchodnik vravi,ze potom uz cena 350 nebude platit, iba 400. Ok. Naser si debil. Obehal som dalsie 4 ubytka,vsetko absurdne ceny, zjednavanie neexistovalo. Nakoniec ma zlakal maly soplak oproti Shanti lodge do Prince Gh,vravi,ze izba za 100rup. Parada az sa mi tomu verit nechcelo. Dvojpostel, fan,sprcha ale uboha. Zhodil som batoh a siel zas vypisat knihu prichodov. Zas som si adresu vymyslel, tentoraz je moja domaca adresa kvetinova 36 a som z mesta kokotov. Po vypisany davam recepcnemu (vsetko jedna rodina) 100rup, kuka na mna, ze cena je 400rup. Co ti sije opicak,sak tvoj soplavy brat hovoril 100. Vraj nevi dobre anglicky,no nist tak berem batoh a idem prec. V tom konecne recepcny zjednava a spim tu za 250 rup.

Rozhodol som sa,ze tu ostanem len noc a smer Dili,skoda,ze som nevedel skor, ze jaipur aj agra su totalne diery,som mohol ostat radsej na camel festivale v jaisalmere.

Behol som v tomto gh aj na jedlo,ryzu s rascu za 80rup,ou fakt palka. Wifi tu ma by zdarma ale akurat dnes maju poruchu. To je fakt smola,ale nie, nie ,viem ,ze to je odrb. Ziadny vypadok wifi neni.

Po jedle idem kuknut slavny Taj Mahal z opacnej strany,dnu nejdem,vstupne je sialene 750rup pre turistov,domaci za 20rup. Odchytavam riksaka,cena 250rup,vau krasna cena,dalsi uz dava len za 300rup. Nakonec jeden spustil na 150rup,ale moc nechapal,ze asi aku cestu chcem bo sa cestou zastavil pri dalsom riksakovy a ten mu prelozil moj ciel. Smer teda Mehtab bagh a potom nazad.

Ideme popri rieke,miname fort agra,prechadzame most a spinavymi ulickami, posiatimi chudobou,bordelom,hovnami dorazame k parku Mehtab bagh. Park je spoplatneny, vacsi turistov ide do nho a odtial si foti Taj mahal. Ja idem popri plote po ceste,dostavam sa az k vysusenej rieke,zastavuje ma plot,fotim Taj Mahal a idem nazad. Fakt pekna stavba ale za take peniaze dnu ani bohovy. Na konci cesticky pri plote boli rozlozeny vojaci,mali tam noramlny tabor,zrejme strazia Taj Mahal. V koryte rieky sa prehanalo stado koz s detskymi pastiermi.

Riskak ma veze nazad,nabera dalsich dvoch ludi,nechavam sa vylozit nakoniec pri fort agra. Davam mu 150 rup,nechapavo na mna kukol,volaco mrmle o 300, serem ho a padim prec. Zrejme si myslel,ze 150 je len za jednu cestu,nasrat ti.

Oproti mne ide koc tahany konom,z neho niekto vykrikuje slovakia,kukam a to argentincanka z camel safari. V tej rychlosti som jej stacil len zakyvat.

Do pevnosti resp.parku sa dostavam bocnou branou. Park je fajn,konecne nieco zelene. Pevnost je podla mna lepsia nez cely Taj mahal. Parkom som sa dostal az k vstupu do pevnosti. Tu kvanta otravnych riksakov,samozvanych sprievodcov. Jeden co ma furt otravoval mohol mat biznis ale po slovensky nevedel tak smola otrava. Vstupne do pevnosti pre nadludi za 250 rup,zver za 10 rup. Zvieracia pokladna samozrejme zasita na boku aby ju nadludia nevideli. Dnu teda nejdem,vystveral som a na hrdby ale zrazu po mne s pistalku piskaju vojaci,to sa nesmi robit.

Nazad do ubytka idem obklukou vdaka debilnemu znaceniu a hlavne otravnym riksakom co ma uplne pomotali a stratil som orientaciu. Na uliciach nic nove, kravy, bordel. Prenasleduje ma jeden riksak,dost dobru chvilu isiel vedla mna, nakonec ale dal pokoj. Najskor ma chcel povozit po meste,potom do ubytka a nakonec do super restiky. Normalne som mal uz nervi.

Neskor som sa dostal na hlavnu ulicu,sok,cisto,dokonca odpadkove kose.

Minul som kasarne a dostal sa az k parku co je pri zapadnej casti Taj Mahalu. Tu uz opat kopa otrav,riksaci,zebraci,predavajuce deti. V parku sa dalo vozit aj na tavach. Tie su tu dost oblubene,na ceste normalne tahaju vlecky s nakladom.

Taj Mahal akurat zatvrali ale i tak tu bola este kopa ludi. V blizkej ulicke po mne pokrikovali obchodnici z money exchange,tak reku ich skusim ci mi zamenia filipinske pesa. Obchod sa nekonal,bo ich chceli vidiet na vlastne oci. Keby ich nemam v kapsicke pod trickom neni problem ale takto som ich nechcel tahat z mojej skryse,ktora asi keby ma niekde prepadnu mi moc nepomoze.

Zakotvil som v blizkej drahej netke,povodna cena 50 ale zjednali na 30 rup/hod. V inych netkach co som videl net stoji po 40 rup. Nahadzal som CS v turecku, zistil fajn spravu o baliku,po 3 tyzdnoch konecne opustil indiu.

V obchodiku este kupa vody,zo 17 na 15 rup,na obale bola max.cena 15,tak sa ho pytam co to a on ,ze ok teda. Z jaipure mi zlavil z 20 (max.cena na obale) na 13,by ma zaujimalo za kolko to nakupuju. Nemali mi vidat 5 rup,tak mi dali privesok slona na kluce.

Na veceru som vybehol oproti do shanti lodge,cakal som paradny vyhlad na Taj Mahal ale ten sa nekonal. Neni v noci nasvieteny,tak som videl len obrysy. Jedlo lacnejsie a kvalitnejsie nez u mna,wifi je tu za poplatok. Mam platit 140rup,nema mi vidat z 500-ky,tak mu davam 130,ze nech da zlavu,s neochotou to bere.

500-ku nakoniec rozmienam v malom obchodiku,kde robim nakup len za 40rup. Kupujem 3x keksi a 0,3 coca colu.

V ulicke som si dal este vajcov chleba,bolo to fajn,platil som tak ako domaci len s tym rozdielom,ze oni dostali zhruba o 30%!v(MISSING)acsiu porciu.

Nakonec som v ATM vybral 8000rup,to mi bude stacit. Opat bolo treba najskor zasunut kartu,vysunut ju a az potom zacal ATM pracovat.

4000rup by som mal minut na jedlo,ubytko a prepravu,ostatne na suveniry.

V cestovke som zistoval ceny vlaku a busu do agry,vlak za 200,bus za 400 ale tazko verit odrbavacom.

Nebudem riskovat ten vlak ale pojdem klasickym statnym busom. No nic vlak teda v indii neskusim,mozno nabuduce.

Na ubytku bola cela rodina majitela,robia riadny ramus,tepla voda neni. Zeby som sa sprchoval az za tyzden v istanbule,jooo cune.

Este som si vypytal cistu plachtu ,bo sa mi zdala tato spinava. Kurva,hrozne ubytka su v tejto indii.

Bet you weren't expecting us back this quickly!! Well we had to pay for an hour and it doesn't take that long to check your emails now does it! Mind you what a first afternoon in Delhi. Picked up by a crazy rickshaw driver who offered to take us to The Red Fort for 100 rupees and 2 hours later not only had we seen this great piece of ancient architecture we had also been through most of the bazaar, seen a tiny but gorgeous and ancient temple tucked away in the backstreets, had a tour of the spice market literally from the groundfloor to the roof; had a go at making red chilli paste, bought a serious stock of spices to bring home, run over an unfortunate pedestrian's foot, learned several new Indian oaths and probably escaped serious injury several times by the width of an inner tube!! At the end of all that he wanted 300 rupees - we gave him 500 and felt we'd still had the better end of the deal.

We ended the day with a super buffet in the hotel where we could try lots of different dishes- yummy- although we did wonder if we were going to get this deal as no-one seemed to know about what exactly we had booked- good old internet!!!

Up early tomorrow for grand Golden Triangle Tour- Agra and Jaipur here we come!!!

So this is just a short message to let you all know we are fine. We had absolutely crazy week with an absolute highlight of our trip in the mountains with Indu and with some down in other places. We will be staying in Varanasi for next few days so we should have some time to fill you in with all the details and upload some photos. Sending lots of love from Simona and Davy

Street party under our balcony
J:

Having said goodbye to Han, Kylie, Dana, Meagan and Timo at Kathmandu, Holly and I flew down to start our Indian adventure in one of the holiest cities – Varanasi. We'd been bracing ourselves for pandemonium but the arrival airport was deserted and even the passport control seemed orderly and efficient. We found our pick-up straight away with a minimum of hassle which took us straight to the right hotel and we were checked into a clean enough room in minutes. So far, so uncrazy. Whilst skyping my mum an increasingly loud drumming noise approached, and on going to our balcony to check out the commotion we found a wedding party replete with a full band and dancers had decided to decamp in the small, grotty lane in the middle of nowhere where our hotel was located, right under our window was the ideal place to celebrate matrimonial union. The drumming got louder, the dancers a blur of colour and cars stopped to beep along. The chaos had begun.

Take Varanasi train station. There was a cow in the terminal. There were elderly people attached to IV drips lying on the floor outside. This was not like home.
The Ganges


The cultural mores of the city are also often very different to what we're used to. For example, showing bare shoulder in public would be deeply offensive, but stopping to take a shit on the side of a busy throughfare is fine. It's for this reason, and the fact that cows and dogs are everywhere, that walking down the road can be fraught with olfactory peril. You smell shit and piss but then occasionally wafts of amazing cooking drift past.

Varanasi is a city with the approximate population of Auckland whose people play out their daily lives for all to see on the ghats on the banks of the Ganges. We saw people eat, sell, bathe, pray, drink, play cricket, beg, rest, do laundry, perform religious displays, cremate loved ones and sleep. It took people-watching to a new level.

The driving throughout Asia has been various shades of cavalier, but the roads in India are particularly reckless. Varanasi made the traffic in Kathmandu look like a road safety video. The streets are 'shared' by cars, buses, cyclists, rickshaws and pedestrians all trying everything they can to inch further forward. We saw rickshaws attempt to squeeze through impossibly
Holly on the ghats
small gaps and scrape vehicles on both sides, cars overtake into oncoming traffic or occasionally undertake on pavements. Sometimes drivers got out of their vehicles to shout at someone or kick rickshaws. One particularly unbalanced rickshaw driver we had gestured for me to take over steering at one point whilst he kept an unrelenting foot hard down on the accelerater. I won't deny the dodgem swerves weren't immensely fun but the girls in the back didn't seem to enjoy it quite as much.

Lindsay and Sam joined us a couple of days after we arrived. On their first morning we were all woken with a start by dozens of angry Hindi voices in the hotel corridors. The hotel manager knocked on our room and asked me to step into the corridor, where a group of men looked me up and down. Once they were satisfied I wasn't the person they were looking for they continued onto the next room in search of somebody. The furious shouting continued so we went out for breakfast, and on our way out saw the full scale of the angry mob, with men occupying the entire hotel lobby and spilling out onto the street
View over the Ganges
outside. We never did find out what raised their fury, and what retribution was to be meted out the their unfortunate quarry.

The Ganges is said to be at it's most magical at dawn, so we all rose early to take in the sunrise from a boat floating down the river. What greeted us when we got to the ghats was a blanket of thick mist. Failing to even see where the river was, we went back to bed and returned at a more sociable hour. The view from the boat wasn't really any better than the view from the ghats. The only difference was that the boat afforded a close up of lots of pot-bellied, middle-aged men bathing on the banks. An image I could have left India without and felt none the poorer.

After five days of bedlam in Varanasi we took an overnight train to Agra, the home of the Taj Mahal. Our train rolled in at 10.30am, a mere five hours late. We spent our first day exploring the red bricked Agra Fort, the stronghold which held J Shah – the Taj Mahal's creator – for the latter years of his life. At least
The ghats
his cell had a great view of his famous mausoleum across the road.

The following day we went to the Taj Mahal. Built of impeccably maintained semi-translucent white marble, it sparkled. The design follows mathematical ordained specifications – perfectly rotationally symmetric, exactly as tall as wide and the size of external lettering gradually increased with height so to appear the same size when viewed from ground level. It short, it exuded cleanliness and order – two qualities in short supply in India – but still felt utterly at home in it's surroundings.

Manniskor som brants vid Marikarnika ghat
Cirka 100 meter harifran liggen den storsta ""brinnande ghaten"", Marikarnika ghat. Sedan jag kom hit har jag sett manga brinnande kroppar. Livet ar annorlunda har. Doden ar mer accepterad, mer naturlig. Hemma ar slutet mer Slutet, medan har ar det mer som att nagonting nytt borjar.

Ingen grater. Har inte sett nagon falla en enda tar. Bredvid de brinnande manniskorna gar kossor, hundar, getter och barn som leker. Som om det vore ingenting. Det ar ganska fascinerande. Skulle kunna sta dar i timmar, bland folket, och bara titta. Det ar som en lugn, meditativ atmosfar runt hela kremeringsplatsen.

Varanasi ar lugnare och skonare an Delhi maste jag saga. Aven fast de tutar som galningar och vill salja saker och erbjuda rickshaws har ocksa. Man far akta sig! Tank er Gamla stans grander fulla med manniskor, och motorcyklar som tutar sa att det tjuter i oronen, sa ar det typ.



Igar var jag pa ett musikashram och hade en lektion i subhara (som sitar fast lagre stamd) vilket var skoj. Pa vag till Varanasi fran Delhi traffade jag en harlig japan som heter Hokuto. Vi delar rum och har hangt har ganska mycket. Han gillar cigaretter och

brod. Han har aven lart mig att ata med handerna.

Jag har det mestadels skont, men lite jobbigt pa samma gang. Igar kandes som en andlos dag, som om jag gick fram och tillbaka hela dagen. Jag skulle till aptemplet. Ungefar sahar var det hela dagen

- Where is the monkey temple? - That way, 2 kilometers (pekar vanster). Jag gar dit, genom damm och ett evigt tutande. Inget monkey temple. Fragar en annan. - Excuse me, where is the monkey temple? - Hmm, take left, right, then left hand side 500 meters. - Thank you. Namaste. Gar dit. Inget aptempel. Fram och tillbaka, i en andlos spiral. Fragar saker 15 indier. Tuut tuuut tuuutt!! i princip hela tiden. - Excuse me. Monkey temple please? - Aha. 1 kilometer that way (hallet jag precis gatt ifran). - Thank you. Namaste. Inget monkey temple dar heller. Inte vart jag forvanad heller!

Till slut hittade jag det och det var vart det. De fina sma aporna. De ser ut som gamla tjocka gubbar och sma barn. En forsokte ta mina indiska snacks. No! sa jag till den. Den tittade pa mig med giriga ogon, ""Ge mig. Nu!"".

Jag

gav den inget. Istallet hittade jag nagra miniapor som jag gav lite till. De borjade slass.

Imorgon ska jag och Hokuto till det beryktade Mela Kumbh Mela (som intraffar vart 144e ar). Det ska vara oerhort manga manniskor dar, manga ""naga sadhus"", nakna heliga man!, folk som badar i Ganges, och ett allmant liv med mycket religiosa inslag.

India - (763)
Day 22: Agra and the Taj Mahal
We woke up and were out the door early to catch the 7am train to Agra from Delhi. We organized with our hotel to drop us off.We had second class seats so we found our seats, put our baggage overhead and strapped them in so that they could not be taken easily or discreetly. The train ride was about 5 hours arriving in Agra 1 hour late. We were surrounded by locals for the trip. Because it was Ale's first train ride in India I got some chai from a passing vendor. We arrived in Agra at 12pm. I used a very good site to check the train status at raildb.comWhen we got to Agra we were hounded by tuktuk touts and battled our way through them to the prepaid booth. It was 150 into town. Another older local man went with us in the small white car-taxi. It ended up that he was an agent who traveled around taking tourists to the sights for the day. His name was Munu. He had a book full of written letters from previous tourists. He asked us for 600 for a half day tour to the
India - (764)
'mini' Taj Mahal, the Agra Fort and of course the Taj Mahal, plus a few other smaller places. We first went and got our hotel. It was a 5 min walk from the Taj Mahal and the hotel rooftop restaurant and incidentally our room had views of the Taj.We started our tour with Munu and his driver to the mini Taj. It was built 20 years prior and the Taj Mahal was based on the same concept and style, just on a larger more ornate scale. We went into the grounds which featured the white marble building in the middle of a garden grounds surrounded by red sandstone walls. We wandered into the grounds, going along the outside, and climbing up the wall to its corner tower. We also explored the riverside section of the wall before making our way to the mahal. The entire building was white marble with intricate and symmetrical designs all over. The designs were largely floral, but no two sections were identical. Inside was four tomb-like rooms on the corners and four larger entrances or hallways connecting them.We then were driven to Agra Fort across the river. The fort was huge and full of different
India - (765)
palaces built by different kings. We walk up the main ramp into the fort. Apparently the military occupied parts of the fort. It's rather difficult to describe the interiors of the forts given the complexities of the history and the seeming chaoticness of the layout. The first two areas we visited were large open pruned gardens with a few resident macaques in one corner. There were lines of planted annuals and grass lawns. At the end was what looked like a white mosque but was closed to public. There was also an open stone pillared area. On the riverside the fort was more a maze of corridors, stairs leading to various rooms, temples, palaces, viewpoints, and courtyards. Pictures tell a better story here and should be uploaded by March 2013 so check back then. The next area was a viewpoint across the river to the Taj Mahal, with many varieties of birds flying around and perching on the buildings. There were a few palaces and many other viewpoints as we headed from the northerly side to the south. In the southernmost side, the buildings were mostly ruins. We headed out, found Munu and he took us to a 'cheap local'
India - (766)
restaurant that was neither cheap nor local and it certainly was not good food. Afterwards he took us to what likely was a commissioned place where they carved marble. The man showed us some workers doing inlays into marble that would be sold as souvenirs. He then eagerly showed us his store and we ended up buying a couple of immature Taj Mahals made of alabaster for 200 after it was originally 800. He insisted it was marble although I knew there was no way. Marble is difficult to work with.The next commissioned shop was in a jewelry store but neither of us was interested and in any case it's hard to tell the authentic stones and metals from cheaper fakes. Well unless you know your stuff and I don't. No point in needless risks. Finally we headed to the Taj Mahal. He dropped us off and we paid him his fee plus a 10% tip. We walked to the Eastern Gate of the Taj and there was a serious security check. They went through all our bags, checked inside everything and threw away all food and even tried to throw away a deck of unopened playing cards. We were
India - (767)
in and the first area led to a very large red sandstone gate, and all around we're the red walls. We entered the main area and there it was, the Taj Mahal, with a couple of long waterways leading up to it giving that typical 'Taj Mahal' shot you've seen a hundred times from anyone who has been. We waited our turn to take our shots and then walked closer taking shots from different angles as we got nearer. People were split into the ""High Importance People"" (read: foreigner) and ""Low Importance People"" (read: Indian). lines going different ways up to the Taj. Now given the price difference, I wasn't offended as foreigners pay significantly more. The only real difference was the local line wound around the base of the Taj and the foreigner line went more directly up before meeting up. The Taj Mahal was a majestic piece of architecture widely thought of as the most beautiful building in the world. It's made of white marble with symmetrical carved inlays all over. Again no two sections were identical, and there was precision with its symmetry and geometric shapes and floral designs.On each of the four corners stood a tall
India - (768)
minaret with the middle being the main building. Inside the Taj Mahal was the tomb of the wife of the king that built the Taj Mahal as a tomb for his favorite wife. I'm sure the other two were a tad jealous. No pictures were allowed and guards were frequently removing cameras and their owners rather forcibly. When we went out, the sun was starting to set so we walked around the building taking photos of the Taj and the sunset. Once it was getting dark, the soldiers with assault rifles started to round people up to kick them out of the grounds. We left quickly. We got back to our hotel and quickly fell asleep after the long day.

February 5th 2013
Published: February 5th 2013


A crazy 5 days. Aneirin arrived at midnight - delayed due to his bag, along with everyone's on his flight, being left in Singapore. Sadly though we held out hope for it's return, we left Delhi without it, and thus Aneirin will have to accumulate his equipment from markets at our destinations to become. If it had happened to me after so much planning I think I would have totally flipped; Aneirin has taken the best attitude and we let out a little boat with a flame in it as a homage to his lost bag - gone but never forgotten. The sentimental moment was abruptly extinguised by a little lady washing herself on the ghat who took a swipe at our vessel, ending a heartbreakingly short journey for our 50rupee boat.

We spent 2 full days in Delhi. Our first was in brilliant weather and we enjoyed over 9 hours of wandering around the old city, markets, alleys and the majestic Jama Masjid. To acclimatise and shrug off the touts, we slippd down a particularly dodgy looking side road (""this is not safe place for you"") and wound our way to an intimidating Muslim section, complete with a couple of Pakistan flag murals. Happily, wewere pointed in the direction of the kids play area, where we watched and eventually took part in a game of cricket. Aneirin for hispart put in 2 superb catches; it will come as a surprise to many of my friends that I bowed out for a golden duck after confidently strutting to the wicket. Dignity in tatters, we slinked away to enjoy a sunny day at Delhi's many tourist attractions.

The Jama Masjid - biggest mosque in India (25,000 capacity) - was brilliant. After an aggressive negotioation with the entry guard and a 'guide' (Aneirin had to get his phone out to 'call the police' to get them to bug off) we managed to bribe our way up the public minaret which afforded us spectacular views of the city's vast canopy around us. Directly below us, a near-constant orchestra of horns provides the entirely approproiate soundtrack to whichthe city pulses. The junction from which the most noise eminated was in the process of playing out a traffic-planner's nightmare as the scarcely-followed rules of the world were totally abandonned in the pileup of tuktuks, cycle rickshaws, taxis, cows, donkeys, trailers, and a crush ofhuman traffic filtering through. In one of those happy coincidences that India can pride herself on, this junction on further inspection housed the 'car part' market, where stacks of tyres and wingmirrors teeter ominously towards the pandemonium. On still closer inspection, the common product of these stalls is the replacement horn.

The food as of yet has been beyond description. We sweat and cry our way through the curries but the real culinary delights are to be found in the non-tourist bazaars where the local food is prepared infront of you in all it's smokey and greasey glory. Current prize goes to the production-line that made us our best chai to date (the owner and local customers were very happly that we elected to join them in the tiny shop to drink).

The second full day began with a thunderstorm and was considerably colder than the day before, but we splashed our way around Connought Place, meeting a nice young fellow called Ravi who taught us some Hindi (forgotten instantly) and directed us to a brilliant veggie restaurant where we experienced a ridiculously broad range of flavours, all provided in tiny metal bowls with rice and bread (those experienced travellers amoung us might think he was on comission from this restaurant, but we know he wasn't).

We had booked our train to Varanasi in the morning, and so that evening we found ourselves sprinting through the streets on New Delhi with all our bags, anxious that we'd miss our train. We scampered onto the metro which happened to be at it's most jam-packed (rush hour) so after an incredibly sweaty journey we spilled out to our departure station, bought some Biriyani from the kiosk outside and hopped onto our 3AC sleeper carriage, excitedly noting our names on the side of the carriage door.

The train was one of those quinisential 'India experiences' and proved to be well worth the 600R fare. We were joined in out berth by 2 Japenese, a Korean and an Israeli, with whom we enthusiatically swapped stories, food and facebook profiles. Finally - some like-minded travellers on our budget! They told us they were staying in a Japenese-owned hostel looking over a ghat and said we were welcome to join them; we took them up on their offer and are paying a low 150R for a river-front shared room with out new friends, who turn out to be be very fun to explore with.

As night fell, we all lay in our cramped berths, each traveller rattling contentedly in his own thoughts. Every so often, the haunting manta 'hot chaiii, hot chaiiii' would draw closer, brush past my overhanging feet and clatter away down the train. As I began to drop off, I was gifted one of those 'wow, I'm actually in India' moments which have been sneaking up on me recently. I sincerely hope the reoccur indefinatley.

The tuktuk ('autorickshaw'😉 ride to this hostel was borderline suicidal. We squeezed 6 people, including the driver, into the tiny vehicle which could hadly move with all our luggage destroying the rear suspension. Yoshki got a brilliant video of the drive, during which we very nearly came to a sticky end at the expense of a charging cow. The driver earnt his 120R through some incredible skill employed to keep us all in one piece.

Will have more on Varanasi when I next write, but this first day has been spectacular. On reaching the river bank of the most polluted river in the world, I was struck immediatley by it's beauty. My eyes have had a real wrokout digesting the multitude of colours and peoples that flow along the ghats - the Hindus in search of that elusive Moksha and their relsease from the cycle of reincarnation. Aneirin and I popped into the 'Golden Temple' which was utterly swamped with Hindus in feverish ambulation. We beat a fairly hasty retreat after offering a necklace of flowers to Nandi the bull, but not after getting swabbed in the face with some paint and dodging a few bounding monkeys. The cremation ghats were the most interesting. Hard to digest at first, but then the families of those being incinerated are visably happy - joyous in the belief that their loved one has acheieved enlightenment through the magic of the Ganges.

More to come after the Kumbh Mela - now reportedly 100 million people in one place! Can't wait!

India-533
Day 15 Allahabad
I woke up, made hot water for shower using the water heater I brought. I headed out with the Australian as we walked about 7 km to the edge of Kumh Mela - the largest festival in the world. The last 'half' festival had 70 million and this year was the full Kumh Mela held every 12 years.
The festival is held in a gigantic tent city spread out for and enormous distance mainly along the river, in particular the floodplains. The festival centres around bathing in where India's 2 holiest rivers meet to cleanse you of your sins. Temporary homes, stores, temples and roads were set up. It was near a major military base so there were lots of gun-toting soldiers around, plus many traffic police.
There were thousands of people milling around. Many crippled beggars, beggar children, and lots of people selling stuff like beaded necklaces, plastic jugs to take the holy water, and dye for the head.
The ground was dust so the roads were plank of metal set down in rows, and there were water tankers spraying water to minimize the dust pickup. There were corporate sponsors and promo booths set up. It was
India-534
gigantic, chaotic and crowded. As we walked many Indian men came up to talk to the Australians. We'd shake one and there were more to take his place. One came to me and kept talking. Another one took us to the main river section. There were hundreds lined on the river taking a bath. Off in the middle of the river was a large collection of boats also for bathing.
We walked towards a temporary footbridge setup on floating bins. There were many of these bridges set up, some even had vehicle traffic.
We took a quick tour around before the Australians decided it was time to get breakfast and head back to hotel. They had an afternoon flight.
We walked back to the entrance with our entourage, ate pakoras for breakfast and parted ways. I headed to a temple on a hill for the views. Inside I found a somewhat quiet section and used it to take a break from the crowds and to get a better view of the scope. The tents went as far as I could see.
After a bit I headed back, wandering by the old but still occupied fort. Men with guns didn't like
India-535
me taking photos so I moved on back to the fathers by the river. I headed to where the boats were and jumped on an occupied boat.
It was headed to the river centre where other boats were set up as a platform for the bathers. Along the way were thousands of gulls flocking to the bits of food thrown to them by people.
We docked and seeing my whiteness (and the assumed money attached), I got invited first. I was give 3 coconuts as an offering, a priest said a prayer which I butchered when I repeated and then blessed me with the holy river water. For a fee of course. They were asking for 1000's but I only had 300 on me so I gave them 200. Seeing that I only had that much eased the pressure. The locals dipped into the river, one by one. Men first, children second and women last. I finished my water and used the bottle to grab some of the holy water as a keepsake. Once done we headed back and the boatman was trying to squeeze Mr for 5 times normal price and was quite persistent. I ended up paying 50
India-536
Rs. 10 more than the local price.
I walked off and headed to the other side wandering down a lane until the corner and back. There were lots of temple / sermons going on, some in extravagant tent structures. They all blasted their music and/or sermon in an attempt to outdone each other.
Eventually after 8 hours of walking I headed back. I had some reserve money in my bag but it was a large bill and I needed to break it in a proper store to have the change needed to take an autorickshaw back. So I walked a few km and then got the autorickshaw for a chunk of the way home.
Once back I relaxed for a bit before finding a rare sit-down restaurant and had some pasta.
My train was at 1 so I waited for a bit before heading into the nearby station.

India-437
Day 14 - Varanasi
We got up early at 6am and headed down to the riverside. It was thick with fog. We came out at a ghat which is something like and access point to the holy Ganges or 'Ganga' pronounced 'Gang-ga'.
At this ghat was a holy man doing a prayer on the top of a little structure. Nearby was his gentle with a fire inside with a few dogs curled up sleeping for warmth.
We walked alongside the river for a few minutes and then back but the fog was so thick it was impossible to make anything out or get a sense of scale.
We ended up getting a boat ride for an hour as the fog lifted to reveal the old architecture of the city and its eccentric and colourful residents. Our footman oared us downstream, past many ghats and Indians bathing in the water.
Varanasi is a city you must experience to understand. The actions, the sights, the smells can not be adequately described in words nor pictures.
The entire stretch of waterfront of Varanasi is situated on the northern banks of the river. It is an old and historic city and you can see the old
India-438
buildings and towers lining the side. The buildings are old are poorly maintained. Most have somewhat fading painted advertisements for silk, yoga, hotels or other tourist things. Many buildings have been converted into temples, hotels, or homes but a surprising number are empty and derelict. Down below are stone staircases and walkway providing a path to walk along the river and access from the city.
Across the river is a flood plain with those preferring a little bit more privacy to bathe. After all who doesn't like to get theire photo shot hundreds of times by strange people from another land while washing your body?
Along the ghats themselves, there still are lots of locals down to take a bath or to do laundry. It's mostly men and older women though. There are also the men swinging laundry in the air before smacking it onto a rock in the river. Dogs are everywhere and occasionally you can hear them yelling as they fight for territory or supremacy. Cows plod along or sleep content and monkeys roam the building tops.
Men are wearing just underwear as they drunk in the river and then scrub all over with soap. Women are wearing
India-439
their saree as they do the same having to scrub under the clothing.
2 of the ghats are 'burning ghats' and its where they burn the bodies of the deceased before releasing them into the holy river.
After the boat ride or footman took us to the Muslim quarter to see silk being made by the men and the to a distributor where we got shown silk sarees and scarves. The girls bargained to the point of making the seller cringe and got a significant reduction. I took advantage and bought some gifts as well.
We then went and had breakfast, reserved our respective train tickets and went back to hotel to pack and shower.
At this point I said my goodbyes and headed out on my own. I walked down the the ghats and along, getting a closer look at all of the action. Men were quite aggressive here. They would try and shake your hand and then firmly start massaging it and massaging the back of your neck. It took quite a strong push to make them back off.
Occasionally it smelt like food but most of the way smelt like urine as the men would urinate everywhere
India-440
and in full public view.
Near the burning ghat I got mobbed by lots of guys. Even as I shook one off, more were there. They took me up to an empty room over top and then wouldn't let me leave before I paid them off.
I kept walking until there were no more ghats. I then tried my luck up in the city weaving through the narrow alleys, but it was slow going with all the twists and detours. Not to mention having to avoid all of the bikes and cows.
I found myself back on the ghats and proceeded to walk to the other end of the ghats. Once done I headed up into the city and followed a main road back to the hotel.
I grabbed my stuff and took a cyclerickshaw to the bus terminal to go to Allahabad.
I found the bus and there were 2 Australian girls on it. The bus took 3 hours and near the end the ticket kept trying to ask questions in broken English and then giggle excitedly when I answered. 5 minutes later he would do it again.
Once we were in Allahabad we walked to find a hotel,
India-441
settling on the cheapest listed, Royal Hotel. It was the royal stables at one point and now is a run down hotel. Rooms were huge with ancient furniture. Blankets were dusty. And I found both a large rat and a small mouse in the room.

Brrrr chilly Billy
Blog 16-19 January 2013 Varanasi and Agra

""Guess what is in my hands"" a very smiley and chatty gentlemen says to me. The only words that came to me were ""I hope it's not a rat""?! Vicky, our waiter reveals with a giggle that in fact it's a small statue of Ganesh the God of good fortune and knowledge that is actually nestled in his cupped hands outstretched to me. This gift is just what we needed as we were about to embark on our trip out of Delhi, he is also known as Lord of beginnings - how very apt. It turned out that Vicky's friendly attentiveness was actually meant as encouragement to write a review about him on Trip Advisor (online site) so that his boss would look on him favourably! We've decided that we're open to these blatant bribes if it means we get friendly folk out of it. It has been interesting to see how times have changed. Gone are the days of rocking up to a place unannounced and haggling a good price for a room that you've seen. Now it's all about online and telephone bookings, nothing else is accepted. It seems my experience
image
is now outdated.

Everyday so far I have been wearing an average of 4-5 layers. It is not the subtropical climate we come to associate with India. The locals have puffer jackets and wooly hats to fend off the cold and are gathered around fires. The goats are wrapped in custom made coats and dogs are snuggled up in cardies. We can only imagine that if it had been sweltering the smell would be hard to stomach in some of the places we've visited and I wouldn't be snivelling with a tiresome cold! I have to say that my my travel hair dryer has definitely come in handy so far - I feel very smug in the face of all you nonbelievers who thought I was being excessive.

Varanasi greeted us with horns blaring and people absolutely everywhere. We got incredibly disorientated after our 24hour door to door journey but were lucky enough to be led through the narrow alleys, over tangled string from hundreds of abandoned children's kites, to our hotel on the bank of the Ganges in the old town. Varanasi is one of the oldest cities in the world (since 6th C BC) and is
image
at the centre of the Hindu universe. It is among the holiest of places that allows devotees to access the divine and cleanse themselves by washing in the water. Pavilions and palaces were built in the 18th century lined by stone steps known as the 'Ghats''. The whole place is quite surreal. As the mists clear in the morning an empty sand bank appears across the other side of the epic river. The sunrise boat trip also reveals the extent of the settlement along the Ghats where the old decaying palaces rise up as a dramatic backdrop to those bathing, purifying and cleansing themselves. A few metres along the river are the burning ghats. This is a whole other experience altogether as it is where they cremate the corpses at the waters edge. We found this unnerving as the fascination with this cultural difference juxtaposed with the somber atmosphere. The proximity of the burning, washing of clothes and bathing is intriguing but everyone has their own agenda and it all seems to fit together.

After avoiding looking too closely at the river for floating body parts, negotiating our way through massive boats full of Indian tourists, and sidestepping holy
image
men dressed up to the nines we managed to have a day visiting the temples. First we went to the Golden Temple. Over 20,000 Hindus visit per day. It has recently been opened up to non Hindus and we were told we were very lucky to go in. It turns out this was not a spiritually enlightening experience for us. Far from it. We were pushed through hyper crowds, bare footed, as everyone shoved each other for a mere 10 seconds to drop offerings at the shrine as people were pulled out and shunted past. Some people would have made a pilgrimage there and then queued for 3 hours for this pleasure. This stressful conveyor belt of an experience left us feeling exploited and disappointed. It felt like a manufactured process of how they give offerings and prayer rather than a culturally enriching experience. We can only assume the reason they now let tourists in is for a money making scandal. This is completely different from the overall experience of religion we got from Varanasi.

Although Varanasi was busy it wasn't half as hectic as nearby (3 hours away) Allahabad. India's Kumbh Mela festival is currently on and is
image
usually described as the world's biggest gathering. Driven by a belief that a dip in the Ganges on auspicious days will cleanse sins and help bring salvation, millions of Hindus come to the festival in the city of Allahabad every 12 years. Officials in charge of the festival say eight million people took to the waters on Monday, when the 55-day festival opened. This is an exciting time for everyone and was a very hot topic of conversation but we thought it would be too much for us to fit in and we'd probably drown in the swarming mass of people!

All in all we have received far less hassle in India than I was expecting. People are genuinely interested in talking to us and many have a fun sense of humour and on the whole are quite respectful. they will leave us alone when we aren't interested in something. We've been pretty laid back so far adopting the popular frame of mind 'no worry, no hurry, no chicken curry'. Talking of food...we're loving the curries. We have gone Thali crazy. You can't beat a full selection of curries to gobble down even at 10.30am! We really enjoyed Varanasi

and left feeling settled in India. Another train ride jam packed with burps (nearly into my mouth), farts and snorting from our very close neighbours in our 3rd class bunks and we arrived in Agra (only 2 hours late this time). I don't think I'll ever get over the sound of Justin Bieber waking me up on Indian trains, blaring from the mobile of grey haired middle aged men...maybe I'll come home a Belieber?!

Agra is more hectic than anywhere else we've been. We arrived in the thunder, lightning and rain. Our favourite bits were walking down out-of-the-way bazaars with shop keepers laying out sari after sari in front of rows of women and street vendors deep frying puffy chapatis. We took a ride in 'India's helicopter', also known as the average rickshaw, to see the Baby Taj and then to a swanky hotel to pretend we were living the highlife, to have a cocktail and see the Taj Mahal from a distance. I don't think we we're fooling anyone.

Our 6am start this morning got us to the Taj Mahal in time for the sunrise and we stayed for a good 3 hours. It is stunning and

beautiful but most people only really seemed to care about taking the typical 'pinching the spire on tiptoe' photos. Charlie managed to smuggle in the copy of Farmers Weekly to remind us of our roots! This is despite our playing cards and 2 batteries from Charlie's 3 battery torch being confiscated. Not quite sure what kind of damage we could have done with that contraband?

Something that I am trying to come to terms with is Charlie's celebrity like status here... On at least 5 different occasions so far Indian men have stopped us in the street to take their photo with Charles Green - they just can't get enough of him, he is in high demand! Obviously I'll try not to let this get to his head too much but I have seen him practising his pout in the mirror ever since.

The Agra Fort is an impressive representation of power. We are becoming tighter by the day and decided to guide ourselves through the fort with the Rough Guide as our companion! I would love to see what it had been like with rugs, silks and decorations - perhaps i should have left the feedback on

a comments card? Charlie received a good luck squelchy and slightly runny token from a parrot right on the forehead - lets hope this means we have a smooth journey on to Jaipur. We had our most local lunch today at a cafe on the side of the road. We both ate for £1.50 including a generous tip, it was delicious and definitely the spiciest to date... fingers crossed we won't be seeing it again...!

At the Taj - Agra
Delhi

So the long wait is over and S & L arrive at Delhi International Airport on their Etihad flight via Abu Dhabi on time at 3.10 am, which means we have had to get up very early to meet them here with a cab from the Hotel Maan K where we are staying in Karol Bagh. Rs 750 + Parking (Rs140) seemed reasonable to us.

It’s great to see them and we hope they will have a great time in India with us. After a short kip the girls are ready to hit (gently) the streets of Delhi. Inevitably they are suffering from jet lag so we plan an easy day for them. First a trip on the Delhi Metro (with a no smoking, no drinking and no eating policy + Air Con – London has a lot to learn!) to Chandni Chowk to see the Jama Masjid.

It’s Rs 300 for entry with a camera. Nothing without – although they will try it on for those who don’t know and the charge seems to apply only to foreign visitors not the locals. Also the 300 seems to be something new as the tickets are overwritten on
Beautiful views from Shaniya Palace Hotel, Agra
the original 200 price. For a place of worship to operate this way seems to be totally counter to the values of the faith. Perhaps it’s all about Manna these days!!! Pathetic really especially as the place looks like it has not been looked after – it’s pretty tired and looks a poor imitation of its former self and it’s definitely is not worth the entry price for the camera. The Mosque elders really need to take a long hard look at this and the “entry pricing” system.

As it’s getting late in the afternoon & the girls are tired we skip the planned Red Fort visit and go to Connaught Place (now known as Rajiv Chowk) for something to eat. To show the girls some of M’s childhood places we go to the United Coffee House for lunch. It’s 3 pm and yet the place is full and we have to queue.

Somehow, the centre of Delhi doesn’t look quite as chaotic as it was when we were here a couple of months ago. Not sure much has changed – maybe we have just got more accustomed to the chaos and it all appears normal, calmer and
Bring me sunshine - Fathepur Sikri
“serene” (if one could ever use this word to describe anything in any big city in India).

However, it was worth the short wait – the place has had a refit of sorts but looks still pretty retro, the staff a lot smarter and the whole place was buzzing. The food was really good and whilst the prices have gone up - for the centre of Delhi this was fab grub. We promised to come back for our last night’s dinner here before the girls leave for London.

The next day we set off for Humayun’s Tomb by Metro – the idea was to do the South Delhi highlights. The place was packed and looked pretty impressive (it’s supposed to be the original on which Taj Mahal was modelled and you can see why).

We decided to walk the Delhi Zoo (which on the map looks close by – no such luck) to see the white tiger and a few other interesting animals kept here. M spent many a birthday here with family and friends + his Mum’s awesome picnics in the grounds. It’s flanked by the Purana Quila which adds something to the area. However, the
Celebs at Fathepur Sikri
sign posting was pretty ropey and we got lost quite a few times.

The walk was a bit long and we went past Sunder Bazar (fancy area – a bit like Shanti Niketan where Tony & Parul live). We stumble onto a small shack (Kamal’s) doing a host of street food, packed with locals so we sit down for some good food. The girls loved it – gol guppa, aloo tikki chaat, chole batura etc.

At the Zoo the highlights are a dirty white tiger (found at last after many blind alleys), sloth bears, an Asiatic Lion, an African Lion, elephants, giraffes etc – all in very good nick.

Next it’s onto India Gate by Metro which is packed with day trippers come to see the sun set here. The long road down Rajpath leads to the Houses of Parliament and preparations are well under way for the Republic day celebrations on the 26th Jan’13. We notice that they now have battery operated smaller Tuk Tuks plying up and down Rajpath.

Next day, it’s time to visit the Red Fort (Rs 250 per person entry as are most monuments in India for foreign visitors). The girls
Humayun's Tomb - Delhi
enjoy the trip however, M & C are pretty disappointed, M more so. The place is in terrible decay – it has none of the charm, beauty and presence of what it looked like even 15 years ago when we came here last and definitely not a patch on what it was when M saw it as a boy.

In our view, the place is not worth visiting in its current state and definitely not worth the entry fee. The sad fact is that poor management of local tourists have caused the demise of what was once a beautiful sight – even with all the “security” around Indian visitors were trampling all over the site venturing into forbidden areas. It’s their heritage and they disrespect it at their peril.

After the disappointing start and a fruitless traipse around Chandi Chowk looking for a recommended place to eat, we go to Rajiv Chowk for lunch at Nizams. It’s a local institution for Muslim food – pretty awesome if a bit greasy (very according to C who didn’t enjoy it at all) kathi kababs. Mutton, chicken or fish, reasonable prices and packed out with locals despite the competition – new
Early morning Varanasi
in town – Mc Donalds which was heaving with customers (99%!l(MISSING)ocals)

The girls want to get some shopping so we venture into Palika bazar – an underground AC market in the centre of Rajiv Chowk that sells anything you can think of. It’s huge and like a maze so we soon run out of steam but at least they managed to get some bargain trousers.

Finally we head to the Qutab Minar, in the very south of the City. This is the absolute highlight of the day – a tall Muslim victory tower and minaret dating back to the 12th century, in grounds with various temples and tombs. Although we get there late in the afternoon we spend almost 2 hours wandering, taking pics and just enjoying what is a very tranquil place despite the number of visitors.

Exhausted we head back to the hotel and try the local branch of Karims in Karol Bagh rather than heading back to Chandi Chowk again. It does good kebabs and biryani but we suspect the original is better.

Next day we have an early flight to Varanasi from Delhi domestic airport for the next leg of S&L’s
Fatehpur Sikri
trip. We’ve been pretty impressed with both the International Terminal 3 & Domestic Travel Terminal 1 which won 2nd place in Airports based on customer service – dealing with 11.4m people a year. Well done. They’re organised, clean and have good shops and facilities – part of the new modern India.

Travellers Tip:

Beware the Metro Ticket sellers who delay passing on the last 10 rupees or whatever note in the hope that as a tourist you don’t realise. And always check the published price next to the ticket window to make sure you are not overcharged – another scam they try by flagging up a higher fare then charge the real fare and pocket the difference.

Whilst the Metro is a brilliant addition to Delhi transport system, the down side is the local folk’s inability to wait to board when a train stops. Despite all the announcements and guards trying to get folk to let people off first, they can’t resist pushing on so it all ends in mayhem. We’re sure some do it on purpose as a form of game!! Anyhow, after one grope too many we decide the answer is to take advantage of
Lunch with a view - Agra
the dedicated women’s carriage at the front of every train. Still gets packed but not so mad. M has to fight with the masses in the neighbouring carriage but we have a much nicer travelling experience.

Toilets can be found at every Metro station and most tourist sites managed by “The Sulabh Toilet Complex” who charge only Rs 2 and they look after the loo’s pretty well. They do this all over India and even have a Museum in Delhi. India would be a far worse & unhygienic place to travel were it not for their efforts and we think they need a big congratulations and support.

As a general guide expect to pay Rs 20 per km for Tuk Tuks in India or go to prepaid counters in Delhi.

Varanasi

The Spice Jet flight (our first and we are impressed) to the Lal Bahadur Shastri Airport in Varanasi takes about 1 hour. We are knocked out by the new modern airport which is such a world away from the one we used to go to Nepal 5 years ago. We had pre-arranged a pick up for Rs 800 from The Ganpati Guest House – our
Ganpati Guest House Varanasi
place in the city on the river at Meer Ghat. Just as well as we have to walk the last 10 mins via back alley ways & would never have found our way without the Guest House staff who helped with the luggage and directions.

Varanasi seems to have a lot more security around especially at the old city main lanes and the Ghat entrance points. There are many reasons for this (communal tension, the large amount of gold in a Hindu Temple in the centre, the threat of terrorism etc) but is possibly comforting to visitors.

The Ganpati Guest House is a great choice of place and we would recommend it to anyone. It has a great location and an awesome vibe; feels like a really relaxed travellers pad. Very colourful, with embroidered wall hangings – elephants and Buddha’s. Staff are friendly. There is a Roof top restaurant with great views down the river – or is it up? We never did find out – too busy having fun and taking pictures.

After some lunch at the Ganpati we wander around a bit, sightseeing and take S&L to see the burning ghats, where cremations take place
Kite runners Varanasi style
in the open by the riverside. It’s all very in your face. We notice queues of bodies with their families – the more wealthy the family the more ornate the floral decorations on the body (which are then very unceremoniously dumped in the river when the body is put on the funeral pyre and become fodder for the cows!). What we are surprised to learn is that young children, women out of wedlock etc are not cremated; their bodies are dumped with a weight in the river. Wow – so much for religious fairness!

(Travellers tip: Beware the guys who claim to be from the local Hospice and try and get friendly with local information or offer to take you to a close spot where you can take pictures or get a better view – all they are after is your money. They have no credentials.)

For C & M Varanasi seems much calmer and nicer and we are sure this is because of our location – last time we stayed at the University which was a long haul away.

We negotiate a Sunset boat ride with Gopal (4 generations of boat making on the river) for
India Gate Delhi sunset
Rs 50 each. We are rowed towards the main Ghat area and await the sunset which is pretty nice.

The next big thing is the evening Aarti which lasts about 40 minutes and is very impressive (a really well choreographed performance by sadhus from the temple). It’s pretty awesome and unlike any other aarti we have witnessed in India or Nepal. We’d recommend folks to visit – it’s free although donations are welcome but there is no hard sell like Haridwar.

We head into town for dinner, after first tracking down the locally recommended rabri stall to satisfy M’s desire. Then we find a great place (Keshari Ruchikar Byanjan) doing chaat so we get a selection – aloo tikki, aloo papdi chaat, momo’s (!) – All really good and the place is packed with locals.

We have an early start to take a Sunrise boat ride – it’s cold and misty but we get a beautiful sunrise, with great pictures again, and lovely alternative views of the ghats. Then it’s back to Ganpati for breakfast and to enjoy the heat of the sun on their roof terrace.

The girls have decided to go for some retail
The best way to see Chandni Chowk, Delhi
therapy while we do some exploring of the backstreets and we meet up for lunch at Shree café just by the Man Mandir ghat which not only does great food but also has some awesome photographs taken by the owner adorning the walls.

Then it’s back to catch a cab to the train station for the overnight train to Agra – the first overnight train experience for S&L. Unfortunately they haven’t invested in the station as they had at the airport – it’s a total dump!

Agra

We arrive at 6.30am (a bit later than expected) with the driver from the Hotel waiting for us. It’s 10kms from the Cantonment station to the hotel which is only 350 mtrs from the East Gate of the Taj complex. Agra is cold in the mornings we discover, till about 10 am when the sun comes through and warms the place up to a nice 25 degrees.

Surprisingly we are upgraded to The Suite for our stay (a bit of a scam we feel as there is an extra charge to check in before 12 noon but as Louise isn’t feeling too good we go for it.) However, the
Inside the Taj complex Agra
rooms – as its two interconnected rooms - have great views of the Taj. So does the toilet!! So well worth the Rs 500 extra.

The roof top view is awesome and given that we are literally next to the Oberoi hotel which probably costs 100 times more per day we have picked a good one here. They did want Rs 100 per day per person using Wi-fi which C contested on spurious grounds and got away with – well done her.

As we are here for only 2 days and the Taj is off limits to visitors on Friday we go off to see Fathepur Sikri (FS) about 50 kms away – driver & car arranged from the hotel (Rs1100 – a good deal for 4 people). On the drive we encounter a strike rally which causes total chaos with the traffic.

Eventually we get to FS – a well preserved city by the standards of the time it was built by Akbar, considered one of the greatest Mughal Kings of India. The whole place is built in red sandstone. The design, layout and craftsmanship are beautiful and magnificent. The city was abandoned not long after
Jet Lagged at Jama Masjid Delhi
it was built and the main reason is that getting the needed water supply there proved too difficult so it was abandoned. How it remains so well preserved is a miracle in India given the state of ruin of the many other grand monuments we have visited despite “Heritage” status.

We dine at the hotel – which is ok Non Veg food, after a few Kingfishers from the local beer shop (Rs 120 a go – we believe we are being overcharged but don’t have much option – or its pay Rs180 at the Hotel). These go down well with the Navrattan & Aloo Bhujia savouries.

So it’s the big one at last – we go to see the Taj Mahal. We decide against the sunrise slot as the cold weather brings on a very heavy mist which doesn’t clear till about 8.30ish after the sun is up – so it seemed pointless.

We decide to walk in through the main entrance the South Gate as this is the one which shows the Taj in its glory as you enter through the gate archway. Entry is Rs 250 pp for foreigners but there is a local Tax
Kimonos at the Jama Masjid, Delhi
of Rs 500 per person for foreigners only – so Rs 750 in all. What one gets as a benefit is a free trip to the toilets (wow – Indian style value for money?).

The Taj is simply magnificent as usual & for the girls we hope well worth the wait. One can only wonder and admire the architecture, the symmetry and sheer craftsmanship that make this a true marvel in marble.

The history is quite simple – it’s a symbol of love from the then king Shah Jahan to his wife Mumtaz who dies in childbirth (her 14th so they were busy!)and this is his tribute to her. Both the King and Mumtaz are buried below the Taj – where visitors now can’t enter.

After two hours of admiring the site and taking hundreds of pictures we make for some food and take some advice from our LP guide and go to the Saniya Palace Hotel roof top restaurant for some lunch as it’s supposed to have the best view of the Taj – boy were they right and the food was pretty good too (even if the alley way to the hotel is a bit
Qutab Minar Delhi
messy looking, it’s well worth a visit.) We get a great table and the whole experience was truly memorable.

Next stop Agra Fort which is about 2 kms away and given the attempts by the Agra rickshaws to try & rip us off we decide to walk – which is quite fun as you see a lot of life in this part of India – cycle rickshaws, tongas (which Sarah was not keen to try as she was concerned for the horses), new on the road battery operated mini vans seating 4, Tuk Tuks, Camels with carts ferrying people to the fort from the West Gate of the Taj etc. The number of local visitors is amazing but then again it is Saturday. The queues late pm are very long.

We cannot but marvel at the Traffic system in the country for its ability to keep going against the odds – cycles, tuk tuks, cycle rickshaws, tongas (horse drawn carts), motor bikes, scooters, cars, taxis, mini buses, large buses, lorries, double parked cars & triple parked bikes, pedestrians – all vying for the same small space in the road that was never designed to take so much traffic
Rajpath Delhi
or people and not to mention the cows, buffalos, goats (who all claim priority over the road) and yet in all our time here we have not seen one accident!! It’s chaotic but it seems to work – even when people drive down the wrong side of the road. It’s amazing that road rage isn’t prominent or the population of the country would reduce pretty rapidly.

The Fort entry is Rs 250 each again & this time we are spared the local tax of Rs 50 each as we had visited the Taj earlier. The Fort is deceptively large even though part of it is closed off and houses some army personnel. The Fort is actually another Mughal palace or city within a Fort with the usual array of inlaid audience chamber, places for the king, the queen and rooms for the servants, mosques to pray in etc. There’s some nice flower work and decorations in the marble structures.

It’s in far better shape than the Red Fort in Delhi and is getting a makeover at the moment. There are some lovely views of the Taj in the distance which make great photo opportunities. Unfortunately this is what
Sunrise boat trip - Varanasi
Shah Jahan the King who built the Taj was left with when he was imprisoned here after he was overthrown by his son Aurangzeb.

We manage eventually to get a reasonable Tuk Tuk guy to take us back to the East Gate for a reasonable – if inflated Rs 80 but a far cry from the Rs 200 to 400 we were being asked for!!

The sunset doesn’t seem too good and we are not sure where we could get a good view of this over the Taj so we head “home” to the Taj Plaza for a night in as we have to get up at 3.45 am to catch our train to Jaipur….

Early morning wakeup to visit the Taj Mahal at sunrise. Driven to Taj by Vijay who met up with a local guide. Beautiful clear morning, cool and misty. Many small fires alongside road, people slowly waking up, all the images fascinating. So many cows and dogs, alongside the wild pigs, jostling for space with the tuk tuk and the cars.

Arrived at the ticket office and immediately hassled by small children selling snow globes with the Taj Mahal inside and colourful pens, mirrors and key rings. Joe warmed to one little boy, age 12, who, despite his persistent sales pitch, remained charming and friendly, so much so that Joe sought him out at the end of our tour and bought an elephant key-ring from him.



We took a form of golf caddy to the entrance of the Taj and queued for 10 minutes before entering the first gate. The sense of anticipation from all the tourists around us was clearly apparent as all knew how close we were to see one of the most famous monuments in the world and now one of the new seven wonders.



Our guide was
The Children by the Taj's Royal Gate
entertaining and recalled the love story of the palaces conception; a vision realised by Shah Jahan in memory of his wife who bore him 14 children, sadly dying in childbirth of their 14th child. Taking 20 years to build the Taj Mahal is truly a vision of his love.



On entering the main gate leading to the Taj, the famous image of the narrow lines of water leading up to the monument is divine. The Taj looks perfect and unspoilt. The white marble transparent with the early morning sunlight. The architecture is simple yet intricate, every archway carved with the influence of the east.



We strolled around the exterior of the Taj and savoured the moment. Even Joe appeared subdued by the occasion of the monument, although his description of it being ‘beautiful and white’ slightly under-sells the visit!



After all posing on ‘the’ lady Diana seat we continued to explore the building and grounds, reluctantly returning to our guide who as keen to move on to the next great site, The Agra Fort.





The Agra Fort is a red sand-stone, imposing building clinging to the
A hole in Agra fort courtesy of the British Army
side of the hill round Agra, overlooking the mirage of the Taj Mahal which sits on the bank of the river. The exterior is austere and overpowering compared to the simplicity and pure colour of the Taj but inside the fort holds great beauty and intricate design. Built as the seat and strong hold for the Mughal Empire in 1565, the fort took 8 years to build.

Two memorable aspects of the Agra fort are the deep wells, designed so the Emperors could sit during the warm summer months near to the water and the amazing views of the Taj from the royal balconies.





After a lunch and recharge of the batteries we headed out at 4.30pm to drive to the opposite bank of the river to watch the sunset next to the Taj Mahal. We parked and walked through a small rural village, small, dirty children running barefoot alongside us. Down a lane we arrived at the banks of the river as the sun began to set. Joe sat on a bench with Vijay, our driver, and chatted like two old friends. It is amazing how children can converse with any man, no
The Taj at sunset
matter what language or status in society. Joe recalled who his friends were in the UK and told Vijay about his dog. We all had time alone as the beauty of the sun setting silenced the moment. An old khaki tent housed the police, although their role down by the banks of the river was not so clear. They to appeared extremely relaxe



We headed back to the hotel, through the very busy traffic of Agra.



Alice and Hanna had displayed interest to the wife of our home stay about Henna and having their hands decorated. While we were out she purchased some henna tubes and offered to decorate the girls’ hands. We sat for the next hour with both girls patiently having their hands decorated. The lady was very kind and explained how her two sons were now grown up and she liked to ‘take care’ of her guests. Jerry and Joe had gone off to have some quiet time so it was a real mother daughter moment sitting with another mother who had a big heart.

She had also arranged for me to have have a head massage by an elderly lady who lived nearby. The lady was about 80 years old and appeared very frail but proceeded to ferociously ‘massage’ my head using a combination of slaps and flicks ! At one point I felt hysterical with laughter and couldn’t stop laughing as I could see Hanna out of the corner of my eye also laughing. The lady charged about one pound fifty for the head massage which was a new experience for me ….

King Akbar's meeting room
We rose at 7am today and had breakfast in the home-stay dining room. The owner was regaling stories of the previous night when some young female guests had tried to sneak out and meet some boys them had met on the train; an activity the owner clearly very much disapproved of.



Vijay arrived at 8am and we set off through the busy streets of an already-awoken Agra. Driving west, we passed a number of military facilities, with their gate guards of old tanks and aircraft looking rather forlorn in the morning rush. Once out of the city, the congestion lightened a little, but still the every present characteristics of Indian driving conditions remained. Whilst they have retained from the colonial days the steering wheel on the right, driving on the left is clearing more of a guideline rather than the law. Sitting in the front, it is interesting to say the least to see a tractor with a huge trailer overloaded with some farm produce coming towards us (in the outside lane). The prodigious use of the horn and flashing lights (nobody dips headlights; always on full beam) would get you beaten up in UK. Perhaps the Italians
The Palace
would be the only Europeans with a kindred appreciation of active road ‘participation’.



We arrived at Fatebar Sigri, a huge castle / palace / temple built in the 1500s when most of Europe was still wallowing around in mud. The ruler at the time was from the Persian Dynasties, so the predominate religion was Islam. However, the Great Akbar was a religious tolerant and so allowed, and indeed encouraged the other great religions. To reinforce his view, Akbar had taken three wives; one Christian from Goa, one Hindu from Agra and one Moslem from Persia. (However he also had around 300 concubines, all guarded by an army of eunuchs.) The palace contained three mini-palaces in which the three wives were housed, along with a number of other buildings where his advisors would meet. Attached to the palace was a Mosque where even to day the faithful and the gullible come to pray and offer wishes (for a fee). Apparently the last celebrity to visit was Carla Bruni (current wife of the former French president Sarkosi).



We returned to the car at around midday and set off again. Our aim was to get to the
The 'step well'
National park before nightfall; however Vijay wanted to show us a ‘step well’ that was slightly off the beaten track and bereft of foreign visitors. The structure was amazing; with a huge hole in the ground being lines with steps to allow the locals to get down to the water table level without the use of ropes and buckets. The well also functioned as a meeting place and a forum for the people to meet the local leader.



We climbed back into the car and continued our journey; arriving at the ‘resort’ hotel. After a slight delay we were shown to our rooms and had an early night. It is amazing how tired we are even though we spend a huge amount of time sitting down in the car.

Aarti
The main Ganga aarti
Varanasi or Banaras or Kashi is heart of Indian religious culture and also one of oldest cities in the world, right along with Damascus, Jerusalem, Luxor etc. The city is on banks of Holy river Ganga, and is a unique place where Ganga flows east - west. The city is one of major centers of Hindu religion, and also has one of the major Buddhist centers Sarnath nearby.
Day 1



We reached Mughal Sarai station by an overnight train from Kolkata. Surprisingly the train was on time. Its about an hour drive from Varanasi city and Banaras Hindu University where we were staying. First item of day was breakfast. We were there to attend a conference, so the breakfast was arranged there. It was a completely yummy typical Indian breakfast of aalu puri. I loved it! Then we checked into our room, took nice shower and were ready for lunch, again at conference. Lunch was another yummy spread of typical Indian food. I had the best ever hot naans and found it really hard to control overeating. Dessert was another out of world experience. I knew that next few days are going to be all about food now!
Kathak performance

In the evening we took a boatride on Ganga to see the famous aarti on its shores. The shore is lined with ghats, and old palaces. These belonged to different kings and queens that ruled this area and were used as bathing places for them. The grandeure still remains though the bulidings have mostly become khandahar. The aarti was indeed magnificant with many priests performing the ritual in sync. For dinner we were taken to the palace of last raja of Banaras. There we were surprised by a dance performace by grandsons of leading Kathak (Indian classical dance from the north) guru Birju maharaj. The performance was really good. After the performance we had another delicious spread for dinner.
Day 2


Today after another delicious breakfast we wanted to go to Sarnath. Its one of the leading center for Buddhists with many temples and remains of ancient monasteries. We asked around on how to get there and most people said take auto - 20 km, too much for that, or take taxi - too expensive. So we decided to try our luck with bus. We were quite lucky and immediately found a bus that took us to Sarnath. Once
Sarnath
off the bus, we immediately spotted a store that was selling banarasi print clothes from local producers (we will later find out that it was a common site in Sarnath). We went into the store and did some shopping. I was quite impressed by prices and quality of saari and suits there.

Then we got started on seeing the temples and ruins. There were temples from all Buddhist countries - Thailand, Japan, Korea etc, each carrying its own unique flavour of the country. Though the ruins were quite in ruin 😞. They were clearly not maintained. There were some signs saying don't walk on walls etc., but no one to enforce and no one following them. While we were there we saw a ground of school kids come in, and they were walking / running all over the ruins. It made me so angry, such a place in Europe would be thoroughly preserved and maintained as a major tourist attraction. Not here.
Day 3



Today I had to visit some of my relatives who greated us with even more amazing food. I had not expected this trip to be a food galore! Then we thought of seeing
Temple
Thai temple with giant Buddha
some of the great temples in the city and walking along the ghats of Ganga. We expected to see lot of activity on the ghat as shown in TV. But we were very disappointed. There was hardly any activity on the ghats in afternoon, it probably increased in evening. The place was full of vendors asking if we wanted to take boat ride, and it was sadly also one of the dirtiest places I had seen. I could not stand more than 30 min of walk there. Though seeing shooting of a Tamil film brought some excitement.

Then we tried to go to 3 temples -

The main Kashi Vishwanath temple, but we told that you will have to leave everything outside and there might be line and crowd there, plus need to be aware of pick pockets. So we decided to skip it. I am not fan of crowds, and I did not want to get robbed at a temple!

The sankat mochan temple of Hanuman - We went upto the entrance, there was not too much crowd, still I somehow did not feel like going inside there also. The atmosphere was just not what you

would want at a temple.

Finally we decided to go to the temple inside Banaras Hindu University. It was a nice small temple, with little crowd and much better ambiance. So we decided to go in there. The place reminded us of BITS, Pilani campus temple and also C'not in our campus. After the temple, remembering old times we had some noodles at a small cafe outside. It was quite cold already, so we just walked back to our room and called it a day.

Sikandra, Agra, India
Geo: 27.1661, 77.9865

Beat the noise today by waking up at 5AM and getting picked up by my driver (who only speaks broken English) at 6AM to avoid the Delhi morning traffic. Just before Agra we stopped to check out the giant Mausoleum area of Sikandra built ""by"" and for the Mogul Akbar.
In the afternoon I went to see the Taj Mahal. And even though people were stepping on top of each other for the picture-postcard photo it was surprisingly enjoyable and a very impressive building. Although the interior was rather small and simplistic. Nevertheless, definitely a highlight of my trip!

Vermied den Feuerwerks-Wecker heute indem ich bereits um 5 Uhr aufstand und von meinem Fahrer (der leider kaum Englisch spricht) um 6 Uhr abgeholt wurde, um Delhi's Morgenverkehr aus dem Weg zu gehen. Kurz vor Agra hielten wir am gigantischen Mausoleum des Mogul Akbar in Sikandra. Am Nachmittag schaute ich mir dann das Taj Mahal an. Und trotz der Menschenmassen und des chaotischen Gerangels um das Postkarten-Photo war es doch ganz schoen dort. Und das Bauwerk ziemlich beeindruckend! Obwohl das Innere des Mausoleums doch ueberraschend klein und Von eher schlichter Natur gestaltet ist. Trotzdem, definitiv ein Highlight meiner Reise!

3.Jaisalmer (22)
Beste mensen,

De vorige keer ben ik geeindigd bij de kamelensafari in Jaisalmer. We zijn toen s'middags met de auto richting woestijn vertrokken en toen we daar aankwamen stonden de kamelen en hun drijvers al klaar. De rugzakken werden op de kamelen gebonden en toen mochten we beide opstappen. Even goed vasthouden en hop; daar stonden we dan, midden in de woestijn op een kameel! We zouden voor 2 uren richting de zandduinen rijden, om dan vanaf hier van de zonsondergang te genieten. Het was toch weer eventjes raar, zo op een kameel door de woestijn. Tijdens de rit naar de duinen voelden we het ook goed in onze beenspieren! Daar aangekomen waren zigeuners van een nabijgelegen dorp aan het zingen voor geld. Klonk gezellig dus toch even kijken. Het was best leuk, zelfs de baby's waren opgemaakt! Achteraf wilden ze voor een paar centjes met ons op de foto en zo gezegd zo gedaan. Hierna kwam nog een verkoper langs met koude biertjes. Hier zeiden we natuurlijk geen nee tegen en met een biertje in de hand hebben we genoten van de mooie zonsondergang. Nadat de zon onder was heeft onze gids nog voor ons gezongen en even later
3.Jaisalmer (23)
kwam een jongen van een dorpje dat onder aan de duinen lag ons eten brengen. Het zag er allemaal wat onhygienisch uit maar het had heerlijk gesmaakt, en achteraf hebben we ook geen buikpijn of niks gehad ( tot nu toe nog helemaal niet...ff afkloppen ) later die avond heeft onze gids ons de stretchers klaar gezet en onder een mooie sterrenhemel zijn we lekker in slaap gevallen. De ochtend erna zijn we opgestaan en niet veel later kwam een jongetje ons onbijt brengen. Dit bestond uit geroosterd brood met jam en een stapeltje biscuits en een paar hard gekookte eieren. Niet slecht voor een woestijn ontbijt! Een wilde hond die tijdens de nacht in de buurt van ons heeft geslapen heeft ook mogen meegenieten van de biscuits. Na het ontbijt zijn we met de kamelen terug gereden richting de auto en zijn we weer terug gegaan richting Jaisalmer. Hier hebben we nog even mogen douchen in het hotel en vanuit daar hebben we een riksjaw gepakt om naar de bus te gaan die ons naar Jodhpur zou brengen. Eenmaal aangekomen zagen we dat de bus een oud wrak was maar wat kan je anders verwachten van een busrit voor
3.Jaisalmer (25)
2 personen van 270 km voor 7 euro. We hadden al veel meegemaakt qua bussen in Cambodja en laos, maar dit sloeg alles. De bus werd gewoon prakkie vol geduwd, er zaten complete families op de grond met hun babys en op een 1 persoons plaats zaten soms wel 3 personen. Alsof dit niet genoeg was ree de chauffeur ook nog eens alsof zijn leven ervanaf hing! We waren het achteraf dus ook helemaal eens met de lonely planet travel tip om zoveel mogelijk met de trein te doen! 6 uren later en gelukkig nog steeds onder de levenden zijn we aangekomen bij het stadje Jodhpur. Hier hebben we een riksjaw genomen naar een hotel en zijn toen lekker naar bed gegaan. De ochtend erna zijn we opgestaan en hebben we een ontbijt genomen op het dakterras van ons hotel. Nu zagen we pas hoe mooi Jodhpur is, alle gebouwen zijn blauw geverfd. Ze noemen het ook de blauwe stad. Ook hadden we een super uitzicht op het fort, dit was enorm groot en volgens Engelse backpackers die naast ons zaten zeker een bezoekje waard.Na het eten zijn we dit dan ook gaan bezichtigen. Wat ons vooral hier opviel was
3.Jaisalmer (28)
dat alles enorm schoon was. Dit was de eerste keer dat we dit zagen in India en we waren dus ook erg onder de indruk. Steeds als we een fort bezichtigen deden we een audiotour en hier dus ook weer. Deze was erg duidelijk gesproken en voor de afwisseling ook eens erg boeiend.Na het fort hebben we nog even de klokkentoren en de dierentuin bezocht. S'avonds hebben we lekker niks gedaan en zijn we op tijd naar bed gegaan omdat we de volgende ochtend de trein naar Jaipur zouden hebben. We hadden hiervoor de sleeper class geboekt ( dit is de goedkoopste klasse ) en ondanks de lage verwachting hiervan is ons dit erg goed bevallen, we hadden genoeg ruimte en het was een stuk comfortabeler als de bus! Wel kwam af en toe eens een lief muisje kijken of we wat lekkers voor haar hadden maar hier hadden we geen problemen mee! Eenmaal aangekomen in Jaipur hebben we een rikshaw naar het ""nr1 hotel"" van de Lonely planet genomen, wat net buiten de stad lag. Hier aangekomen hadden we geluk. Ze hadden ze nog net 1 kamer over! Zoals de lonely planet beloofde waren het ook erg mooie kamers,
3.Jaisalmer (34)
en voor de 1e keer hadden we weer eens ""oregami"" handdoeken gevouwen in zwaantjes! Na eventjes genoten te hebben van de kamer zijn we naar het dakterras gegaan en hebben we hier lekker gegeten. Daarna zijn we nog even de stad ingegaan en heb ik me een zonnebril op sterkte laten maken. ( Dit wilde ik al lang laten doen en wist dat dit in India goedkoop zou zijn. ) Ik heb er uiteindelijk 28 euro voor betaald! S'avonds nog even terug gegaan naar het dakterras en daar nog lekker samen een biertje gedronken. Voor de dag erna hadden we een rickshaw besteld die ons de hele dag rond zou rijden naar de diverse bezienswaardigheden. Dit kost je hier ongeveer 7 euro. We hebben eerst het observatorium bezocht.Dit is een stuk land waar een bekende astronoom een aantal instrumenten heeft gebouwd waarmee je de precieze tijd kunt zien en de afstand van de hemellichamen kunt berekenen. Interessant, maar niet mijn hobby! Daarna hebben we nog 2 tempels bezocht ( waaronder ook de monkeytemple ) en toen zijn we de stad uit gereden en hebben we het beroemde amber fort bezocht, dit was echt de moeite waard, zowel van buiten als
3.Jaisalmer (84)
van binnen zag het er erg indrukwekkend uit! Na een aantal uurtjes hier te zijn geweest zijn we nog naar de Jal Mahal gereden.Dit is een tempel die onder water staat in en meertje en dit ziet er erg mooi uit. Daarna zijn we terug gereden naar het hotel en hebben we een massagesalon gebeld om ons op te pikken en eens lekker te verwennen! Na helemaal relaxt terug te zijn gekomen hebben we bij het hotel de bus naar Agra geboekt en zijn we daarna lekker gaan slapen. De dag erna zijn we met de bus naar Agra gereden. Dit was een trip van ongeveer 5-6 uur. In Agra ligt de Taj Mahal en in de lonely planet lazen we dat er een paar hotels waren die vanaf hun dakterras hierop uitkeken. Die wilden we dan natuurlijk ook graag hebben! Na 2 volle hotels te hebben bezocht hadden we er eentje gevonden en het was super!! Je kon gewoon een van de wereldwonders zien vanuit je hotel terwijl je geniet van een hapje en een drankje! Wat wil je nog meer ?! De dag erna zijn we om 6 uur opgestaan zodat we hem konden bezichtigen tijdens de zonsopgang.
3.Jaisalmer (74)
( Dit is ook het minst drukke tijdstip ) Het verhaal achter de Taj Mahal is dat keizer Shan Jahan deze heeft gebouwd voor zijn 3e vrouw, welke overleden was tijdens de bevalling van hun 14e kind. Hij was hier zo kapot van dat zijn haar binnen 1 nacht grijs was. De bouw van de Taj Mahal heeft in totaal 22 jaar geduurt en niet lang nadat hij klaar was, is de keizer door zijn zoon in de gevangenis gezet waar hij enkel nog door een klein raampje naar zijn creatie kon kijken. Hier is hij 6 jaar later ook overleden. Een treurig verhaal, maar gelukkig staat er nu wel een bijzonder mooie tempel. We hebben hier een audio tour gedaan en hebben in totaal 3 uurtjes rond gelopen. S'middags hebben we weer een ricksjaw gehuurd en de baby Taj bezocht ( een kleine replica ) en nog wat andere tombes in Agra. Hierna zijn we nog naar de zonsondergang op de Taj Mahal gaan kijken vanaf de rivier. Hiervoor hadden we samen met een paar andere backpackers een bootje gehuurd. S'avonds laat hebben we de nachttrein naar Varenasi genomen. Varenasi is bekend als 1 van de 7 heilige steden
3.Jaisalmer (87)
voor Hindoes. Pelgrims komen hiernaartoe om hun zonden weg te wassen in de rivier Ganges en om hun dierbaren naast de rivier te cremeren. Een bijzondere aangelegenheid dus. Hierover in de volgende blog meer. Bedankt voor al jullie leuke reacties en tot de volgende keer!

Groeten Roy

on the way to Agra
The wake up call was for 6:45am, but someone was a little to full of energy and woke up at 6am. She even skipped breakfast, just wanting to hit the road asap. We repacked our bags so that all we were taking to Agra was our carry on suitcase to hold our one nights clothes. We got a lot of double takes from our driver and bell boys when we showed up with the one small bag. We are staying at the same hotel in Delhi on Friday night, so we decided we might as well store them there instead of carrying them all over the place. Our driver showed up on time just before 8am and we hit the road. The distance is just over 200km to Agra from Delhi, but for some reason, everyone keeps quoting 5 hours for the driving time. It was a fine road, paved, but, you can imagine the traffic. Actually, if you haven't been outside north america, then you can't, it's super crazy. It took a good hour just to get out of Delhi, and when we reached the outskirts of Agra, another hour to get to the hotel. In between, it was trucks,
on the way to Agra
cars, motorcycles, bicycles, walkers, and the two wheel taxi's that I have forgotten the name. They have a festival here called Dhaliwal. It a hindu festival and is a big 4 day holiday here that takes up most of a week with different kinds of celebration. One constant is the fireworks each night from every part of the city. When we arrived in Delhi, we were wondering why it was so cloudy, and were told it was the fireworks. We doubted that story, just like the ""humidity"" in Hong Kong, but it turned out to be pretty accurate. So, today, as we drove, they have something called brother/sister day, but it's got another name in Hindi. It's a day where sisters go visit their brothers. So what we eneded up seeing on our drive was tons of women in some really happenin' sari's, on the backs of motorcycles. Once we got to Agra, it was to the hotel, a quick clean, and then waiting for the guide to show up. We had a 2pm date, then it was off the the Taj Mahal. We did a quick meet and greet at 2pm, he was almost hijacked by another white couple
on the way to Agra
waiting for their Indian guide, then it was off to the Taj. It was just 10 minutes drive, and suddenly we were there at the outside gate. The first we saw was the dome, then partial building as we walked through the doors of the gate, and then..there it was. WOW!! You can build it up as much as you want, but it will always be a superstar as far as world monuments go. The guide took us to many angles before getting up close. We got a good history of the monument, and then had a tour inside to see the fake tombs. The real ones are under the floor, and there is no admittance down there. As we were leaving the inside, I looked to my side to see Penny posing for a picture with an indian woman. I asked Penny what was up, and she said the lady asked. Then, it happened just a few minutes later, another woman asked. And so it went for about an hour of walking around the Taj. If they weren't approaching to ask, they were being sneaky with their cameras. Sometimes they would pose right beside her, making it look like
Taj Mahal
she was not in the picture. She would always catch their eye and ask them to pose with her properly. A shy face at first for getting caught, they always gave her a smile, and then posed with her. You can imagine how much she loved this attention. We were done just after 5pm as the sun was pretty much done with its lighting up of the dome, so we packed up and left for the hotel. We made a short stop at the usual ""artisan"" shop for the hard sell of local merchandise, then finally, the hotel. We had a nice meal in the restaurant, then a walk around the property to see what we were missing during the day. Its dark out now, the fireworks are going steady like in Delhi, and we are pretty tired. We have a full day planned tomorrow, the Agra fort, a little place known as Fatehpur Sikri, and finally the drive back to Delhi. Let you know how it goes tomorrow!

And the Snark with a glass in its eye, dressed in gown, bands and wig, was defending a pig on the charge of deserting its sty...

I've had very strange dreams on this trip so far. Most about home, New Zealand, my dog, various friends and one or two about girls from the past. I've found some of them quite hard to deal with and process, they keep reminding me about home. The lush green hills, the wide open spaces, being able to wander off into the bush and not see anyone all day. As much as I am enjoying the adventure I am also thoroughly missing my hills and mountains back home.



Its hot. Very hot. I mention this to Isaac. ""Hmm? Its a bit warm but not that bad."" Damit. Fever. Was hoping it was just the heat and car sickness from the barreling jeep ride down from the hills of Darjeeling. I'd been feeling a bit off on the train aswell, but had just put that down to a headache from the constant sounding of the trains horn. It doesn't feel bad but it could mean trouble.



Stomach cramps. Not too bad. They only come when I stand up/sit down/lean forward/backward/roll over in my sleep/do anything. Some of them quite crippling, all I can do is stop and hold my belly.

We spent that night in a rather aweful hotel in New Jalpaiguri. Only Rs250 per night for both of us (about $6 NZ) but having some sort of party and shouting kick off at 9pm and go till midnight while being eaten alive by sandflies and mosquitos AND having mild food poisoning was one I would rather just forget than 'put down to experience'. Itwas quite a pleasure to head off to Varenasi the next morning.

We only have one day here really, but it has brought back somuch, and I'm feeling quite emotional. Some of my strongest memories of Dawn on our previous trip were here, especially at the burning ghats. This is where bodies are blessed, burned on the riverside and then given back to mother Gange. I don't think Isaac likes it much at all. But it reminds me of how univolved we are in so many things back home. In western culture we seldom look after the body of a deceased loved one ourselves, and many of the processes that take place are done by others, out of sight. I'm not saying this is a bad thing nessecerily, just very different. In the culture here, the family takes care of almost everything, from start to finish. The enbalming, the dressing, the transport to the ghats, then the burning and finally passing the remains to the river. However, only the men are present at the burning, so there ya go. Another big difference.



We met a young guy, Babu, who offered to take us to a couple of spots around the city and for tea at his home. We accepted and this turned out to be the best thing we could have done. We learned alot about Indian silks and oils, about the buring ghats, even visited the karma sutra temple at one point. I though he'd miss pronounced it at first and didn't realise quite where we were going, but itwas certainly eye opening. We finished the day with a ceremony on the river which was nice to watch for a bit, but we were both pretty knackered and soon headed back to the hotel.

One small thing I found in Varenasi, but which I was totally stoked with, was a small tile mosaic graffiti by Space Invader, a very famous graffiti artist and I'll put up a picture when I can. Doesn't matter where yago, someones always throwin up their scribble.

I'm also losing some weight through this stomach bug. Having my stomach constantlytry to, well, purge, alongwith iregular meals (sometimes one a day due to traveling) and then huge meals when we do, my cramps are also pretty bad.

Well, time is almost up, only got 5 minutes left so this will have to be all for now, but I'll write again when I can, and hopefully text a few people when I'm back in Kolkatta. My phone doesn't seem to be working in Uttar Pradesh.



Traveller out.

sarnath
Remember when I said we'd talk more about security? Well, let's do that now. Airports in India are even more security conscious than NYC ones. You can't get into the terminal without showing ID to friendly Indian Army dudes. Then your luggage is X-rayed and tagged. THEN you finally get to check in to get your boarding pass and seat assignment. And don't forget to put a tag on your carry-on luggage. You don't have to write anything on it, but you'll need it later. Oh, and regarding carry-on.... Don't put your extra camera batteries in your carry-on, apparently they don't like them here. Once you're checked in, it's off to security. Gents on one line, ladies on another. Why? Because everybody gets wanded and frisked, but us ladies get to be groped in private. At least we get groped by female officers. Remember the tag on your carry-on? Once it gets x-rayed, it gets stamped. And don't lose the tag, because before you get on the plane, the bag will be checked again for that stamped tag....

But once all the airport stuff was done, the flight itself was uneventful and I had a really yummy chicken roti for
sarnath
lunch. About an hour drive from the airport to the hotel, which was very pretty, but had tiny elevators. Our first stop was Sarnath, where Buddha gave his first talks. The temple is huge outside, but relatively small inside. And relatively simple. Murals of Buddha's life on the walls and Buddhist altar at one end of the temple with a monk in attendance. Outside the temple is a larger than life-size group of statues of Buddha addressing his first 5 disciples. The statues were quite colorful, and a bit garish looking to my eyes.

Our evening excursion was another optional. A rickshaw ride through Varanasi to the Ganges and then a ""river cruise"" on the Ganges.

[Before continuing, I need to discuss the timing of this trip. Unbeknownst to me (I did NO research before booking the trip), we arrived in India during a festival. For nine days, Hindus fast and make offerings to the effigies of various gods. On the ninth evening (or 10th in some places), the effigies are paraded through the streets and immersed in the Ganges. And guess what night our night in Varansi was. Yup, it was the night of the parade/immersing. Imagine
sarnath
being caught up in a combination of the Thanksgiving Day Parade, New Year's Eve in Time's Square, Rose Bowl Parade, Mardi Gras and the NYC San Gennaro festival. All at the same time. With everyone heading to the Ganges for ceremonies and nobody being very polite about getting there.]

Back to our excursion. Bus to the rickshaw line. Unlike in Delhi, where Haviva and I shared a rickshaw, this time we were separated. This meant less fun for me, since I didn't have anyone to talk to as we went. But it did have some interesting moments. Crossing into the lane of on-coming traffic to avoid the floats with the gods on them (Haviva says that was the moment she realized she wasn't in the US anymore). Dodging through revelers who seem to have no concern that a rickshaw is coming at them. Trying to take pictures of a Buddhist temple while dodging revelers and trying to hold on for dear life. Checking out the lights strung overhead and wondering what they'll look like come nightfall. The rickshaws can't go all the way to the river (unsure if that was because of the festival or is the norm), so
sarnath
we had a bit of a walk to the Ganges. A nerve-wracking walk through crowded streets, attempting to keep up with our fairly short guide. I'm pretty good at doing the bob and weave through crowds, but this tested my limits. My courage was tested even more when I saw how we had to get down to the river itself. There are steps that go down to the river. If things had been normal, this would have been no big deal. However, India had a bad monsoon season this year, and the steps were covered with mud. Three feet deep in places and very uneven. Seriously, if it had been an option, I would have said ""I'm staying here, have fun on the river, see you later."" I have an extreme fear of falling, and while Haviva and other members of our group tried to help, nothing really makes it better for me.

Eventually I made it down to our boat, an oversized rowboat. We were rowed down river to the cremation area, but fortunately, we didn't get close enough for me to actually see burning bodies. Or maybe we were and I just looked the other way. I
buddhist altar at sarnath
have mixed feelings about this. While I found the scenery around the river interesting, I feel there is something wrong about turning cremation pyres into a tourist attraction. I don't really want people wandering into my funeral. At least our group was respectful and did not take pictures. Unlike others who we saw on the water. We sat there a long time, partially because a whole crowd of people came down to the river carrying a body of a holy man. We watched as they poured water on the body and then unwrapped all the garlands he had been draped in. Finally, a whole bunch of them (a WHOLE bunch) of them got into another boat with the body and rowed out to the middle of the river, where they let the body slide into the river.

After a while we went back up river to watch another ceremony, a thanksgiving one performed every night at sunset by a set of priests. Unfortunately, there were a lot of boats there at this point and we were pretty far away, so I got kind of bored. I was also dreading the fact that I was going to have to navigate
buddha
those muddy steps back UP to the street. Because of the festival, the pier area around the thanksgiving ceremony was packed, reminding me of 4th of July fireworks on the Hudson.

The walk back up the stairs was just as bad as I had dreaded. Worse actually. This was where our tour guide failed, in my opinion. He almost lost me and Haviva. I was way far back behind the group, trying to inch my way along the mud. Haviva went ahead of me, up the clearer steps to try and catch him to get him to wait for me. However, he didn't stop in the first clear area that there was, but rather went back through the market stalls almost back to the main street. I caught up with Haviva on the steps (thanks to a very kind Israeli gentleman) to find that she'd pulled something in her foot. We hobbled up the stairs together and luckily managed to wend our way the same way our group had gone. Gotta tell you, I was definitely panicking at this point. But it was worse for Haviva, she had to deal with the pain in her foot for the rest
sarnath buddha closeup
of the trip.

Our rickshaw drivers were waiting for us in a little ""parking lot"". Since we hadn't tipped them on the way to the river, they made sure that the same passenger ended up with the driver they had on the way to in. About 1/2 of the group made it out no problem, but then the rest of us got caught in another god effigy float traffic jam. We have to have sat in the alley for at least 10 minutes. Once we got out, the trip out was even more hair-raising then the trip in had been. Even more people on the streets, most going opposite us and not caring where anyone else was going. I did enjoy riding along the streets that had the colored lights overhead, but riding through the unlit streets was a bit scary. But eventually we reconnected with the rest of our group at our bus and made our way back to the hotel. Where we got to listen to the festivities going on all night.

Jaipur - kralovsky palac
Cestou do Agry jsme se zastavili v Jaipuru, hlavnim meste Rajastanu. Jaipuru se take prezdiva ruzove mesto, protoze budovy v jeho historickem centru maji naruzovelou barvu. Je to velke a hlucne mesto, ale jeho jadro rozhodne stoji za videni. Krome kralovskeho palace a haremu je v nem observator, ve ktere jsou napr. nejvetsi slunecni hodiny na svete s presnosti na dve sekundy.

Do Agry jsme se tentokrat presunuli dennim autobusem, takze jsme prijeli az po 18h. U busu se nas ochotne ujal ridic riksi a nabizel, ze nas odveze do ""very cheap and beautiful hotel"". Svezli jsme se, uvideli a ubytovali se. Pokoj je spis prumerny, ale z terasy na strese je videt primo na Taj Mahal, coz je k nezaplaceni.

Taj, ktery je neustale v oblezeni turistu, jsme navstivili dnes. Zahranicni turiste plati do indickych pamatek vzdy vyssi vstupne nez mistni, ale tady je ten rozdil az sprosty. Mistni plati 25 Rs a cizinci 750 Rs. Pres vsechna drobna uskali je ale navsteva Taj Mahalu neuveritelny zazitek. Jak kazdy vi, Taj Mahal byl postaven jako mauzoleum pro nejoblibenejsi zenu mughalskeho krale, ktera mu za 19 let spolecnoho zivota porodila 14 deti. Pro nas byla novinka zjisteni, ze puvodne
Taj Mahal
mel na protejsim brehu reky stat jeste jeden monument. Mel mit cernou barvu a slouzit jako hrobka pro krale. K realizaci tohoto projektu ale nedoslo, protoze jeho syn se bal, ze stavba druheho Taje by zruinovala imperium {asi mel pravdu}, takze otce radeji zamknul v pevnosti a po smrti ho ulozil po boku jeho milovane zeny.

Nedari se nam pridat fotky, pokusime se je dodat zpetne.

The Taj
Bench where Lady Diana sat for photo op some years back.
We’ve enjoyed our short stay in India.



One of the advantages of traveling for an extended period of time is that you may find yourself wanting to change some of the plans you have made for one reason for another and discover that this is something you can do without remorse. You’ve got the time and the initiative, so you just make it happen.



Case in point; we arrived in Kathmandu over a month ago and spent four nights there before departing for other parts of Nepal and then returned for a few nights at the end. Truth is, we didn’t care for Kathmandu and were rather blunt about it in an earlier blog.



So, after we finished the incredible country of Bhutan, we were supposed to return to Kathmandu for another four nights. Neither one of us could imagine going back to Kathmandu because frankly we had seen enough.



After our Kathmandu experience, we were scheduled to fly to Delhi, India so we decided to bail early on Kathmandu and spend all the extra days in India. So we’ve had a whirlwind five nights zipping around a small
Heading to temple
part of India called the Golden Triangle, which includes Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.



In general, Asia is dirtier than the rest of the world, which is a kind description. It is a third world country and there are different expectations. There is a travel blog forum question about which country most people think is the dirtiest and India usually ends up first or second from most people’s point of view. We won’t argue, but coming here shortly after being in Nepal we will tell you we have personally encountered less dust and we are pleased that the roads are well paved and do not have large potholes. In a manner of speaking, the dirt and garbage are better contained to a small degree from the small sampling we’ve viewed.



We will not pretend to have any substantial knowledge about India. This has been a whirlwind 5-day trip, so we have a few impressions but few facts to share.



We flew into Delhi and spent the night in a wonderful B&B in New Delhi. We were only overnighting, so we arrived after dark and left in the morning. If you get to
Marble entry
amazing carving
Delhi, India please check it out. It was extremely comfortable and the owners gracious. You can private message us for more information. From there we headed to Agra to see the world famous Taj Mahal.





Agra





The voyage to Agra was a most pleasant one. This is largely due to the fact that we got to ride on the new expressway that has only been open for a few months. It’s about 220 KM to Agra from Delhi and we found ourselves riding on a road three-lanes wide with almost no traffic. This is because this highway is a toll road and a twice as costly as the old road. Good for us—we were able to make it to Agra in less than 3 hours. The gentleman navigating the road for us remarked that the road was “an Indian driver’s dream.” It is interesting to note that we asked how many people lived in Agra, and were told that it is not a very big city as it only has about a million and a half people. Being from the U.S., this qualifies as a large city. In India….no.

We’ve always wanted to see the Taj Mahal as it is an architectural marvel, an iconic photo and one of those places you’d just like to see for yourself. But, you’ve got to ask yourself, how good can this be? It is just a building.



Here’s where the “Grand Canyon” theory kicks in. You can tell people just how great and beautiful a place is and even show them pictures, but the only way to truly appreciate it is to be there, because once you take in the view, it sinks in……



It is stunning. Standing looking at this you are breathless. It is mesmerizing, surreal, ethereal…..pick your adjective. It is magnificent. It was built for love and it shows.



We were so enamored with it the first day that we went back the next morning for sunrise. And then we were even more impressed. As the story goes, an Indian mogul king in the mid 17th century built this place in memory of his wife. It’s exterior is built completely of white marble, which had to be brought from about 300 km away and was completed in about
Ablutions after prayers
At the sacred pool.
20 years. It has withstood the test of time and it’s relief carvings in its marble are simply amazing, given the time period it was constructed.



The white marble used in creating this magnificent structure came from several hundred kilometers away. The etchings carved into the marble and the inlay of other exotic stones makes one stare in awe. It is in contrast to the red sandstone used for the entrance gates on the 42- acre compound.



Agra is also home to an impressive fort that has sixteen palaces and has been the home to six Moghul Emperors. A short distance outside of Agra we visited the UNESCO World Heritage site of Fatehpur Sikri. Both these sites deserve a look.





Jaipur



When we decided to spend a few days in India, we allowed a travel agency to arrange the trip as we were in Bhutan and had spotty internet. We didn’t have enough time to mess with this ourselves. They had us also visiting the city of Jaipur. Our initial reaction was, why? We had never heard of this city and frankly were not sure what
Enchanting eyes
to expect. We usually do some research about where we are about to visit, but in this case seeing as how it was arranged and kind of a last moment thing, we went in without any knowledge. Once again we asked how many people lived in lived in this city we were about to visit and were told over three million. Amazing, seeing as how there are not that many cities in the U.S. that have this many people. But then again, this is India.



Our drive from Agra to Jaipur was uneventful. Perhaps we are getting used to the way the people in this country navigate the roadways. We were on a “toll road” and literally saw vehicles traveling the wrong way on a mostly divided highway. We enjoyed watching the goats, sheep, cows, water buffalo and dromedaries wandering along the roadside and occasionally walking across the highway. In India, one simply navigates around the animals as if they don’t notice. Women even herd goats across the road while vehicles whiz by at 80 kph. We chuckle as we ride along, as this would never happen in the U.S. The thing that puzzles us the most
Glamor in the Palace
is pedestrians who walk down the middle of one lane of the highway rather casually ….or walk across. It is a puzzle to us. Here it is simply the norm.



Jaipur was a most amazing city, not only in size, but also for the amount of things to take in and see. We literally only had one day here, but tried to make the most of it. The Amber Fort and Palace were unique, in that they had some really nice views from atop the local hills. The Jaigarh Fort contained the world’s largest cannon on wheels and also was designed so that arrows could be fired through strategically placed holes in the fort’s walls, not to mention that it also has the capability to dump hot oil on would-be attackers.



In the city itself, the Jantar Mantar Observatory was pretty cool as it contained instruments designed and built in the 18th century to determine the local time (a sun dial) and other designs allowed the telling of the sign of the zodiac (quite important in the Hindu religion) and the position of the North Star. Not impressed yet? Well consider this……all these instruments
Beaded Shoes
were made on a grand scale and placed together in the middle of the city for all to see. Turns out the king at the time was quite the astronomy/astrology kind of guy. Imagine a sun dial that is at minimum about thirty meters across and keeps the local time to the second….not bad.



No trip to Jaipur is apparently complete unless you take some time to visit the spice market. So of course…..we did. There we found the local merchants hawking all the traditional spices like turmeric, coriander and the like, along with others who sold bangles and tobacco and tea. The squalor was a bit much, but it made for interesting photos.



Delhi



We got up on our fifth day and basically headed for the airport; next stop, Delhi. A city of over 14 million or so, depending on who you ask. Nonetheless, a large place indeed. One of the first things you discover is that there is “Old Delhi” and “New Delhi.” New Delhi was built by the British, which essentially means that it came into existence sometime before 1940 or so, seeing as how India gained their
High fashion
independence in the late 1940’s.



At any rate, arriving at the Delhi airport in the early afternoon with only that one day to look around doesn’t leave much time, but we still got out and took a quick look. We drove around a little down embassy row and also saw the presidential palace, which is quite the structure.



Next we went to see Old Delhi and the market, which was definitely pressing our luck considering that just the day before we had seen our fair share of the dirty unkempt marketplace in Jaipur. Well, Old Delhi pretty much did the trick. The sights, sounds and smells were a bit much and we didn’t really enjoy much of it. It was like going to the corner of Squalor and Garbage Streets, then turning right and stepping right into it. This country simply has too many people hanging out in too small a place. Crowded shops selling everything imaginable and garbage everywhere. We wish that they had a better way of taking care of this issue, but without garbage cans and a way to move it away, the task is just too grand.


Lines and designs

Fleeing Old Delhi, we went to the largest Sikh temple in India and were mesmerized by the sight. It was grand. The music, the prayer and the reverence that was paid to this place was amazing. The temple also feeds anyone who shows up and has plenty of volunteers to make this happen. We toured the kitchen and you’re not likely to see pots full of tea and bread making operation this size very often. We were told that they feed people each and every day for about 15 hours a day. The pool on the site was considered holy and could cure diseases of the skin as well. All in all one of the better temples we’ve seen on this voyage.



India is a great place to people watch. We hope you enjoy the photos.





Places we stayed:

Soi Bed & Breakfast- New Delhi

Radisson- Agra

SMS Hotel- Jaipur

Uppal- Delhi- very close to the airport, perfect for an early flight

Bob coxwains for us on a Ganges boat trip
We'd heard lots about India, good and bad, and so it was with some trepidation that we crossed the border at Sunauli into Uttar Pradesh. It turned out that the first challenge was locating immigration amongst the stalls, people and general chaos of the town. We found it eventually, hidden behind a curtain beside a small sign. Rather than the queues we'd had in other countries, we seemed to be the only people bothering with formalities, and having got stamped, we officially entered the country.

It was never going to be a great journey down to Varanasi, but suffice to say, we didn't get much sleep on a packed bus with rickety upright seats chugging along bumpy unsealed roads. On the rare occasion one of us managed to nod off, we were usually rudely reawakened with a jolt as we met yet another pothole. Fortunately, in the earlier part of the journey at least, there was plenty to look at with every village we past through having assembled lights, colourful statues and sound systems to celebrate the ten day long festival of Durga Puja, one of the biggest festivals in the country, celebrating the Hindu Goddess Durga. There were also
Varanasi Streets
various stops where we got to sample a whole new range of street food. Chai (masala tea) is ubiquitous at 5 rupees for a small glass, and samosas and other lesser known fried goods also seem to crop up for the same price pretty much everywhere. Suffice to say we were suitably reassured that we would not be going hungry.

We finally got into Varanasi at about four in the morning and it was surprisingly busy with all the usual hassle that you get on arrival at a bus station in the middle of the day. We certainly didn't have any problem finding a tuk tuk to take us into the old part of town and then we took a little while negotiating our way through the labyrinth of narrow streets past sleeping cows, beggars and early risers to find a hostel. Unfortunately, wherever there are cows, there are also cow pats, Chris being the first to fall victim to a messy flip flop, but he was easily cleaned up when we got to our room and then we had a few hours sleep before going out to explore the city in the daylight.

We couldn't have asked
Old town Varanasi
for a better introduction to India than arriving in Varanasi at festival season. With many Indians also on holiday the city was buzzing with activity with people going to temples, shopping, eating and taking trips on the Ganges. We spent many hours getting lost in the narrow lanes of the old part of the city and probably similar amounts of time trying the many new foods on offer. It seems that in India there's no better way to start the day than with a dosa pancake which come with a choice of various spicy or occasionally sweet fillings, all served with a soupy vegetable curry and curd. Lunch and dinner are selected from a range of amazing curries. If anyone was concerned that Emma, as a vegetarian, might be getting protein deficient, they can rest assured that she's eating huge amounts of paneer cheese with almost every meal. There's an abundance of street food which can mean a meal for both of us for under a pound or there are loads of cheap restaurants serving thalis, plates comprising a selection of curries, rice and breads, which are also pretty cheap. We thought that it would be wrong just to limit
Pilgrims gathering for Aarthi on the River Ganges
our culinary experience to the savoury and so have also tried a few sweetshops selling amazing Indian sweets made of coconut, syrup, curd, nuts and large amounts of sugar. At our current rate of consumption, it's possible we'll both be obese and have type two diabetes by the time we leave India, so we might have to moderate at some point, we'll see how it goes!

Varanasi is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, it's also considered a very holy place with many people believing that if you die in the city, you obtain instant Moksha (enlightenment). As a result of this, there's a disproportionate number of old people in the city who have essentially come here to die. As a holy river, the Ganges is a hub of activity, with pilgrims and locals coming here to bathe, drink and take bottles of the water, undeterred by the fact that they are sharing it with sewer and factory outlets, and cows that also get herded in for a dip. Leading down to the Ganges are a whole load of ghats (series of steps), some with special significance, but all of them quite ancient. These included
Aarthi, Varanasi
a couple of burning ghats, where funerals are held and bodies are openly cremated at the side of the Ganges. There are also many temples and religious ceremonies along the banks of the river with a main ritual (aarthi) every evening attended daily by up to 1000 people where holy men wave lit torches and insence, and ring bells, whilst people send marigolds and candles out into the Ganges to bring good karma and are blessed by Sandhus giving out tikas (the little spot you often see on people's foreheads that represents a third eye).

All of this would have been great on its own, but we were additionally lucky to arrive at the close of Durga Puja with a huge colourful festival which thousands attended. Scores of statues of the goddess Durga were paraded through the streets to the beat of drums and with men dancing behind them (doesn't seem to be the done thing for women to do). They were then loaded onto boats and taken out onto the Ganges before being tipped overboard whilst holy men from across the country gave speeches (in hindi) and chanted. It was a great evening and we felt quite privileged
More Aarthi
to be there amongst the many pilgrims and locals that had turned out as well to see the festivities.

With the celebrations behind us, we decided it was time to move on, and after a rather laborious process of filling in forms and being directed from one counter to another, we managed to book a train from Varanasi and travelled by overnight sleeper to Agra. The train itself wasn't too bad. Well it was dirty and rickety, the sleeper berths were hard, and there weren't any blankets; but you get what you pay for, and we'd paid a few pounds to travel several hundred kilometres. The only slightly awkward aspect was the method of rubbish disposal. Having finished our dinner and chai, all and sundry were instructing us to throw our foil packaging out the window of the train. It's just the done thing rather than letting rubbish clog up the train. There are no bins here - not on the street, public transport or indeed anywhere, except occasionally next to your toilet (best not look inside). Unfortunately peer pressure won through in the end, but we justified it that if we'd have kept our rubbish on the train,
Dawn boats
someone else would have chucked it through the window anyway and people were starting to get a bit annoyed at the smell of curry emanating from our corner. We're not sure that dumping rubbish here, there and everywhere is something we'll get used to, but if we do, please remind us that it's really not on, and direct us towards the nearest bin.

Having got to Agra early in the morning, we checked into a cheap room which had roof top views of the Taj Mahal, and having arrived on a day that the Taj was closed, we spent the rest of the day at the 16th Century Agra Fort. Accustomed to early mornings now, we got up at sunrise the next day to go and see the Taj Mahal and try to beat the crowds arriving on tours. As luck would have it, it was a muslim festival, and subsequent to this, there were 3 hours when it was free entry for foreigners to see the Taj Mahal. There was a slight kerfuffle at the male gate (men and women go in separately) when, on being frisked, Bob was discovered in Chris' pocket. Bob was somewhat upset to
Dawn on the Ganges
discover that neither sheep or toys are permitted into the Taj Mahal and that Chris would have to put him in a locker and then queue to get in again. He was further annoyed when he realised that security had actually referred to him as a 'toy', but fortunately he managed to contain his outrage and kept quiet whilst Chris, in his usual genial manner, managed to persuade security that we would keep Bob under control, not let him roam on the lawns and keep him out of sight in vicinity of the Taj Mahal. So in the end, they let him in, and fortunately for us, Bob behaved himself.

After the Taj Mahal, we headed off by tuk tuk and then by bus to the abandoned city of Fatehpur Sikri 40km away. The city was built in the 16th Century but abandoned soon after completion when the ruling emperors moved to Agra. They're not certain why it was abandoned, but many speculate that it was due to lack of water in the region, although we didn't find this a problem with people selling not just water, but soft drinks as well round every corner. After about an hour
Giving offerings for good karma
of trying to ditch the hoards of self-appointed guides, 10 rupee garnet necklace sellers and small children trying to get money from us whilst we looked around the 'free entry' parts of the complex including the mosque and a tomb of a Sufi Saint; we went into the ticketed area which was much quieter and more pleasant to walk around. It is amazing how old some of the buildings are in India, yet looking around, the structure, carvings and mosaics remain in such good shape, it's like they were built yesterday.

Although we've really enjoyed our time so far in India, it hasn't been without its hassle. Constituting only minor hassle are the large number of people begging and Sandhus asking for money to live on. It seems that the done thing is to hand out small change frequently, which we do, but not being able to give money to everyone, we invariably pass many by. Slightly more irkesome are the touts who try to get you into various shops where they will then get commission. The means by which they do this are usually to follow you and talk to you at length hoping that you'll give in
Our Boatman
in the end. Chris managed to pick up one particularly annoying individual on our last day in Varanasi who followed him just about everywhere trying to get commission each place he went, claiming that he'd taken him there. He even tried to get money out of the barber when Chris went for a shave! Fortunately store owners favoured Chris and his hanger-on got nothing, but not for want of trying. Not all touts are that annoying though, some actually seem genuinely quite friendly and chatty with only half-hearted attempts to sell us things or otherwise separate us from our money. It does seem to be only men that speak to us and most of these will only approach and talk to Chris when we are out together. This has advantages and disadvantages for Emma, who as an accompanying wife, often might as well be invisible, and can get ignored even when she's trying to join in conversations to have a response directed at Chris with a definitive 'Sir' at the end in case there was any doubt that Emma should not be trying to join in man's talk. This has caused some slight disgruntlement on occasion, but fortunately we're finding
Early morning activity on the ghats
new and creative ways of managing it and Emma has only lost her temper once or twice. Of those that aren't trying to sell us things, there are many men that will just stare wide-eyed, gawping, usually at Emma, but often at both of us, and occasionally at Bob (although less so, since it seems they're more used to sheep than white people). The more annoying people will also take photos (very occasionally people ask permission first) and we think that there are now more photos of Emma around on Indian mobile phones than we have for our entire trip so far. Emma has just started taking photos back of the staring culprits but it does get a bit tiring. That said, aside from the annoying people, we've also met quite a few lovely, non-staring people who've been nice to talk to. The difficulty is trying to identify the genuinely friendly, chatty people early on and differentiate them from those that are going to be trying to sell you something or ask for a donation in ten minutes time. Well, we've got two months to try and figure this one out, but for now, we've left Uttar Pradesh and got

Things we have learnt so far in India

Never ever drink water from the Ganges

Allow at least 4 hours to book a train ticket (time required to do a circuit of every desk in the station, fill in countless forms, provide copies of your passport and then end up back where you started)

Succeeding in booking a train, even if it's not the right one, is an achievement in itself.

Cows can eat just about anything - we've seen them feeding on curry, plastic bags, sewage, cardboard boxes and many other unidentifiably things besides (We haven't seen many eating grass though which appears to be in rather short supply in the cities).

We may not be able to sample every type of sweet available in India (but Emma's going to give it her best shot anyway)

Tallies

Altercations with grumpy bulls in narrow alleys - 2. Both with the same bull. An old hindu holy man who Emma had given some money to earlier came to our aid and beat the bovine with a stick. Now that's karma in action.
The Ganges at Varanasi


Different curries sampled - 46 (approx)

Durga statues now settled at the bottom of the Ganges - hundreds, possibly thousands

Traveller food 'rules' broken - 12 including drinking drinks with ice, eating various street foods, dairy products and salad. And then there was the ice cream. Yum.

Major stomach upsets - 0. Hurrah!

Buddha Shakyamuni
Beneath this statue at the Mulagandhakuti Vihara are some of the Buddha's relics.
On my second day in Bodhgaya, I received the news that, due to an emergency at his monastery in Nepal, Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche would be unable to lead the pilgrimage to the four holy Buddhist sites as planned. I had joined the group primarily for his presence, so I was disappointed to say the least. Then I saw the group I was going to be accompanying and, suddenly, I didn’t want to go anymore.

The group consisted of 30-odd Westerners of all ages, some there merely to experience something new and others on their umpteenth Buddhist pilgrimage. My discomfort had little to do with the individuals of the group, but rather more to do with the group as a whole. For the first time since I had signed up, I realized that I was about to be shuttled around on a big, air-conditioned bus with a flock of foreign tourists for a week. I’ve always likened such groups to cattle drives – and now I was going to be part of one. Why hadn’t I thought of that before?

For the following four days, I thought about it plenty. I came up with every possible excuse to justify my
Mulagandhakuti Vihara
dropping out: without Rinpoche it wasn’t worth it; it would be more beneficial to stay in Bodhgaya and do more prostrations; the timeframe was too short, and I could do a better job of it all on my own. It was that last excuse that kept coming up over and over again. I’ve always had problems being a team player, preferring to do things in my own way and on my own time. As I’ve gotten older, my mind has hardened around certain preconceived notions of what it means to be part of a group, especially when it comes to traveling. This case was no different. I didn’t want to be one of them.

It’s an uncomfortable truth that I’m not all too eager to admit, but hopefully through admission it can be overcome. The fact of the matter is that as part of a group of Westerners, I don’t stand out enough. Traveling mostly in countries where the locals look nothing like me, I’ve become accustomed to sticking out like a sore thumb. And, although I’ve never liked being singled out as an outsider, my ego unconsciously thrives on the attention. Even when I’m adopted into a group
Ashoka's Pillar, Sarnath
Among many of the places believed to be the site of the Buddha's first teaching.
of “others,” my status as a newcomer marks me as different enough that my ego is subtly fed. Put it in a group of Westerners who look and act just like me and the food source is disrupted. My ego gets hungry and agitated. If only to starve that ego, I had to carry on with the pilgrimage. After all, pilgrimages are all about purification.

It turns out that I’m not the only one who’d had misgivings about continuing on with the pilgrimage without Rinpoche. Half the group dropped out before we left, and a half of those remaining caught sick – including the bus. We’d hardly been on the road five minutes before it broke down. Even fixed, its horn cried out a lamentable and unceasing whee-o-whee-o-whee-o. Despite its complaints, we spent more time in the bus than anywhere else, traveling hundreds of kilometers between each site. Stopping to eat was an operation that we never managed to accomplish in less than an hour and a half. Finally at each destination, we’d shuffle off the bus, make a quick pass around the ruins, perform a sadhana (a combination of mantra and meditation), and then get back onto the
Damekh Stupa, Sarnath
bus to start the journey to the next site.

The experience wasn’t at all what I expected. But if I had a dollar for every time I’ve said that, I’d surely be a rich woman. And to say it was unexpected isn’t to say that I didn’t feel incredibly advantaged for the opportunity to be there – I most definitely did. All I want to say is that, while I would have liked for this to be a more informative piece of writing, full of insights and humorous anecdotes, I actually have very little to say. Hopefully, the time restrictions are understood and my dry reporting can be forgiven.

After Bodhgaya, the first stop of the pilgrimage was Sarnath, where the Buddha first taught the Dharma. Five weeks after his enlightenment, he traveled there in search of five of his former companions. Finding them in Deer Park, he instructed them on the Middle Way, the Eightfold Path and the Four Noble Truths. As a result of their understanding, they too became enlightened, and thus established the Sangha of noble disciples. After visiting the temple that houses some of the Buddha’s relics, we went into the nearby city of
Pilgrim Silhouette
Varanasi where we had planned a peaceful boat ride on the Ganges.

Trying to get to the ghat that led down to the river, however, we got caught in the middle of the Durga immersion ceremony. The last day of the Durga Puja, the effigies of the many-armed goddess are brought to the water’s edge and immersed in a symbolic act of the goddess’s return to her husband Shiva. The idols were transported through the streets in the beds of pick-ups, each carrying a set of speakers that thumped with the force of the bass. Hoards of drunken men followed behind, some menacingly brandishing sticks, others pointing one finger skyward in a movement reminiscent of the days of disco, as they violently thrust their hips in time with the beat.

For women to join in the festivities was out of the question. In a moment of disregard, my shoulders involuntarily started moving with the music. All around me, jaws dropped open and lust throbbed in the eyes above them. As the third pair of fingers closed tight around my right butt cheek, I lost my cool. For the first time in months, I reacted without any thought or
Immersion Ceremony
awareness of what I was doing. I spun on my heel and threw my hand up with the middle finger extended. Months of annoyance at dealing with India’s staring, groping men came out in one explosive, “F**K YOU!!!” The small, offending man cowered. I instantly felt terrible and forgave him his ignorance. Luckily, the party had almost passed and no one bothered me beyond that.

The last official stop of the pilgrimage was in Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini. But as it lies just on the other side of the India-Nepal border, I wasn’t able to join the group there – unless I wanted to spend another two months exiled from India. So, for me, the pilgrimage ended in Kushinagar. The place of Buddha’s death, the site was pervaded with a deep feeling of loss. With this reminder of the impermanent nature of all things, it was the perfect place to end the pilgrimage – and this stage of my life. Coming up is a phase of sedentarism in a city. It’s time to get a job.

But first, I took a good look in the mirror for the first time in over a month. The signs of impermanence were

present all over my body. I’ve always said that’s it’s my goal to become a wise old woman sitting in a rocker. And, although I can’t account for the wise part, it appears the old woman part is approaching faster than I could’ve reckoned. All the telltale signs are there: the bat wings, crow’s feet, and turkey waddle. What was once hard and firm has turned soft and squishy. What were faint traces of wrinkles have become deeply etched into the flesh of my forehead. My hair is thinning, and turning gray. With a great sense of urgency, as if I could reverse the effects of time with their removal, I started plucking out each white hair. But with a good laugh, I saw the futility of my efforts and embraced my impermanent nature.

Hey...

Sorry for the delay, but we had a long day in Delhi and I wasn't realy up to going back to the basement internet cafe near the hotel there, and didn't realize there was a free business center in the hotel in Varanasi....

I'm doing this from memory, so if it'll be an overview, and if I miss something, i'll come back to it when I can....

First thing in Delhi was a visit to Humayan's tomb. It was builtfor the 2nd Mughal emperor by his wife. it was originally intened to hold only him, but now holds 100 or so bodies. I walked around it, while Haviva walked up the stairs to the roof. After that we went to the Iqtub (okay, that's the wrong spelling) minaret which is really tall, and surrounded by neat ruins of a mosque that was built from demolished Hindu temples.

Okay, travelblog keeps freezing on me, so i have to go... More when I can.

Local Tip
Varanasi, was to be one of the highlights of the trip. It's home to the Ganges river and approximately 1.2 million people. It's a busy place, loads of horn blowing, a lot of motorbikes, cars, rickshaws and cows, many cows. We got there after a 12 hour overnight train, sleeping through 90% of the journey.

We had a walk down all of the ghats, starting at the first of 88. The ghats are a series of steps leading down to the Ganges, each one with a different name. Hundreds of people were jumping in, bathing and having a wash. It was quite an experience, one that none of us were willing to try. The water was too dirty, there were dead dogs, cows and people in there along with all the sewerage of Varanasi. We headed towards the las Ghat, named the Burning Ghat, which was where the deceased were brought to be burned in their own fires. It was seen as the most holy way and best way to leave the human world. You could see everything in the mist of the flames. We headed back towards the Assi ghat or the first ghat and boarded a long boat
Varanasi Harbour
Where we took the sunset and sunrise boat trips from
to cruise off into the Ganges for a candlelit procession. We lit over a hundred candles and let them drift away into the river, it looked quite special. They also hold a ceremony to bless the river, done on a daily basis, every day of the year and bringing in thousands of people.

So after a sunset boat ride we had a sunrise boat ride. The same sort of thing but without the ceremonies. We saw all the people at the end of their pilgrimage taking the dip in the Ganges for the first time. Further down was the main burning ghat, burning over 300 people a day with each taking 3 hours to burn. It is a very open service, no grieving and a real celebration of life until that point. We didn't feel out of place by being there one bit. We did find out about one kind of holy man, the Aghori, often with dreadlocks and orange clothing. The different thing about these guys was that they eat the ashes of the dead with the belief that it gave them supernatural powers.

Now in the the afternoon, Laura was about to become a cropper to
Laura's Rug
This is it! Laura contemplating pretty hard
the textile trade. We went to a silk and cotton outlet. It was all genuine products at a fraction of the price, a silk scarf for 20-30 pounds. But Laura saw a throw, with very fine hand woven patterns and ended up buying it and sending it home. It cost though as much as what we have spent in our time in India. You will see it when we get back, if it makes it! The wonder also gave us an I depth lesson on how to test for real silk and cashmere, after learning that the cashmere turban I bought was not cashmere but probably a polyester blend.

The old town where we were was a higgledey-piggledey sort of place, small nooks and crannies all over and dead bodies being carted down towards the ghats, I don't think you would find this anywhere else and we became accustomed to seeing the stretchers being carried around. We had seen most of the things that Varanasi had to offer, the only thing we missed which was the Well. So we occupied the rest of the day with the cinema and a film called Barfi. Good film, a must watch in
An Aghori
This is one o the infamous Aghori! 30 rupees for his photo
England! It'll be there soon. Guaranteed. And McDonald's too.

A day later and both Laura and I had come to the end of our Diarrhoea Dodging escapade. We had been struck down by it. Not in the worst way, but not the best either. The morning a relaxed one and the afternoon we went on the search for Aghori men, Kenny and Trine were trying to get a good portrait so we joined in. Ad we did get a few good ones too. People more often than not give the star of the photo some money. If it had been the same for us, getting paid every time people took a photo, we would have had a free trip! We had another overnight train back to Delhi to finish off the trip, a 13 hour one, but this time a much more uncomfortable ride than the last.

We had two days in Delhi to conclude the trip. The first with the group and the second without. In the end we spent both days pretty much on our own or at least independently of the group. We ventured off to the Lotus temple, one dedicated to no religion and

more about uniting them all. The building from the outside looked awesome, a big white lotus flower shaped building and the inside was one vast open space. No statues. No colour. Just a big open space. We went to the Lodi Gardens later, a big open space with trees and a lake and lacking the noise of the city and horns. It was so good to get away from the city even for a bit and relax. It was filled with chipmunks, red kites and parrots. This is the side of India that we haven't see a lot of, the upper class, more prosperous areas, completely different to the old towns. We also took the metro as a means of transport, similar to the tube in London and just as busy. This was the first time we had properly had to get around independently, and if we can get from a to b here, we can anywhere.

The evening we were all back together as a group, going out for our last meal in a place we had been to at the start of the trip. It was one of the best meals we had had, in terms of atmosphere and food. And then we all parted our ways and fingers crossed we will see quite a few on the way, we've planned to.

Saturday we moved out of the hotel and into the first of many hostels, out in the middle of nowhere costing 5 pounds for the two of us for one night. Bargain, and its closer to the station too! We had gotten the hang of the metro now, so getting our big bags on board was easy and we got there this time with no confusion. One thing the Indians aren't good at is queuing, as soon as the train doors open there is a herd of people going on met by a ton coming off! We went back to Lodi gardens for the rest if the day to write this and get ready for Vietnam! Next time I write a blog it will be in Vietnam! Bring it on!

October 18th 2012
Published: November 8th 2012


Old and New
The road leading to the ruins of Jetavana.
Sravasti.In Sanskrit, it means City of Glory. And in the time of the Buddha, Sravasti was indeed one of the country’s most glorious cities. Situated in the fertile Gangetic plain, it was the capital of the kingdom of Kosala and home to over 180 million people – amongst them a wealthy merchant named Sudatta. While visiting his brother in the capital of the neighboring kingdom, Sudatta met the Buddha shortly after he had attained Enlightenment. He was so moved by the Buddha’s words that he immediately invited him to spend the rainy season in Sravasti as his guest. The Buddha accepted.

Sudatta returned to Sravasti to prepare a dwelling for the Buddha. He had found the ideal location in a wooded park that belonged to Prince Jeta, but the prince refused his offers to buy the land. Sudatta implored. Seeing his persistence, the prince finally agreed to a price he thought no man could pay – he would sell Sudatta the park if he could cover every inch of it in gold coins. Overjoyed, Sudatta immediately agreed.

The next morning Sudatta carefully began laying out the gold, covering the ground piece by piece. By afternoon, three-quarters of the land

were sparkling under the reflection of 1.8 million golden coins. Prince Jeta was astounded by Sudatta’s devotion. He understood that the Buddha must truly be extraordinary to inspire such faithfulness and refused to allow Sudatta to lay a single golden coin more, gifting the rest of the land him. Sudatta renamed the park Jetavana in his honor and the monastery he built there was to become a place of great import for the growing community of Buddha’s monks. Before he passed away into parinirvana, the Buddha spent 25 years teaching the Dharma in the groves of Jetavana. Thus, Sravasti is the place where Buddha lived the longest amount of time, and it is the place where he gave the largest amount of discourses and instructions.

Looking at it today, you’d never know that people once gathered here from all over ancient India to listen to the Buddha speak. More monkeys visit the humble remnants of Jetavana’s temples, stupas and monasteries than people. Nothing else remains but a very, very small village. Even its name has disappeared from the map, having changed to Sahet Mahet. But this is how it goes. Things go on changing. Cities change into cemeteries; cemeteries
Monkeying Around
change into cities.



Arriving at the end of the monsoon season, I found Sravasti an impossibly green, incredibly peaceful paradise of rice paddies and lotus ponds. My plan for being there was to focus on my meditation practice before heading out on my pilgrimage. But plans seldom go as planned with me. Having no guesthouses, the only places to stay in Sravasti are the various temples established by foreign Buddhist countries – Myanmar, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, etc. I stayed at the Korean Temple along with a group of elderly Koreans. The fact that they spoke no English in no way dissuaded them from talking to me. One woman in particular would search me out, motion me to sit at her side and then chatter away for half-hour stretches, at the very least. I’d smile and nod and watch as the crows attacked the ears of the water buffalo (I never did figure out what they were after).

For being such a small village, I found hundreds of things to occupy my time – and it wasn’t only for entertaining Korean grandmothers that my plan to practice all day began to dwindle to 6,5,4,3 hours a

day. Following the sounds of a Tibetan puja one morning, I stumbled upon the neighboring Bhutanese monastery. Every morning after that, I’d go to teach English to the small group of adolescent monks studying there. Then I discovered the temple’s library. I’ve always had a weakness for libraries and their smell of old, thumbed pages. In the heat of the afternoons, I’d relax in a corner under a fan and devour various books on Buddhism. When it cooled off, I’d go back to the Bhutanese monastery to take their dogs for walks deep into the surrounding countryside. It was my first real encounter with rural India.

In the economic sense of the term, the villagers of Sravasti are poor. Lopsided huts of mud and straw huddle together in small settlements that house the members of an extended family. They have no electricity, no running water, no toilets. Baths are taken at a communal pump. The bather wraps a towel around his waist to provide a modicum of privacy and dumps buckets of water over his head. Twigs are used as toothbrushes. Feces lie everywhere – that which is produced by the buffaloes is flattened into cakes and dried to
Shy Children
be used as fuel, while the human variety is gobbled up by dogs or mashed into the road by the wheels of passing bicycles.

Toddlers wear faded, tattered shirts and no pants, their bums rashy and exposed to the elements, their eyes goopy and attracting flies. Adolescents cut grass with small, hand-held sickles, squatting on their haunches for endless hours under the hot sun. Old farmers plow the fields with a team of buffalo, riding on the back of a wooden plow as the falsetto voice of a woman singing in Hindi warbles through a transistor radio attached to its yoke. Young or old, male or female, no one is used to seeing outsiders. At best, they’re deeply shy, at worst, contemptuously distrustful.

One afternoon I went out for a bike ride. As usual, I had no particular destination and ended up losing myself in the pathways that run through the rice fields. At a pond, I stopped for a rest and a drink of water (from my bottle, not the brackish pond water). After a short time, an elderly gentleman approached me with a quick stride, hostile eyes, and a large stick. He’d wrapped a sweat-stained cloth
Village Woman
around his head, and buttoned an old button-down shirt only once at nipple-height. His shorts were so short that in another time and place, they would have gone by the name hot pants and been the utmost of fashion. He stopped directly in front of me and brought the stick down with force into the ground. WHACK! He glared, thumping his chest with his hand and pointing at the ground. The message was clear, “THIS IS MINE!”

Instead of fulfilling its intention of scaring me away, the charade made me smile. It made me think that if only the Buddha were here, he could teach this man the value of letting go of his attachments to possessions, of his attachment to anger. All I could do was smile and act out my own charade. Oh this is yours! Very good! Bahut sundar! I pointed to all around me and shrugged. He softened a little and directed the way out.

After two weeks, change inevitability occurred. The deep green of the rice paddies transformed into golden and reddish hues. The villagers got used to seeing me and even greeted me. Groups of children began following me on my walks

with the dogs; the most adventurous would approach, point at the beasts at my side, and proudly exclaim, “Dog!” As my departure date drew nearer, the thought of leaving saddened me. But this is how it goes. Nothing lasts forever.

Taj
Classic and original photo at the taj!?
Any city that we are to visit in the up and coming week is going to struggle to beat Pushkar. It was nice to get to a place that more mellow and chilled than the hustle and bustle in previous places. So we were off to Jaipur, aka the Pink City because all the buildings are pink of course!!! It took us a 4 hour private bus trip to get there, picking up a few locals on the way. The hotel, the Jaipur Inn, had a table tennis set up so if worst came to worst there was entertainment there, if nothing else.



After our orientation walk it was clear to see that Jaipur is a crazy place, filled with people and the infamous Indian salesmen, stopping at nothing to get a sale and frequently following you a hundred meters or more with the price getting lower and lower the further you got. Safe to say that this wasn't our favourite place. Both Laura and I were not big fans. However the evening was going to be a good one, clubbing, Indian style. The club was in the bottom of a dead hotel and we weren't expecting much.
Elephants at the Amber Fort, Jaipur
But as we got in there, there was a dance floor, lasers, bouncers and drinks priced similarly to home (good job it was buy one get one free). After a few hours there we had had enough, too much Pitbull and Sean Paul and we had an early start.



Saturday morning and we were up and off by 7am, heading to the City of Amber just outside Jaipur. An ancient city with one huge fort at it's heart plus a load of ELEPHANTS! There must have been 50 or so of these massive Indian elephants taking people into the fort grounds, although I thought they looked healthy and happy others weren't so sure. The fort itself was pretty impressive and a good 6 of us had a tour around it with a local guide. When I say a tour it was more of a 'lets go sit on the steps and listen to a guy talk about history' for 20minutes tour, probably meaning we only saw half the fort. Still it was a cleverly built place with air conditioning and a 400 year old Jacuzzi. As for the rest of the afternoon we just moseyed around, doing
FaceTime
What happens when a group of westerners get wifi in a cafe.......for free
very mundane tasks like washing our clothes and writing blogs/dairies.



It was the evenings in Jaipur that were the best, first a club and then a Bollywood film at the Raj Mandir, a huge cinema with only one screen and a whole load of people. Cinema in India is not like at home. For one, everyone cheers as the curtains go up along with the rest of their family. Two, at very random points, or at least we thought it was random as we don't understand Hindi, the crowd would erupt into a mixture of applause and whooping. The film, English Vinglish, was a hit with us all and we made sense of it in our own little way.



Now as we were going home, we saw a weird looking man riding a motor bike, pretty expressionless in the face. I wouldn't normally write in things like this but it's more for my memory than anyone else's. Back to the point, the man was riding behind us for a long time, for at least 15 minutes with his old man out and from what we saw he was frantically 'scratching' it, I don't think it would hold up in court that way though and that wouldn't be the best combination of words to describe it either. Bit of an odd man I think. But that was Jaipur, a place none of us would go back to, unless you want to see a Bollywood film in an excitable crowd. The next stop however will be one of the highlights of the trip, Agra and the Taj Mahal.



Another early morning start from Jaipur, it was a 4 30 wake up call for our 5 40 train. Laura and I were bunked in with 4 Indian men, so the ride wasn't comfortable and I was sleeping with one eye open, looking out for the stray hand in our bags. The ride was good and into Agra much earlier than expected. The hotel was in the best spot possible, slap bang in the middle of a Costa and a PizzaHut, the western cravings now at an all time high. PizzaHut and Coffee down! In Agra there isn't too much to do other than see the Taj, and that was tomorrow's plan, so we went to a mall..... about 7 shops inside it with limited stock. McDonalds on the way home and that was the afternoon done! Not an exciting one. A few of us went to a Sound and Light show at the Agra Fort, consisting of a man talking alongside lots of lights inside a massive fort. The lights were good, sound great, mans voice very soothing = James asleep. Bed time as tomorrow morning we Taj it up!



The day of the Taj Mahal! 5am start and a very long day ahead of us. We were going to experience the Taj at both sunrise and sunset to see its beauty from both angles. We were at the Taj by 6am and the lines were massive, security went through all your personal belongings to make sure you had nothing that could deface it. You go in and you are hit by this postcard perfect building and backdrop, it doesn't look real. After loads of the cliche photos we had a look around. Not only the Taj but the surrounding grounds are perfectly symmetrical, right down to the finest detail. It was built for the kings wife when she died, its one amazing tomb, nothing other than that! There is one part though, that is not symmetrical, the kings coffin that was placed besides the queen when he died. It was an awesome place, easy to see why it is one of the 7 wonders of the world and so it should be if it took 22 years to build!



Away from the Taj, Agra doesn't have much, so we went back in the evening and saw it from the other side of the river at sunset. Equally as brilliant. I managed to get a photo of both the sun and Taj in the same shot after running down the river bed a few hundred meters, but you weren't 'allowed' to do that, still got the photo. That was it, another PizzaHut and another overnight train at 11 30.

Asia » India » Uttar Pradesh » Lucknow
October 3rd 2012
Published: October 3rd 2012


The night was short and I left Ayodhya on a tempo with a bunch of school girls destination Faizabad to take a bus to Lucknow. The bus itself was a dirty piece of rusty metal. People would wipe the seats with newspapers before sitting down. The ride was shorter than I had anticipated: two and a half hours. It was semi-comfortable as I had to keep my big bag on my lap and there was little legroom. I sat next to an engineering student (everybody I meet seems to be one!) checking his notes on the Leibniz theorem. Another guy tried talking to me but the pan he was chewing and the broken English didn’t make for a very productive conversation.

Once in Lucknow I get robbed 50 rupees by a rickshaw to the train station to leave my bag for the day. The train station looks nice with its pastel red towers. The clerk at the cloak room didn’t seem excited by his job but he gave me a little piece of paper I’d better not lose. I sat at the station restaurant to cool off, waiting for lunch time.

For lunch, I went to Tunday Kababi. Apparently, it’s a century old institution making the best Lucknow-style kababs in the world. It’s located in a half-broken street in the old market area of Aminabad. Outside the restaurant, I could see the cooks preparing the food. They would throw small patches of spiced mutton meat inside a giant oily skillet and they would come out as crunchy yet creamy pucks of flavored mutton. Mmmmm… Next to that there was a chicken barbecue station and a bread-making area. It all looked very appetizing… I stepped inside the basement restaurant (hey there’s a picture of the owner with Sharukh Khan!) and took a seat next to the fish tank. There were big multicolored fish including one of those albino-ish eel-types, and a small turtle. There was a doll pretending to be eaten by a giant plastic spider under water. The fish kept trying to mess with the doll’s hair. An old Muslim reached over my table to film the tank with his low-def phone. It was a bit obtrusive. He also snapped pictures of me eating and looking at the fish (Huge “click” sounds).

I ordered mutton kabab with a saffron paratha and a pepsi. Man, was it good! I had the texture of peanut butter and the spices were off the hook! I then ordered beef kabab with those roti that look like handkerchiefs and a pepsi again. Double whammy! I strongly recommend this address. In fact, I strongly recommend Lucknow itself.

The Bara Imambara is unimaginably beautiful. It’s a palace complex built by the Nawabs from the late 18th century onwards. The first gate lead me to a very lovely garden surrounded by finely-carved walls covered with stone Hershey’s Kisses and little towers. The second gate opened the door to another dimension: A domed, sculpted and twisted mosque on the right, the edges of which seemed to be made out of intricate brown lace. On the left, a three-storey (or was it four?) step-well that would have been magnificent if the water was clean. Right in front of me: a giant palace with a succession of windows and openings over what seemed to be a giant hall. Again, the Hershey’s Kisses on top.

I got inside the palace in what is known as the Bhool Bhulayia (aka. the labyrinth). I needed to take off my shoes and take out my pocket lamp because the hidden stairs and never-ending hallways could have been treacherous. I navigated around the building and ended up on the roof where the view was magical. Back down, I had a well-deserved ice cold soda, checked out the palace interior (there was a large hall after all) and saw the step-well.

A short walk form the Bara Imambara, there is the Chota Imambara, another palace, a bit more modest but a very lovely area to spend a quiet hour or so. There is a palace of course, topped by a golden dome. Inside, there was the silver throne of one of the nawabs and portable tomb replicas that were used for processions. A lot of colored chandeliers, too. The garden is very peaceful with a large water basin in the middle. I saw a kingfisher dive for food in there. There were palm trees and flowers and lots of naked flower pots. From time to time, I would spot a mongoose working its way through the bushes and between the pots. In fact, I saw plenty of them. One almost got through the palace entrance! There’s also a small former hammam and tombs that are dodgy replicas of the Taj Mahal. By now, I’ve probably brushed aside about 5 wannabe guides who tried to sneak up on me: they pretended to be security; they made small comments as if they were also visitors, etc. I’m starting to know how they work…

Across the street, in a large red stone former palace (another one!), there’s the “picture gallery” with life-size paintings of the nawabs including one who purposefully has a wardrobe malfunction and exposes his left nipple. Weird. There’s a tall clock tower in a desolate park, left behind by the Brits who had made Lucknow one of their local strongholds.

I then got into a scuffle with a cycle-rickshaw. We had agreed that he would take me to the Residency for ten rupees (I admit, it was low, but I was going to give him more at the end). We left the clock tower and he started wandering around asking me if he needed to go straight ahead or turn. Dude, you’re the driver! In the end, he had agreed on the ride without understanding a thing I said. It’s happened quite often but usually I realized it earlier. Anyways, we got into a big argument at an intersection because he now wanted WAY more (a policeman served as interpreter). I ended up giving just 5 rupees and left on foot angry. All the other rickshaws, trying to get me, got the “No” equivalent of a middle finger. I was really pissed.

Fortunately, I walked into a park that had rusty and screeching rides like a pirate ship and a tilt-a-whirl. The paddleboats looked like they were sinking and the giant slide was overgrown with weeds.

I managed to get to the Residency before 5PM. This is where the Brits held tight during the 1857 revolt. It used to be the HQ of the local governor with all his entourage and the administrations and churches that go with it. The siege of Lucknow must have been terrifying. For months, bombs and bullets would riddle the buildings from outside the fortified compound and people from both sides died in the thousands. The area has been left as it was at the end of the siege: in ruins. Red-brick bullet-holed weedy ruins. The park itself is very peaceful, ironically. This is where local couples come to hide, flirt and smooch. There was lots of wildlife too: tweet-tweeting birds, click-clicking squirrels and yap-yapping puppies (I helped one out of a big stone gutter). Walking through the overgrown cemetery was very eerie as tombs would appear behind bushes and tall grass: the perfect setting for a ghost story.

After walking around the park until sunset, I rode a cycle-rickshaw down main road in what was surprisingly a very modern downtown. Shops were still open and people of all ages were window-shopping on the sidewalks (real sidewalks!), looking into brightly-lit clothing stores (Benetton! Reebok! Tommy Hilfiger!), walking past luxury hotels and neon cinemas (Heroine, now playing) and hanging out outside restaurants or against food carts. I’m planning on staying in the area before I go to the train station. There are supposed to be some nice restaurants and a good sports bar. Enough to keep me entertained before my night train back to Delhi!

Daily nugget: A sign at the Bara Imambara said that “To spread filth is the nature of the animal, we are human”. In fact, the palace was pretty clean so being all philosophical just might work.
