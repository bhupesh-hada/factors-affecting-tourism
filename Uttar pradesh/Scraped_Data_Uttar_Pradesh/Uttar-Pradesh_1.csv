I arrived in Ayodhya at night. It was 9:30PM and I needed to find a hotel. Street lights are few and far between in Ayodhya and the blind walk through the city felt a bit dangerous. I was hoping to just find a hotel after a while and get a roon there. It was a bad plan. The first hotel didn’t accept foreigners, the second one was full. My chances started to look pretty grim. Then Anmul showed up. He parked his Hero Honda next to me and told me to jump onto it. He couldn’t speak English but understood “hotel”. The ride on the back of his motorcycle was pretty fun and very smooth. He took some nice turns and was good at passing cows and slow pedestrians. He kept asking me all these questions even though I kept saying “no Hindi”. It got a bit confusing when I had to explain to him that one hotel he brought me to was already full (It was the second one I tried earlier). The first hotel was full, the second accepted only pilgrims but the third one had a room. Anmul left me at the reception and disappeared on his metal steed. Cool guy.

The Ram Hotel is big: large hallways, people everywhere, high ceilings. It’s moderately clean but the openings in the wall for the fan and under the door have allowed a few critters to get in. At one point a cockroach jumped onto the leg of the clerk who took me to the room and he just brushed it off. Gulp! Thankfully, nothing apart from the occasional mosquitoes (Splat!) and a curious gecko have been spotted in the room since then.

A woke up late this morning after a good night’s sleep. I headed out onto the streets of Ayodhya at abouth 10AM. Ayodhya is famous as the birthplace of Rama and is therefore a holy city for Hindus. It’s a major pilgrimage destination but isn’t very touristy. Again, I had a little map I printed beforehand. Some guy in a blue shirt was intent on showing me around, speaking only Hindi. He was a pain to get rid of but “no guide” was enough. First I went to the imposing Hanuman Temple, which sticks out of the city underneath it with fortress-like walls and a tall dungeon-like vihara. The entrance to the temple can only be reached through a set of 40-odd steps one needs to climb barefoot. I wasn’t looking forward to it… People were buying sweets from the vendors spread around the entrance area: they all had brown balls of pure sugar tacked in pyramids behind glass counters. The sweets were offerings for the gods. The boxes ended up in the hands of beggars who used them as rupee collectors. There were beggars on each step, on both sides. Some were old, some were blind, some were handicapped, and some were all at once. I packed my shoes in my backpack and climbed.

The top of the temple is brightly-painted with gods, animals, flowers and various messages in Hindi. The sanctuary itself is only for Hindus but I could see the police making sure people didn’t take too long to give their sweets to the attendants and move on. It was a big crowd after all. There was a large and packed prayer hall. A bell would ring from time to time and people chanted altogether. The floor was sticky from water, sweets and flower petals.

On my way down, I wiped my feet while some guy kept staring at me from outside the shop I was sitting in. I was facing me, striking different poses but I didn’t give him the satisfaction of a conversation. I already had 3 dull conversations in the temple itself. I bought a VCD with songs about Hanuman (should be entertaining!) to justify my staying in the shop and left.

There are lots of crap vendors everywhere: bracelets, toys, CDs and posters of hologram babies. I got to see a few nice bhavans or palaces/houses in the area before it got too hot. I was getting hungry too so I headed back to the hotel.

I had a chola bathura, two sodas and a nice nap before I decided to hit the streets again. At that moment, a truck load of soldiers walked into the hotel for some reason, climbing into the first floor. I don’t know what that was all about…

I headed for the Rama temple, the place where Rama himself was supposedly born. About 20 years ago, there used to be quite a lovely 16th century mosque at that spot, built by the Mughal Emperor Babur. It was torn down by thousands of Hindu extremists who wanted the place to be rededicated as a temple to Rama. Some excavations “justified” their actions as idols were allegedly found under the mosque. Very sensitive material. As a result, Ayodhya is a city of cows, monkeys and policemen. They are everywhere, hanging out, looking authoritative. Visitng the temple for a foreigner is a bit of a hassle. Here’s how it went. First I checked in all my belongings except my passport and my wallet (there were lockers fortunately), then I got frisked a first time. A few meters after that, old wise men wrote all my passport details in a small notebook. I then got frisked a second time. I was escorted by a random dude who took me through a metal fenced walk way to the next security check where I was frisked again. Once more, the dude, the fence and the security check: frisked for the 4th time. I was then taken to see the idol, which was standing under a tarp on top of a small hill, illuminated by neon and watched over by soldiers on all sides. That was it.

Walking up the main road, I ended up in a park with benches in the shade. Most importantly, there were monkeys. Lots of them. I sat down and filmed them as they were playing/fighting/eating. At one point, a man accompanied by one of those transvestites that bring good luck to a wedding came to talk to me. It was in Hindglish and the conversation didn’t get very far. The purple sari wearing transvestite said something to the guy in a deep voice and they left. There was an argument between a sadhu and the guy in charge of keeping the monkeys away (he was doing a bad job by the way).Once the argument was over, the guy kept throwing stones at the monkeys who inexorably came back…

Further up the road, there are the Ayodhya ghats. A small branch of the river comes into the city and ghats have been built around it to encourage people to do their bathing rituals. It was the dirtiest water I dhad ever seen. Garbage and feces was floating in the stagnant water and algae the kind that grows from trash and chemicals was growing all over. A small rowboat was navigating for some reason. They waved at me. There were more cows than people, which meant that the ground was covered in patches of semi-dry dung. The repugnant smell alone was enough to keep me away from exploring further. The visit was short. I walked back to the hotel and waited for the internet café to open.

I’m planning on watching the India cricket game in the lobby of the hotel tonight (there is no TV in my room unfortunately).

Daily nugget: I’ve been writing this update through three power cuts. The guy kept playing with the switches and I think a generator is involved. Thankfully, I had saved everything on Word

October 1st 2012

I skipped the early morning rituals and slept till 9AM. A nice shower and a paratha-with-curd breakfast gave me the strengths to hang out in my room to pack my bags for the next leg of my journey. I was going to watch a bit of TV under the fan until the right time but the Alka Hotel staff knew my weakness: they unplugged the satellite TV. I had to leave the room for the cleaners. Nicely played.

It was hot, there were people everywhere and I needed a rickshaw to go to the station. I was not in a good mood. I marched my way through the Old Town Varanasi streets, and ended up on the congested main road. I found a rickshaw driver who was willing to drive me to the station for 70 rupees. Good deal, I thought. He said however that he wanted one more passenger because that’s a cheap price for the ride. I said OK but little did I know that he was planning to rip me off in epic proportions. He ended up taking 5 other passengers in the cramped rickshaw, who paid only 10 rupees for the ride. I had all my bags and was too weak to get into a big fight. I am still fantasizing about the smack down I should have initiated. He got the idea when I threw the money on the back seat. He also understood the word “rip-off”.

Varanasi Junction is the large intestine of train stations. The piles of human, bovine and canine excrement on the tracks offered little to no breathable air to the platform 5 area. Every few minutes, people threw plastic bags, empty cups of tea and banana peels on the tracks that the wandering cows or monkeys just proceeded to rip apart. There was a constant flow of black, nearly radioactive water flowing near the tracks. I could see frogs in that water. I wonder if that’s how Godzilla was born. And I saw my first rats since I’m here! 4 large black disease-carriers squeezing their way through pipes and trash. I was glad to board the train. I sat near a blind lady and her grandson who told her when and where she could lie down. We reached Jaunpur City station in about an hour.

I stepped out of the station expecting to be assaulted by drivers. No such thing. People were casually staring at me while idle rickshaws were waiting by the side of the road. Jaunpur is not in my guidebook. In fact, I don’t believe it’s in any guidebook. I just read that there was a nice Mughal bridge, a fort and an unusual mosque. I had a little map I had printed at home in my pocket and I planned on trusting my gut feelings for this city. A climbed in a tempo to take me to the other train station where I would leave my bag for the day. The ride was nice, but cramped (it’s a tempo after all). At the station however, there was no cloakroom. I needed to carry my bag across the city. Bad start.

I hailed a cycle rickshaw to take me to Shahi Bridge, built by the Mughals. I got a few stares as I paraded high upon the rickshaw seat along the main street. The city itself is very colorful with old buildings reborn through pastel paint and bright advertisements. The street crossing the bridge is peppered with jewelry stores which gave me the impression that Jaunpur is a rather rich city. There weren’t many beggars either. At the bridge, I walk down to river level to take a nice picture of the bridge’s architecture, with its little towers on each side. I was getting a lot of attention at that riverside temple with my big bags and my camera.

Then I walked toward the fort, waving hello to curious onlookers and dodging the recurrent “Hello, man!”, “What country?” and “What’s your name?” I got tired of answering every request for attention… I was able to leave my bag at the entrance of the fort (Thank God!) and walked in. I got lucky when bird feces landed on my hand as I approached the gate. Could have been worse.

The walls of the fort are well-preserved and there is an old mosque and a ghostly hammam inside. The rest of it is just grass, trees and great views on the city and the river. Some guy with a big stick, probably in charge of chasing away monkeys, was following me and I had the bad feeling that he was trying to be my guide. I tried losing him more than once but his round face kept appearing over my shoulder. Eventually he let me go and I sat on a bench under a tree to read my notes on the fort (printed, also).

A kid with a “Ruff Jeans” t-shirt and an older teenager came to sit with me. Oh, no. Not again. But it turned out to be the best thing to happen to me in Jaunpur. Little Maz knew everything about Jaunpur and the fort. We ended up talking for about an hour. He told me about the history of India, religious equality and basic pop culture. He liked the Terminator, I Robot and Twilight. He’s a big Edward fan and hates Jacob. He thinks he’s ugly and stupid. His big brother couldn’t speak English but he was looking proudly at him as the little guy was having a full-blown conversation with the man from the other side of the world.

Later on, he offered to take me to Atala Masjid, the unusual mosque inspired by both Islamic and Hindu architecture. I followed him down the road and into the mosque. Proud Muslims were looking at me suspiciously and I kept asking Maz if everything was alright. Prayer calls resonated through the streets and it didn’t seem to be the best time to bother all of them. I filmed a bit and headed out. I bought myself some could drinks and offered Maz something but he wouldn’t take anything. He left with a “I want to go home, now. Good bye”. Such a genuinely nice kid.

Back at the station, I waited for my train with a book. People were sitting in groups with big bundles of whatever. Geckos came out of hiding when the sun went down and dogs were chasing each other across the tracks. A woman was washing her baby at the pump on the platform. It all seemed normal until Dr. Something came to talk to me. The train was running late (surprise!) and I was getting impatient. Dr. Something asked all the usual questions and told me about his family. He had a constant smile on his face that made him look dumb. So much so that even the other people who naturally orbited me were looking at him with a bit of embarrassment. He crossed the bridge with me when the train was announced to arrive on the next platform and stayed close. Eventually he told me that there was a party at the hospital he works at and he was a little drunk. That explained the smile. When the train puffed in, I ran to Sleeper car S5 and left him, finally.

People must have been carrying bundles of wood or grass on the seat I had reserved. There were bugs everywhere: tiny beetles, fleas, flies, small moths and even a big grasshopper that was struggling to fly near the ceiling fans. I kept checking my legs as I grew paranoid that something somewhere was crawling over me. At one point, I found a beetle inside my shirt. It didn’t seem to bother the Sikh man sitting in front of me that much as he just casually brushed aside a moth on his arm. I was the one to get rid of the grasshopper. It had landed on the Sikh guy’s bag on the seat in front of me and with a quick brush he was out the window. Nicely done.

Daily nugget: Maz knew about Berlin being the capital of Germany (thanks in part to Don 2 with Sharukh Khan) and I ended up recording a message from him for all Germany to be my friend. I’m a “great man”. That was nice…

Asia » India » Uttar Pradesh » Varanasi
September 30th 2012
Published: September 30th 2012


The familiar tune of my alarm clock rang at 5:15 this morning, just like most of the tourists in Varanasi. The day starts early here, especially if you want to watch the sunrise from a boat on the Ganges. So a bunch of us gathered at the hotel reception to board a boat that would leave at 6:00AM: there were two girls from Utah and a family visiting from Delhi. We boarded at the ghat beneath our hotel walking past people doing their morning bathing rituals. A tourist also wanted to try it: she treaded carefully into the water, probably sinking her feet into inches of goo and mud and when she built enough strength, dunked her head into the holy water. She raced out and back into the hotel, followed by curious onlookers admiring both her courage and her wet-shirt.

The motorboat went all the way to the southernmost ghat of Old Town Varanasi, Assi Ghat. On the way, we witnessed the morning rituals of thousands of Varanasians (?). There was the traditional bath that included lots of prayers to the Ganges and the rising sun. Some were just washing themselves vigorously with soap and using the Ganges as their personal outdoor bathtub. Others were washing their metal dishes… There was lots of hanging out: locals looking at the boats passing by, tourists on rooftops trying to snap that perfect picture, sadhus meditating/sleeping. Stray dogs would join in and wrestle through the mud to find some crunchy breakfast. The colors of the buildings on the riverbank would sparkle in the sunrise: red, blue, yellow, pink. It was all very picturesque and photogenic. The sun itself shined like a fireball and seemed to spring out of the horizon quite suddenly as it took us all by surprise. We were focused on watching the ghat side not the other…

Once we reached Assi Ghat, the driver turned the motor off and let us drift downstream back in the direction of the hotel. The ride back was more pleasant as we didn’t have that constant humming sound from the vintage motor. There were some quirky sights on the way back like a casual game of badminton doubles. The driver made sure we noticed the burning ghats. There were no cremations going on but you could see the leftovers of past ceremonies. There were sparkling threads of green, red and yellow fabric piled up near the riverbank, ashes from the corpses and the firewood were mixed together in dusty piles to be thrown into the river, and attendants were keeping the fire running 24/7 until the next scheduled cremation. No photography allowed. For once, that rule was well-respected.

Back at the hotel, I took a nap and had breakfast. Eggless pancake with banana and honey. It sounds better than it actually was. There’s a reason why the original pancake recipe requires eggs…

I had spent the night in a clean room, but it had a shared bathroom. The manager promised to give me a better room with a private bathroom for my second night. Originally, it should have been available at 11:00 AM. When the staff came into my room to get me (I was reading under the ceiling fan), I thought it was time to move to the next room and I could move on with my day. No. I was in hotel limbo. They needed to clean my first one and prepare the second one. The schedule was hazy at best. “In 15 minutes”, “At 12 noon”, “in 30 minutes”… I was left wandering around the hotel courtyard, looking at the river, sipping on soda. Screw this, I’ll take a walk. I strolled through the alleys of the Old Town, determined on finding postcards and actually be productive. I ended up negotiating a price for 10 postcards and little Ganesh stickers at a small shop. But during the whole postcard browsing, I felt a presence. “Hello, Sir”. A woman and a baby were behind me just waiting for a few seconds of my attention. This was a hard one. I hadn’t been in a very good mood because of the room situation and I needed some good karma so I caved. Also, she didn’t ask for money, but for milk for the baby. We went together to the stall and I bought some milk (first she tried to make me buy the premium kind, and the vendor was in cahoots, but my generosity has its limits). This might have been a trick all along. It might not have been her baby, she might resell the milk, and the vendor might be her accomplice, but what the heck. It’s just 50 rupees.

I still had time to write my postcards and talk to a guy checking into the hotel (“How is it like here?”. “It’s very slow”) before I got the room. Private bathroom and TV. Nice and clean, good. I proceeded with my plan of doing some laundry during the hottest hours of the day. My laundry water looked a lot like the Ganges itself after a few washing and rinsing. The volume of invisible dust my clothes had been gathering was incredible! In the background, I let the TV on and listened to a poor guy get rejected from India’s Got Talent. As a true backpacker, I let my clothes dry on the railing in front of my room, for all to see…

In the afternoon, I headed to Sarnath, where Buddha gave his first sermon to his disciples. It’s one of the 4 most holy places in Buddhism and a must-see for every visitor in Varanasi. I bargained with a rickshaw driver to take me there, wait for me, and bring me back. A small crowd gathered around me for the negotiations. We agreed on a fare that a bystander greeted with a “Very good bargaining!”. The ride from Varanasi to Sarnath was very entertaining. We had quite a few near-misses (or shouldn’t it be “near-hits”?) with motorcycles and incoming rickshaws and the cows here are real daredevils. Gradually though, the traffic disappeared and the final kilometers took us through tree-lined avenues that were both calmer and cleaner.

Once at the gate of the park, my rickshaw driver picked a spot and told me to come back when I’m ready. He asked that I remember his license plate number so I could find him more easily. Or just ask for “Super Monkey”. That’s his nickname apparently.

Now I know why there are so many Chinese tourists in Varanasi. There were busloads of them at Sarnath. I guess it’s a major pilgrimage site for Buddhists. There is a small 20th-century temple that was worth a short visit but the main attraction is the Damekh Stupa. This structure is a circular brick tower that sticks out of the ground like a giant nipple. It’s situated inside a large archeological area with the ruins of the ancient temple complex that was torn down by Muslim invaders. There were small prayer groups gathering around the stupa or in the ruins of the most important temples. Small candles burning, prayers tied to the wire-fence. Because Buddha was said to have preached in a deer park, there are enclosures around the area with actual deer. Kids would pop their heads through the fences and manipulate the barbwire to have a better look.

There was a Museum across the street that had all the statues and sculptures taken from the archeological site, including the capital of the local Ashokan pillar (I finally got to see one!), a giant stone umbrella and a finely carved Buddha. The air conditioning in the Museum was so strong I’m afraid I might have gotten a cold… After a bit of exploring, I discovered a newly-built Buddha statue in a park nearby, that had fountains with croaking frogs. Some guy was unashamedly in my face filming with his mobile phone. I let it side.

Super Monkey then brought me back to the ghats. On the way, we went by the fish market which is nothing else than a line of vendors on the sidewalk, swatting flies away from the glistening fish they had laid out on tarps in front of them.

For dinner, I went premium. I chose to go to the roof top of the best hotel on the ghats and had some chick pea balls in a curry and coriander sauce. I was wondering where all the Eastern European tourists were. I had seen Germans, Brits, Spaniards, Americans, people from France, China and Japan but none from Eastern Europe. Well, they were all at the Dolphin rooftop restaurant. A whole group of them, listening to their fast-talking and loud leader. They weren’t speaking Russian as I would have recognized it, but it was definitely Slavonic. The view from the top was great as sunset was approaching and boats were gathering to the Dasashwamedh Ghat for the Ganga Aarti (been there, done that). There were illuminated offerings floating on the river down below, shining in the full moon. Just as the final sunbeams evaporated, I could see dozens of kids on rooftops across the city flying square kites.

I ended the day in front of some cricket (again) sipping on orange soda after a nice shower. India beat Pakistan.

Daily nugget: As I walked back to the hotel a kid walked with me asking if I wanted to see the burning ghats. No. Then: “Do you want to get high?”. “What? How old are you?” “I’m sixteen.” He looked twelve. I told him, and then we started negotiating on his age. We settled on thirteen years old.

September 29th 2012

Waking up this morning in the comfy bed of the Valentines Hotel in Allahabad, I didn’t want to leave. I had slept like a baby after power cuts had threatened my cricket and room service evening. The idea of taking a sleeper class train did not appeal to me. At all.

The Bundelkhand Express was late, as usual. I managed to find my seat and put myself in a cozy position with my feet dangling over the other passengers’ heads as they walked by. I twisted and turned for 4 hours before we reached Varanasi. I had booked a driver to come and get me at the station and lead me to the hotel. I didn’t want to face the famously sinuous streets of Old Town Varanasi without knowing where exactly I was going. It was a good idea. You do not want to get lost in the labyrinthine back alleys of the Old Town. The floor was a soil formed from layers of trash, cow dung and spit and the occasional urine flowed across the paths through blackish yellow valleys. It was a succession of silk shops, food stalls, junk vendors, temples and restaurants until we had the hotel in sight. But our progress was jeopardized by a herd of cows slowing down traffic. A persistent sadhu kept banging on the cows’ butts to make them move but they were determined to take their time.

At the hotel: bad surprise. My room wasn’t ready. In fact, it will never be ready. The Ganges’ level has risen with the rains and the room was flooded. I was assigned a cheaper room with a shared bathroom, the only one available left. The get to the bathroom, I need to walk through the courtyard that has the restaurant and is the de facto hang out area of the hotel. Not exactly premium privacy. I’m not looking forward to my shower later.

My first glance at the Ganges was peaceful. From the hotel, you can see it gently strolling down, a few boats in the distance fighting the current the best they can. I was expecting to see some dead bodies in the water but I was surprised to see some life. In the distance, I saw a fish of some sort jumping above the surface, maybe it was one of those endangered Ganges dolphins, but that’s probably wishful thinking… The Ganges itslef is probably the dirtiest-looking water you'll ever see in your life, it actually caught fire at one point from a candle on a paper boat. The water can literally burn here. I wouldn't light a match in some of these smelly alleys either...

I snacked on some vegetarian pakoras with Limca, a local soda, and decided to leave my bags in my room and just explore a bit around the hotel. Since the ghats are covered with the overflowing Ganges, I need to go through the alleys to go from one ghat to the next. Thankfully I brought my compass to make sure of where I am (the Ganges is always to the East…).

I was expecting a lot of touts but it’s pretty reasonable. But here the services advertised are different:
- You want boat? No
- You want rickshaw? No
- You want hashish? No
Little girls are used to sell postcards through some kind of “Aww” factor and sadhus know who to target to put powder on the forehead. Varanasi is predictably a very touristy place and my hotel is 90% full of foreigners (lots of Chinese people). In the courtyard, I got to realize that I can take any smell that comes to my nostrils but cigarette smoke is definitely the worst.

I looked for the Brown Bread Bakery for some solace as it was supposed to be a very clean and welcoming place for tourists away from the hustle and bustle of the streets. Once inside, I was transported into a hippie El Dorado. Cushions on the floor, sitar and drums from the stereo, brightly colored tapestries on the wall and dim lighting for extra coziness. One French guy to my left was the clichéd hippie: barefoot ,touring the country for months, talking to strangers about Nepal, “What I love about this place is the people”. He also proceeded to roll a joint with “good stuff” on the table of some girls from England, who seemed more uncomfortable than interested by his adventures. One woman in a corner seemed to be meditating. I ordered some apple strudel with vanilla ice cream (it was a German bakery) and a lukewarm banana lassi. I headed back to the hotel to chill out and get myself together before the big evening ceremony…

At the Dasashwamedh every evening, there’s a ceremony called the Ganga aarti, which is basically a prayer to the Ganges. It’s a very casual thing to do for Hindus but because this is Varanasi, it’s particularly important. People from all over have gathered around a bunch of priests waiting for 7PM to start the festivities. There are people on walls, roof tops, crowded boats and looking out from windows. We could have been about 8,000 people crammed in there. Some guy, named Sarank stood next to me. “Do you mind if I talk with you?” Here we go. We talked about Native Americans and why he shouldn’t call them “Red Indians” and he told me his hobby was to speak to foreigners. In fact, he ended up chatting with about ten foreigners in my immediate area. He was also very amused with my pronunciation of “Bundelkhand”. I was polite and didn’t say anything about his English…

The ceremony itself is a very spiritual occasion but nothing much happens. Priests were holding fire in various recipients while dancing a kind of Macarena to the sound of drums and chanting. People chanted along and clapped their hands. The heat was unbearable as I could feel my arms literally burning. And it was night time! I decided to cut short the ceremony like most of the crowd and headed back up the ghat. The crowd was very dense and I couldn’t work myself a way through it until a cow came out of nowhere and pushed people out of its way. Sadhus would pray at it, bystanders would be startled to see it and police officers were amused to see it push through the metal detectors. I used it as my personal icebreaker and followed it. Not too close though as it’s always a good idea to keep a healthy distance from a cow’s derriere. On my way back, I had fun playing hide and seek with goats, cows and the occasional stray puppy but I spent the most time watching a bunch of kids packed around a TV set playing what seemed to be a classic Nintendo video game. They were so captivated that they didn’t even notice me.

I plan on spending the evening at the hotel: shower, soda, maybe some food and a bit of reading. I’m getting up early tomorrow to try to get a boat to see the ghats in the morning sunlight.

Daily nugget: Walking back to the hotel, I’m stopped on my track by a bunch of ten-year-olds holding me back. “Bomb”. “There’s a bomb?” and then the loudest firecracker exploded near a pool of mud leaving more smoke in the air than the incense from the aarti. My hearing’s back, now.

Asia » India » Uttar Pradesh » Allahabad
September 28th 2012
Published: September 28th 2012


I have been quiet yesterday because I was not in the mood to get out of the hotel. Here’s why.

After my last entry I had dinner on a tree top (I’m not kidding) with a nice view of the temples of Khajuraho and went to bed watching Wanted on Star Movies (That’s the only channel along with National Geographic that is in English). I woke up to the face of Nicolas Cage (I hadn’t turned the TV off…) and left the hotel after a pretty good night.

Breakfast was quick because I had an early train and the corn flakes were stale. The rickshaw driver stopped at a gas station for what seemed to be ages and I finally got in line for a general ticket to Mahoba where I would take a sleeper class train to Allahabad. The line was long and didn’t move much which made me worried I’d missed the train that was already docked on the platform. Just 5 minutes before scheduled departure, I got my ticket and rushed to find a comfortable seat for the next hour.

The Mahoba station seems to be in the middle of nowhere as you can see some kind of palatial structure on the horizon kilometers away. I sat on a bench waiting for my next train, the 11;16 Chambal Express, between a woman sleeping and a cart selling fried snacks in newspapers. I had to fend off some stray dogs who were getting too close because of the fried snacks…

The train left at 11:30. Fifteen minute-delay is OK, I guess. I climbed onto the upper berth I had reserved and went straight to sleep. It’s kind of cozy up there. I built my own fort with my bags and was left alone. People wouldn’t have noticed me if it weren’t for my white ankle sticking out above the walkway. I woke up a few hours later and munched on some cookies as lunch (I haven’t been very hungry since I arrived here…). Travelling on the upper berth is a great experience as you can literally see the world from above and watch the families do their own thing. There was lots of snoring, kids playing and jumping, the ticket controller walking around, food unpacked from containers and the incessant ballet of tea, cold drinks and snack sellers at each stop.

At one point we were stuck for about an hour in a half in the middle of nowhere, nobody knew when the train would leave but it didn’t bother anyone. It’s the usual snafu here. My prayers to the god of trains (there are more than 30 million gods in Hinduism, there’s probably one for trains) were answered with about an hour and a half to go. We arrived in Allahabad in total darkness, at 7PM instead of 4:30 after a bit of pocket lamp frenzy (where’s my camera?!) to the accompanying sound of loud farts courtesy of berth 23. I upgraded my usual hotel choice and took a nice shower in a clean bathroom. I even ordered room service for dinner to watch some cricket (that Chris Gayle’s pretty good).

After a bit of laundry, I headed out into the city. As usual, rickshaw drivers tried to collectively rob me of a few hundred rupees but Tom-the-Canadian-negotiator got one for a fair 50 rupees. Nice job.

Allahabad is situated at the confluence of three rivers: the Ganges, the Yamuna and an invisible underground river called the Saraswati. It’s a tremendously holy spot for Hindus and as we got closer to the river (the Sangam), it got crowded with pilgrims, handicapped beggars hoping for some spiritual spirit and souvenir stalls selling crap and bottles to bring some holy water home. I finally got to see my first elephant, blessing pilgrims for a few rupees new Akbar’s Fort on the riverbank. There’s a group of underground shrines hidden inside the fort, near a holy banyan tree. You need to walk under a wobbly scaffolding to reach it. I started feeling some bad vibes coming from the entrance of the underground shrines. One guy was eyeing me from a distance so he could keep me shoes, the other so he could make me some change for the idols, and one so he could put some red powder on my forehead. And none of these come for free of course. I decided to skip the shrines and go directly to the riverbank.

At the river, I was predictably assaulted by all of the boat owners. Thankfully, I chipped in with Jai and Mr Chowdry so we could get our one boat for 500 rupees. They are electrical engineers from Delhi who turned out to be the nicest and most helpful people I’ve met over here. The boat took us to the confluence itself were people would bathe into the holy waters (Jai did it, Mr Chowdry has “allergies”) and/or give an offering to the river aboard a newspaper ship. We even saw two couples get married. Mr Chowdry was disgusted to see a guy wash his mouth with the river water and spill it all out: that’s not a way to behave with holy waters. I took a few photos to send to Jai (got his e-mail!) then we headed back.

Jai and Mr Chowdry were nice enough to negotiate a tempo for the three of us so that we could go to Anand Bhavan, the Nehrus’ family home. It was a detour for them but they were willing to come with me, at least for the conversation. Once there we took a last picture of Jai and I holding hands in front of Anand Bhavan (like Lord Mountbatten and Nehru, he said) and they went back to their hotel. After a short vegetarian biryani lunch, while waiting for the place to open (they have lunch hours…), I walked around the beautifully kept gardens, watched over by attentive guards (Pffffiiiitttt! Don’t sit there!). The rooms of the building were left as they were with the original furniture Nehru had tea on and Ghandi slept on, and there’s a small museum on the outside. A lot of kids came up to me for pictures and I was in a good mood. When too big a crowd gathered around me, the guards intervened so they could leave me alone. I didn’t mind…

A short walk took me to a park with the Allahabad Museum. It was hot and pretty early so it was worth a shot. There’s not much inside but they have nice miniatures and paintings, enough for an hour walk. The museum was guarded by armed soldiers with automatic rifles. One brushed past me and startled me: I flipped out for half a second, enough to have a gun almost pointed at me. Gulp! Apart from the museum, the park has a memorial to Queen Victoria and a Library in a Colonial Gothic style.

The next cycle-rickshaw had no idea where he needed to go and took me to the bus stand. I punished him with 10 rupees. Because I couldn’t trust any more rickshaws, I ended up walking. I stopped at a shopping center for some cash, shampoo and snacks for tomorrow’s train ride. Then I headed towards Khusru Bagh, the tomb of Emperor Jahangir’s son who rebelled against his father and got his nuts cut off before being executed. Good parenting. There are three other tombs in the free-entry complex for the rest of the family. The sunset colours on the tombs’ red stone was very much worth the walk.

The way back was more chaotic. I had to cross the train station to get to the other side but I was caught in general over-the-top rush hour. Pedestrians couldn’t even move. Cows stayed put and buses kept honking. It was the most congested street I have ever seen.

The day has come to an end in Allahabad as I am about to order some food again to watch cricket in my comfy air conditioned room (Australia vs India!). This has been the dustiest day of my trip so far as my black sockes have turned brown and my brown shoes (“Nike!” as one guy put it instead of the usual “Hello!”) turned beige. I haven’t seen a foreigner in two days which will probably change when I get to Varanasi tomorrow.

Daily nugget: As I stepped out of the boat at Sangam, a kid came up to me with a metal box. I was expecting to see some crap inside that he would want to sell me but instead I was greeted by a smiling cobra, inches from my arm. Probably as scary as the rifle…

Taj Mahal
Uttar Pradesh

25/09 to 26/09: Agra: The Taj Mahal



Beautiful monument and great at sunset, it has been build by Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal who died giving birth to their 14th child in 1631!

A World Heritage Site since 1983, it looks immaculate as when it was first constructed. Non-polluting vehicles have been introduced around the site to avoid pollution and preserved the Taj. To be truthful visiting the Taj Mahal felt more like a chore than a real desire - until we encountered the beauty of this wonderous complex. It was simply stunning...
27/09 to 30/09: Varanasi :



Regarded as the holiest indian city, you will love it or hate it. Wandering in the little alleyways around the ghats, people watching sitting on the steps of the ghats, offering Puja on the river Ganga, watching a cremation, watch buffalo bathing, people bathing...

Hindus come here to wash away their sins or cremate their loved ones. Being crematd in Varanasi does liberate Hindi's from the cycle of death and rebirth. The wood used to burn the body can be expensive as it takes more than
Taj Mahal
3 hours to be reduce to ash. Dogs are sniffing around hoping for some flesh to be left. The cremation is open to public and touts are asking for donation. The people turning the wood are part of the Untouchable cast. More impressive than the smell is the explosion of the intestine and stomach that create a shock. No picture is allowed of course for privacy of the family and respect. Certain types of people can't be burned and therefore are 'Cremated at sea/river' into the Ganga: Pregnant women, Children under the age of 10, Lepers, Saddhus are including in the list of 'Exceptions'

When the river is not high, you can easily walk along the ghats, there are 80 in total. The famous one are Manikarnila for the funeral procession on the streets: body are walked on the streets to the Ganga, and Dasawamedh ghat for the prayer/offering ceremony.


Sarnath:


Buddha came here to preach his message of Nirvana and monks did live here in large monasteries. Muslim invaders ransacked the town and Sarnath disappeared being discovered by the British archaeologists in 1835. Stupas and Monastery Ruins are found here. Definitely worth a visit.

Today was ""Know your Mughal Emperor Day"" for me. Akbar, Shah Jahan, Jahangir... I'm getting pretty good at it. On the schedule today: Taj Mahal, Akbar's Tomb and Fatehpur Sikri.

First of all, the night was tough and will need some getting used to. The world's loudest cricket decided to park in front on my window, for some reason all the lights in my room cannot be turned off simultaneously and a power outage at 3:30 caused the noisy fan to stop turning. Cue the heat. Enough to wake me up.

I got in line for the Taj at 6AM. Right before a busload of Chinese tourists came crowding the queuing area. I've been to the Taj before but it's simply unmissable. If you don't really care about seeing the Taj in the morning sky, go early at least for the temperature. Warm but cozy. I easily spent 2 hours just walking in the garden, enjoying the views and making videos.

Back to the hotel for a (kind of) healthy breakfast of garlic omelette and lime soda. Quick shower and off I go to Akbar's Tomb 15kms away. Negotiation time: I managed to bring down the rickshaw trip to 250 rupees but the driver said ""275, there's 25 for parking at tomb"". Mmm. Here's what we'll do: 250 and I pay the 25 directly to the parking agent. ""OK, 250"" he said. In the end, as I suspected, parking was free. I gave myself a pat in the back :-)

By the way, my name is Tom and I'm Canadian. That's my new ""Please-don't-hurt-me"" identity. There's a strong population of Muslims in this part of the country and I don't want to take my chances. Bad timing to be French AND American.

Akbar's Tomb is off the map in the guide. Literally. It's far but totally worth it. The red stone and white marble structure is both peaceful and monumental. The gardens are full of wildlife. Parrots, peacocks, squirrels and even antelopes! You can have the area pretty much for yourself if you go early enough but you can still have some awkward encounters. A man just stood behind me as I was sitting down applying sunscreen on my legs. He was staring me down like it was a peep show. Plain weird.

Options for luch were limited around the Idgah bus stand so I settled for a hotel restaurant. I could use a tiny bit of comfort and air conditioning. My paleness seemed to have illuminated the lobby of the hotel as the dozen people who were there just turned toward me and froze. The Igdah bus stand is REALLY off the map in the guide... They opened the restaurant for me and I munched down an excellent vegetarian byriani.

The bus ride to Fatehpur Sikri was more enjoyable than I had feared. Open windows cooled down the inside and I wasn't stared at too much. The countryside is interesting. That's good, because there's no way you can sleep with that bumpiness (As I am writing this, a grasshopper the size of a Bic lighter just flew into the internet cafe and landed on my leg!).

Fatehpur Sikri is a must-see but avoid seeing it if you're not comfortable with touts, fake guides, etc... It wasn't a very welcoming city today. The mosque is free but people try to make you pay to get in. I had to push away about a dozen ""employees of the mosque"" who turned out to be working for the souvenir shops. I got screamed at for walking in a scared area holding my shoes in a bag. My fault, but I could have used not having the attention of upset Muslims. The palace complex is safer for walking around as it isn't free. It's also very peaceful and well-preserved. The visit lasted about two hours. Back to the bus station where I managed to slalom around misinformation from ill-intentioned taxi drivers/restaurateurs/souvenir shop workers/overall crooks to find the right bus leaving at the right time.

In Agra, a rickshaw driver didn't know who he was dealing with. ""Take me to the Taj, EAST GATE"". Of course he takes me to the West Gate, wich is closer but at the complete opposite of where I want to go. He starts involving a cycle-rickshaw who tells me ""he can't go further. I take you, free of charge"". I get into ""Don't mess with Tom the Canadian""-mode and threaten to get the police involved. When a gun-carrying policeman came over they cut the crap. Off to the East Gate!

A quick glance at the Taj at sunset and it was shower time again.

Daily nugget:
One local ice cream company got the clever but not so subtle idea to call itself ""Ven & Jerry's"". Is Ven really a name?

(Ahh! that grasshopper landed on me again!)

Finally, the time has come. I've been planning this trip for over a year now and I am still strugging to realize where I am. I am sitting in a makeshift internet cafe near the East Gate of the Taj Mahal. My first day is nearing its end. I was afraid I wouldn't get my reflexes back from when I was last in India 4 years ago but somehow everything seems both exotic and familiar.

My British Airways flights were both uneventful and unimportant. Kudos to New Delhi for having a clean and efficient international terminal.

I booked a prepaid taxi to take me to my cousin Henri's appartment in New Delhi, but when he started negotiating with another Indian passenger looking for a ride while I was in the back seat, I knew this might be a bumpy ride literally AND figuratively. Midnight traffic in Delhi is quite fluid. I started working on my animal checklist (First stray dogs: on the highway divider coming from the airport. Check!).

Addresses in India don't seem like an exact science. And you're often better off asking to be dropped off at a nearby ""landmark"" than the actual address. In this case: the police station of my cousin's neighborhood. Easier said than done: He stank at directions (and just plain stank also). I'm pretty sure the driver insulted me in a local language and he even asked me for extra money because he had to go through detours before finding the destination. I played my tough guy card and he caved.

Finally at Henri's! He lives with an Indian-American girl (not the Pocahontas kind) in an appartment in a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood. Between the chit-chat and the preparations for the next steps of the trip (namely the Shatabdi Express to Agra at 6AM), we stayed up until the new taxi came to bring me to the train station. I'm looking forard to spending more time with Henri when I get back to Delhi for the end of the trip.

ADVICE FOR TRAVELERS: Don't trust people who approach you directly. If you have a question, ask someone. One guy was all ""Mister! Mister!"" with me, claiming that the ""WS"" on my ticket meant ""Wait for seat"" and that I was on a waiting list... Yeah right. I played my second tough guy card and powered to the platform. People sleeping on the floor, groups of tourists gathering around their guides, Chai-wallahs preparing for morning rush hour: it all brings back memories. I'm definitely not in unknown territory.

The train ride was good. You even get a bottle, a morning tea or coffe and a little breakfast (Cutlets with toast). It seemed like every time I started to nod off, the waiter would put something on my table. I was rubbing elbows with a teenage girl who was charging her phone on the wall next to me, and actualy seemed to like it...

Once in Agra, I jumped into the prepaid rickshaw of the, as I discovered, highly recommended KK. The friendly conversation turned into a sales pitch for his 1-day tour of Agra service, using references from other tourists written on a bunch of old and used paper that looked more like the Dead Sea scrolls than a notebook. I blind-sided him with my nice guy card: sorry not interested.

Hotel Sheela near the East Gate of the Taj Mahal can boast a great location but a mediocre double standard room (I don't mind). They have a quiet courtyard with a decent restaurant (Lower your expectations, people!). We'll see how the night goes.

I tried sleeping for a bit (failed). And decided to go find a quiet place to eat: had curry paneer at a roof top restaurant which was neither on the roof of the building nor on the top. Friendly staff with straight-to-the-point food. The name of the restaurant? ""The Food Restaurant""...

First stop: Agra Fort. 300 rupees for foreigners. Not surprisingly, someone comes to me asking to be my guide. ""You know what? I'm kind of in the mood for it"". 70-year-old Aziz was very likeable, probably very knowledgeable but unfortunately not that interesting: most of what he said I already knew or was just written throughout the Fort anyways. I had to fork out a shameful amount to pay him but I don't necessarily regret it. He makes for good TV (holiday movies at least). The Fort itself is beautiful and you can sense the grandeur of its heyday. A must-see.

Next stop: Chini-Ka-Waza (probably not spelled right). Meh. Anywhere else it would stand out but here, it just doesn't compare to the rest. The Baby Taj was my next destination. It's shaped like a jewelry box of marble encrusted with semi-precious stones and painted in bright colours. A major architecture breakthrough that eventually inspired the Taj Mahal. The gardens around the Tomb are lovely and I spent most of the time lounging on benches reading, drinking water and watching families enjoy their time. The inside is gorgeous and peaceful and is definitely worth the ""shoes-off"" visit. (First monkeys: clowning around the walls of the gardens. Check!).

For the way back, I trusted the scrawny legs of a cycle rickshaw to go all the way to the hotel. The poor man struggled, even as I pushed the cycle with him in hills. Eventually we got there and I was able to take a good well-deserved low pressure lukewarm shower. Nice!

Daily nugget: unusual graffittis on the Delhi highway. They're like giant public twitter updates. Here's a sample:
- ""I just want U back :-(""
- ""I hate my life""
- ""Please forgive me""

A ridiculously early start for the second morning running. This time to see the Taj Mahal at sunrise. As it had rained on our way to Agra we had opted to see it at sunrise not sunset. Leaving the hotel at 5:45am it was light, relatively cooler and the streets were quiet. Our walk down the road to the nearest point that vehicles can get to the Taj (it got discoloured by pollution so they had to clean it with some ancient recipie, now polluting vehicles aren't allowed within a couple of hundred metres) was really enjoyable.

There was no queue at the ticket booth so we quickly had our (expensive 750 rupee) tickets and had collected our 'free' shoe covers and bottle of water. We joined the ladies queue to go through the security check. The gates opened at 6am and of course we were in the shortest queue. We had been told by our driver that certain things (such as knives and food) are not allowed - but as we went through the bag check Marie was told her torch was not allowed and neither was her gorilla tripod. A police officer then said yes he would permit

the torch and that he would look after the tripod saving us from either binning it or heading back out to put it in a locker somewhere then to queue again. We were appropriately grateful for letting the torch in and he took the tripod and threw it up into an alcove for us to collect later.

The crowds were not bad at all and as we entered we got a full panoramic view of the ghostly building. Initially the light was not that strong making photos difficult as it is looks like an appartition but we took our time to take this initial view in and appreciate the scale of the place. It is as magnificent as you imagine.

As the sun slowly emerged the air got steamy and we took a closer look at the amazing detail. There are some really neat things about it's construction aside from its incredible beauty - the text that runs up to frame the door way does not look smaller the further away it is from you, that's because they made the text bigger at the top so as you look up you can still read it. Six sided columns
Photo 36
become 4 sided with the detailed decoration making it look all the same. Aside from the classic shots across the gardens we were really interested in some other views and the details of the architecture.

The sun rose to give a really nice light (and made us incredibly sweaty as the wet grass dried out) and revealed just how white and beautiful it is. We spent a good while wandering around slowly and taking it in.

By the time we walked back the streets had come alive again, breakfast at the hotel was spicy pasta or curry (neither of which we were impressed about) baked beans and a boiled egg- not the continental breakfast we were supposed to get but we ate knowing we probably wouldn't want lunch as it would be too hot.

Flight number 'we've lost count' involved an early start. It was dark when we got up and there was a powercut but luckily we thought this might be the case and had already packed most of our stuff up and had a torch and candle on standby.

Being in Jammu and Kashmir Leh airport has heightened security. You have to show your itinerary and passport to armed police to get into the airport, then show them again to more police before putting your bags through the scanner. Where you also walk through a scanner and get frisked (women get a curtain and disappointingly they didn't do a very thorough job). On to check in then show boarding card and passport to go to another security check area where hand luggage and you go through another scanner and then get frisked again (women behind a curtain again). This time you get a stamp on your boarding card and hand luggage tag. Then the person with the luggage tickets on their boarding card has to go to the outside security area and identify the checked in bags. Don't identify them and they wont be loaded 'for secuirty reasons.' Then you wait in a smallish boarding area that continuously fills with people. There is some entertainment, guys don't get the privacy of a curtain so you can sit and watch them getting frisked.

Confusingly when you book the flight you're told you are not allowed to take any hand luggage on. At the airport there are signs saying the same thing but that you can take your camera and laptop on. At the first luggage check Marie was made to take the spare batteries out of her bag and put them into her big bag, we were confused but did as we were told. So it turns out that despite what everything says that yes you can take hand luggage on just in the more traditional sense eg handbag, small rucksack.

Exiting the lounge to board bottles of water were taken off us (other liquids weren't checked), boarding passes and hand luggage tags checked for stamps to say they were cleared and then queue again to get another stamp on each, then get frisked again, put on a bus, driven 300m to the plane to get on, passes and tags checked again under the watchful eye of the police.

Apparently flights arrive and leave from Leh so early because after about 10:30am the weather up there is not conducive to flying. It is a pretty cool place to fly in or out of. After taking off we weaved our way throught he mountains until safely above them where we got tantalising glances of the snow capped peaks below through the clouds.

We were met a Delhi airport by our driver as arranged with the agency. He took us to the office in the city centre where we got our loose itinerary, hotel vouchers and settled the expensive bill. Getting into Delhi took ages but getting out too even longer. It is a different perspective driving through the chaos in a car and we are not that is entirely comfortable observing people eeking out a living behind a sheet of glass. We did see an elephant walking down the main streets of Delhi.

It was as hot as hell and the aircon couldn't compete with the sun and Indian roads have a speed limit of 60km. 186km on good (by our standard) roads took us 5 long hours. We were knackered, not enjoying being back in a hot, humid environment or being harassed by vendors and people with monkeys (photos) when we stopped briefly to pay road tax. Or the lunch stop restaraunt that charged 60 rupees for a tea (that's twice the price of a nice restaraunt), and tried to make us buy the most expensive thing on the menu despite us saying we weren't hungry. Then having the cheek to stick a 15% service charge on. Followed by using the toilet only for a woman to nab Emma on the way out by throwing dry tissue into her wet hands after she washed them and demanding 100 rupees (to give that context in tourist sites you pay 5 rupees to use the toilet). Emma actually laughed, the woman then gestured that 50 rupees was ok and Emma indignantly said 'I'm not paying 50 rupees for a pee!'. Fair enough, over $1 for a pee is a bit much and since it came on the back of buying the very expensive tea it was all too much for Emma. We had some kids persistantly beg with faces pressed against the car window as we were stuck in traffic for what seemed like eternity and our 'helpful' driver tells us things we already know because of course he wants a tip at the end. We were slightly over it and pining for the mountains.

It rained as we began to approach Agra and this made us happier as it cooled the air slightly. Just the sun going in made a difference, making it more bearable. We were tired and somewhat grumpy, dreaming of Leh when we got to the hotel, we took our bags up to the room despite the porter offering several times, (because you have to tip them) sure it's not much money but you can hemmorage money if you tip for everything and it's not something we can afford to do given the tour is costing an arm and a leg. The air con remote wasn't in our roon so the porter went to get it and then expected a tip...

Dinner at the hotel restaraunt (we were too knackered to go looking for food) took over an hour to get everything we ordered and we were the first in there - getting a roti took a record time of almost an hour and still the waiter wanted a tip... we hate it, we understand why, it's because they are not paid much most of the time but supporting a tipping culture is only going to exacerbate that not fix it. We just want to know what something costs and we expect when we pay for something that people are paid fairly, particularly when we are already paying a lot of money for something.

Lost in thought
So what about India, then? I suppose I should squeeze her in on my dance card, and not before time to be honest. Indira Gandhi once said of Mother India she cannot understand how one can be an Indian and not be proud. It's great to finally arrive in Incredible India; a country that will shock, titillate, enthral and enrage in equal measure. To gain an understanding of India one must compress the concept of a close call by a factor of ten. Two guys being knocked by a bus, but not knocked down. A guy being sideswiped by a car's side mirror, a guy having his foot run over by a motorbike. There's no real harm done, but that's an Indian close call. When you have over one billion people in a country there's no margin for error, and travellers are confronted by the most extraordinary scenes of daily living you are ever likely to encounter. Yet the Indian people coexist peacefully, and get on with their daily lives with a minimum of fuss, and a seemingly infinite reserve of patience.

Now where were we then, dear reader? The journal left off in Dhaka, at the conclusion of a
Taj Mahal
memorable visit with my Japanese friend. We went to the airport together for our respective flights, and farewelled each other at the departure gates. She's off to Calcutta, and my destination is the capital New Delhi. The three hour flight was comfortable, and I was met at the airport by the driver from Hostel New King. I chose accommodation in the very heart of Delhi on the Main Bazar. The manager Suny greeted me on arrival, and had things organised for my two day stay in a jiffy. I dumped my bags and went downstairs for an introductory tour of the city with the hostel driver, and it was a great afternoon. India's capital has 22 million people, just about Australia's population, so as you can imagine it's a real eye opener getting out and about. We started off at the Indira Gandhi museum, and it was interesting to visit the former Prime Minister's home. And I must say what a brazen act of treachery it was when two security guards gunned her down in the grounds of her own home. We went to the Lodhi gardens where I strolled around the impressive grounds, visited the amazing Lotus temple which
Chilling at the Taj Mahal
is the mother temple of the Indian subcontinent, took in India Gate for a bit of Parisian style grandeur, and visited a bazar. I had a great afternoon thanks to my kind and informative driver.

However, this was just the warm up act for a mighty day in India the following morning from 7:00am. My research indicates the best way to take in the glorious Taj Mahal in Agra is from a tour out of Delhi. It's 210 kilometres from the capital, but a five hour car drive each way, so travellers are in for a very long day on the road. Travelling on Indian roads is never short on entertainment value, so just being in the pasenger seat is an enthralling experience in itself. Nothing can prepare a first time visitor for the glory and majesty of the Taj Mahal, and on the drive down there's not the slightest inkling such a magnificent tourist attraction could be in the vicinity. But once you catch that first glimpse of the marble dome, all I can say is holy cow!



The Taj Mahal is the bomb. Surely it has to be the most beautiful structure in the
Taj Mahal
world. Set in gorgeous grounds, the monument includes tastefully designed buildings on it's perimeter. The marble of the Taj changes colour depending on the light, and I'm delighted to be here. Of course there are hordes of people around, but hey, this is India! During my visit I snapped away manically from various angles, but spent most of my time gawking in wonder at this magical monument. Indians at the Taj are friendly, and keen to pose for photos with an Aussie rock star! I even got to plug my blog with a few young lads, who assured me they would check it out. Tourists get to walk around the structure, and visit inside the mausoleum. I spent an enthralling three hours at the site, and then hauled ass back to the carpark to meet my driver, as we still had to negotiate the five hour commute back to the country's main town.

Anyways, a visit to the capital and Agra's world class tourist attraction have been wonderful, but I had to get a wriggle on. So next morning I headed back to the superb Indira Gandhi International airport (recently opened and voted number two airport in the world)
Hindu ceremony on the ganga
for a flight to the holy city of Varanasi. It only takes an hour, and the passengers disembarked in fierce heat. I jumped a taxi to the excellent Suraj guest house in the maze of streets near the sacred Ganjes, and once again the locals had me sorted regarding tours with impressive efficiency. The Indians are doing a fine job of lightening my wallet, and seem to be masters of this delicate art form. Once again I dumped my bags on arrival, and was off with my guide. Sometimes this travelling caper can be exhausting, let me tell you! The young champion led me around the maze of streets, we stopped off for an excellent meal, then boarded a boat moored on the sacred ganga for the evening ceremony. The hour long hindu performance was watched by a huge crowd of Indians, with concurrent swarms of tourists on the boats for a view from the water. The ganga is the most sacred river for Hindus, and I saw Indian pilgrims dunk themselves in the river with due reverence. However, the mighty ganga flows for 2525 kilometres on to Bangladesh, before she empties in the Bay of Bengal. As such the
Crowds gather on the ganga
pollution levels in the river are dangerously high, because the ganga is the most heavily populated river in the world, sustaining as it does some 400 million people.

Varanasi is an extraordinary city, and known as the oldest inhabited city on earth. Walking along the maze of streets is great fun, with holy cows to squeeze past, holy men to ease past, and a plethora of vibrant city living to be pleased with. The next morning we headed out at the unholy start time of 5:00am, whereupon I staggered through the streets after my guide. We were up early to witness the cremation ceremony, where deceased persons are sent off to the afterlife on a wooden funeral pyre. The visit to historic Varanasi concluded when I entered the site of the Buddhist stupas and temples at Sarnath. This is where the buddha is believed to have lived, and is an important site for the people of India.

My introduction to this incredible country leaves an impression of being slightly overwhelmed. The sheer scale of humanity buzzing with life in Incredible India assails the senses during every waking moment, and people watching in this vast country leads to many
Hindu ceremony
amazing scenes. As an added bonus Indians are kind and generous hosts happy to welcome visitors to their beloved country, basically all of you should be here now!


First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they attack you. Then you win."" Mahatma Gandhi


As I continue my travels, until next time it's signing off for now

Leaving the calm state of Sikkim was not done lightly and as we sit here sweating in the streets of Varanasi as a cow waltzes past shit trailing in its wake, we still wish we were there in the cool town of Darjeeling, gazing out across the Mountains, cold glass of beer in hand.

After a bumpy ride back down to Siliguri, along steep mountain roads and flooded paths we eventually arrived at New Jailapurgi Junction to catch a train to Mughal Sarai, a train station close to Varanasi. Turns out its very hard to get a ticket on the day, and the ease in which we got the last ticket is due to the fact that no one wants to leave or visit the calamitous capital of the state of Assam.

We managed to get a general ticket which apparently means we were on the waiting list, although we didn't find this out until later. The train was then 3 hours delayed, which is obviously common in England but would have frequent users of England's national rail service in hysterics verging on convulsions.

We hopped on the first AC carriage to find the TT man (ticket man) to see whether we could get a ticket. We couldn't. We then raced through the train to find a spare 3 seats. We couldn't.

Rail users are very helpful in India and as we barged past along narrow walk ways with our heavy bags they told us that we just need to find a spare seat, put our stuff on it and wait for the TT man.

We found a spare seat (they are bed like) in the sleeper carriage, which much to Jamie's dismay only have fans and no AC fast forward to a very sweaty train journey!

We squished onto the seat, perched precariously infront of our bags and waiting for the TT man. He didn't come for about three ours and in that time the other guys in our area let Jamie sit on their beds. When the TT man finally came he told us we couldn't stay all one bed and he would go and find us another.

At about midnight, once Olivia and I had finally found the right sitting pattern and had even managed a short doze the TT man finally made a reappearance. It turns out the bed Jamies was lounging on was actually the bed of the guy that had been helping us the most!

Whilst they couldn't find us three beds, they could find one for Jamie in the next door bay. There was a family of 10 sleeping on 5 of the beds, and once they had dragged three of the children of one of them Jamie was able to have a legitamate bed!

Eight hours and 500 rupees, one future reading, one one-sided chat with an old woman and countless introductions from people in our carriage and others (seems our fame had spread) we finally leapt of the train at Mughal Sarai where we booked our next train to avoid the status of stowaway happening again.

We journeyed into Varanasi in a Tuk tuk (sat in a few still not driven one!) to find our next hostel. We are currently staying in Monalisa Peace Cottage which even comes with resident monkeys and night time singing, bell-ringing prayer ceremonies.

Last night we went to our local Ghat, Dhamesdheva Ghat to watch a hindu Ganga ceremony, where there was also a funeral.

We have had lots of pleasant wanders which include the usual Indian salesman that take you around to the Golden Temple, Nepali Temple and his shop (fortunately we managed to loose him before we had to go to his shop which obviously meant that we also got very lost). This morning we went to Surthan where there is a Buddist Temple which has a sampling from the meditation tree. This afternoon we are going to the Burning Ghat in the hope of seeing more dead bodies.

Love from

Chatty, Jamie and Olivia

After a nice few days in Dharamsala (Mcleod Ganj) I got a bus down into the Punjab to Amritser home to the holy Sikh Golden Temple – after the Taj Mahal probably one of the most visited sites in India and probably the world – visited by literally thousands of pilgrims daily! Amritser is a lot lower down in altitude after the hills of Himachal Pradesh and also hot and sticky – around 30 degrees and about 70%!h(MISSING)umidity. It’s a city of about a million people and very cluttered and busy although the old city which is where the Golden Temple is is quite compact and is a collection of narrow medieval streets and lanes.

The temple has a long and checkered history over its 250 year odd history. The large golden dome that gives the temple its name is said to be gilded with 750kg of pure gold! Interlaid with marble. Priests inside the temple keep up a continuous and soothing chant from the Sikh holy book. Its worth visiting the temple throughout the day as to see the varying light changes and at night it is superbly lit. Also while at the Golden Temple I experienced the community dining hall where again thousands of pilgrims and visitors to the temple can enjoy a simple (and free) meal prepared in the huge kitchen with enormous cauldrons of dal, vegetables and rice etc, an incredible feat or feast!

Also while in Amritser it is worth taking a simple tour to the Indian border with Pakistan, about 30km away for the entertaining nightly closing of the border ceremony. This is where members of the Indian and Pakistani border military engage in a 20 minute display of pure theatre watched and cheered on by hundreds of spectators on each side complete with grandstands! The entertainment stands with music and performers and spectators waving national flags. Then on cue a squad of soldiers stomp out of the complex donning silly hats and parade up and down the concourse kicking the air so high that they almost hit their faces in a march vaguely reminiscent of Monty Python’s Ministry of Silly Walks sketch rousing thunderous applause from the spectators. The border gates are then flung open and the commanding officers of both countries shake hands and salute and then the flags of both countries are simultaneously lowered and the gates shut. The border is then closed for the night.

After a couple of nights in Amritser I got a train to Delhi. I was in 2nd class air con for the 6 hour evening journey and while on board enjoyed tea, dinner of soup, dal, rice, vegetable curry and chapatti followed by ice cream all included in the cost.

In Delhi its easy to get to the sights by whizzing around on the Metro. On Indian Independence Day (August 15) I had a look at the imposing India Gate – a large arch in the centre of New Delhi and memorial to the 90,000 or so Indian solders that lost their lives in WW1. Under the arch is an eternal memorial flame and in the evening the large garden area comes alive with buskers and stalls of every sort selling ice creams and other Indian snacks.

Also visited the impressive National Museum featuring extensive collections of ancient archeological artefacts from early civilizations of the Indus valley (Northern India and what is now Pakistan) dating back around 3000 BC. The museum also features lots of mediaeval art and paintings as well tribal artefacts, coins, textiles and weapons well worth a half day. This I followed up with high tea at the Imperial Hotel where for about 800 rupees (about $16) you can tuck into all of the scones (complete with clotted cream), pastries and sandwiches that you can eat and of course a fine selection of Indian and international teas – perfect before heading off by train to Agra to have another lot at the Taj Mahal. After that I have another couple of days in Delhi before my flight to Kuala Lumpur on Sunday night.

To find the Burning Ghat walking through the intricate web of Varanasi's alleyways we followed the pungent smell of burning flesh, and the odd whisp of smoke floating over the cow houses and temples that lined Varanasi's streets.

Olivia and Jamie (I had already been) were very eager to visit Varanasi's main attraction after the Footprint pages (Olivia is also a wiki-aholic) painted such an exotic image of colourful funeral processions and load chanting of cremation prayers.

Varanasi is experiencing high water levels at present which means the river is empty of boats due to the ferocious rip tide. As such the ghats are still recovering from flooding with temples partly under water and flip flops embeded in the muddy path ways coming to and from the waters edge.

To experience the Burning Ghat you need to look at it from all angles, leaving the 'crematorium' until last. When we enetered the Burning Ghat, we carried on past the staring men and groups of women mourning under colourful shades and partially flooded temples towards Scandia Guest House where we could get a better view of pilgrims washing, and men praying on the steps of the Ganges.

Scandia Guest House stands abovethe burning ghat, with the crematorium on one-side and the public loo on the other - not a place that should come recommended. Climbing up to the guest houses' patio Olivia said: 'I bet you anything if this place is in teh Lonely Planet it will say 'lovely view' in teh description!"" Sure enough it did!

A few choice photos were taken before the toxic smell of urine from the public loo became too much and we had to race back towards entrance.

Making our way back we spotted two westerners being dragged by a 'guide' (you will find people everywhere around Varanasi promising to guide you around the city and its sites - these are usually normal people after a fast buck and happy to tell you a web of lies about the hisory of the holy riverside city) towards a large pile of logs. Following them to see if they were going after the dead bodies we discovered the barn where they chop the wood for funeral pyres - the westerners were clearly unimpressed that they had just paid 400 rupees just to see this, and were busy having an arguement when we tottered off up a sloping path that overlooked the ghat. Up there we could see the line of dead bodies waiting to be cremated next to the Ganges. Their shrounds represented bright coloured saris and plenty of tinsel like cord.

As we returned to the guest house we came across a funeral procession marching through the narrow streets, forcing us to press against the spit stained walls, carrying a dead body in a hospital hammock, the two feet bobbing up and down at the end.

Olivia and Jamie were very impressed to have finally seen dead bodies and decided that completed our trip, so we spent a chilled evening reflecting on our stay in India so far.

Sangam, Allahabad
The Ganges at the back of the photo flowing from left to right is joined by the Yamuna flowing from the bottom right
Allahabad and Varanasi are both cities intimately connected with Hindu mythology. I had been following the Yamuna river from Agra, where the Taj Mahal backs onto it, to Allahabad, where three Hindu holy rivers meet. The Yamuna joins with the Ganges, and in theory so does the Saraswati, but that's mythological river.

Because of this, the confluence if the three is considered one of the most auspicious places to undertake religious bathing. Every year, usually in February, there is a mass gathering of Hindus here, called a Mela, usually in February. Every 12 years there is a particularly big gathering known as the Kumbh Mela - the next one if February 2013. The Kumbh Mela is the world's largest single gathering of people in one place - tens of millions of them. The place where it is held is a very large area of mud flats, exactly where the two rivers meet, known as Sangam.

After one night in Allahabad I moved on to Varanasi for two nights. Varanasi is an all-year-round bathing place along the river Ganges, and is also the place where ideally Hindus would like their ashes to be scattered when they are cremated. There are
Mughal tombs, Allahabad
dozens of ghats (flat steps or platforms alongside the river) where these two activities take place. Most are bathing ghats but there are a few cremation ghats and my hotel in Varanasi just happened to be right above one of them - Harishchandra Ghat - about 50 meters from the river bank. If I wanted I could simply look out of my window (I even had a little balcony) and see 3 or 4 cremations in progress. Behind the hotel is an enormous supply of wood which the relatives of the deceased must buy to have their loved one cremated here.

I walked from my hotel past 20 or so ghats towards one of the main bathing ghats. The scene here was one some ways almost reminiscent of a sunny day in the summer at an English seaside resort - hundreds of people, familes etc sitting on the ghats, eating packed lunches, with fruit, drinks, food sellers, and people offering boat rides on the river (I took one those as well).

When I arrived in Varanasi I was just getting over a particularly bad digestive problem (that's the politest way of describing it!). I hadn't eaten for two
Even buffalo bathe in the Ganges at Varanasi
days and I had felt extremely lethargic. What I really needed was somewhere where I could sit in somewhere fairly open, well ventilated, and where I could buy some really bland food! I normally love Indian food, and I had enjoyed my meals here in small local eating places, but right now I needed to let my stomach get back to normal. Luckily I happened to pass a restaurant called the Kerala Cafe. I was was very modern (well, in a 60s Wimpy Bar type of modern), large, spacious, lots of powerful fans, and best of all had lots of bland things on the menu. I started with a coffee - the best coffee I have had yet in India, then something a bit like a pizza base with coconut and onions, and finaly a gorgeous cold coffee with ice-cream. The next day I also managed to find a stall recommended by the guidebook - The Blue Lassi - absolutely heavenly lassis flavoured with almost any available fruit.

Reflection shot
I had often felt that all my previous trips and travels were gearing me up to tackle India. That somehow the chaotic cities I have experienced, the frenetic whirlwind of life and activity that other countries project, the overwhelming noise and smells, the sights these eyes have seen and the hardships endured to get to see them, were in some way a practice run to get me travel fit for India and it's 1.2billion population. It didn't work. I am still early into my trip so I will reserve judgement until the end, and it certainly hasn't helped that I chose to jump in at the proverbial deep end by starting with the tourist Meccas of Delhi, Varanasi, and Agra, but so far India has been...overwhelming? It just defies description(not helpful when blog writing), it frustrates, confounds, annoys and exasperates, even the simplest task such as going to book a train ticket becomes an energy sapping saga as the heat, noise, smells,filth, sheer number of people and the amount of people waiting to scam you all seem to conspire against you. I think I had some kind of culture shock as it took me a good few days to adjust properly,and
Varanasi ghats
initially I was truly hating the experience. It is just too intense, in your face, constant and hard work. However, once you have battled through all that India throws at you the sights are invariably worth it. It's not easy, it's not subtle and in many places it isn't pretty, but persevere and you can be rewarded.

New Delhi

The guidebook said 'give it a chance and this schizophrenic capital could capture your heart'. I tried. It didn't. It captured my last nerve instead and wouldn't let go. I don't want to be too critical because many people call it home, and maybe its just me that couldn't hack it (have not met a single traveller who liked it FYI)but I couldn't wait to get out of the place. I generally dislike big cities anyway, but have been to many chaotic places such as Bangkok, Saigon, Mexico City, Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo to name but a few, and found that all in their own way had a certain charm or good qualities to cling to. I tried to scratch beneath the surface but couldn't find any positives from Delhi. The city has 13million people in it and I
Building erotica-Khajuraho
seemed to find most of them on every street I walked, it is just too overpopulated for the size of the place. I know there is a great divide between the rich and poor in India, but I have been to places that are poorer and yet the people didn't act as I experienced in Delhi. It seems that every single person there is out to scam you or take your money in some way. You have to haggle prices for every item bought, transport used and even hotel rooms. The attention received on leaving a train station etc is sheer madness and like a scene from Rocky as people chase you down the street refusing to take your 'no thank you's, ignorance, insults or threats as anything approaching a No. Every 2 seconds someone will walk alongside you and make conversation acting friendly and chatting about India, and then at the end try to convince to go to some shop or tourism office they know. They all try and offer you the same things that you have declined from the other 50 people in the last minute. Rickshaw drivers inflate prices ten fold and more because you are a
Humayun's Tomb, Delhi
foreigner, and also join in the game of trying to take you to a different hotel than you requested as yours is 'full'. Scammers stand outside train stations and tell you the train is cancelled, or the hotel you booked is full or that the tourist office has moved, but of course they always know just where to take you to solve the problem. There are several fake 'official tourist bureaus' in the station alone. Many female backpackers have told me about being groped or having their backsides pinched when they walk the streets, and the men also ogle and take pictures on their phones of the easy European women(I know fancy complaining, bloody feminists!) while the city's nametag of the 'rape capital of India needs no explanation. You are also always wary of your valuables as pickpockets are everywhere. It's not a nice attitude or way to travel when you have to mistrust everyone and basically turn into a total dick, ignoring anyone and everyone who talks to you and being totally blunt and rude about doing so. But this is what Delhi brings out in you, and I am intrigued to see if the rest of India is
Jama Masjid mosque, Delhi
the same, I hope not.

Delhi is also without question, the dirtiest and smelliest city I have ever experienced. I find it such a huge contradiction that the people apparently love their country and city so much, but throw away litter with such careless abandon. The place is a filthy mess, and every excursion down the street needs to be conducted with military precision to avoid stepping in or on something. The city itself is decrepit, seeming to crumble at the seams, it may be called New Delhi but it looks like the oldest city I've ever seen as the majority of buildings are either in a state of ruin, crumbling or already collapsed. It is unbearably noisy, mainly due to the cars, taxis and rickshaws who use the horn as though a conduit, I'd be surprised if anyone uses phones over here because they all seem to communicate through beeps. The train stations are horrendous, they resemble some kind of refugee camp and can be intimidating and strange places to go when you are the only foreigner in the vicinity. Currently it is also unbearably warm, sticky and humid as the city awaits the monsoon, not that Delhi
Agra Fort, Delhi
can be blamed for that mind but I'm on a roll so let me have it.

So apart from all that Delhi was ok, cough. As I said, if you get through all the crap (literally) then there are some good sights. The Red Fort was fairly interesting and easy on the eye, although I think the best views were from outside or even above, as the actual fort walls and gate was more interesting than inside it. There was some lovely architecture and easy to imagine this shah ruling over the people from his marble throne. It was also a good insight into delhi though because the fort was actually built by a Mughal shah, and the Jama Masjid mosque is of course Muslim, whilst other features were made by the British. Thus you have Delhi described, a city crumbling and ruined living off the remnants of lost empires, many of which aren't their own. Meow I am a right bitch!! I think in another city I would glorify in the multi faceted and codependent religious nature of the place and how it is all intertwined, but I just can't bring myself to be overly positive about Delhi.
Ghandi's last steps
Jama Masjid was the most impressive, a huge mosque that can hold a mind boggling 25,000 people and was built In the 1600's. Its massive main square would be an impressive sight when full with everyone praying but sadly attendance was low that day. The view from the 40metre high minarets afforded a good look out across this massive sprawling city. I also visited Humayun's Tomb, another Mughal construction from the 16th century. It was a pretty building of sandstone and marble topped by a huge dome, surrounded by a huge garden and other smaller tombs. The Gandhi museum was also interesting in a slightly morbid sense as it was the house he spent his last days in, they have left his room as it was that day showing his few worldly remains, whilst outside concrete footsteps lead to the place in his garden where he was shot dead. A simple yet powerful monument now stands on this spot where the 'father of India' was murdered by a zealot not long after India gained independence. I wonder what he would make of Delhi and its peoples antics today. The food in Delhi was also good and I highly recommend the
Martyrdom
easy to navigate, air conditioned and considerably cheaper metro as a way of moving around Delhi, it can be busy but beats a rickshaw. My hotel in Pahargang called Cottage Yes Please (indian hotel names are amazing)was great and is also recommended to others, I had a pleasant stay there. So overall New Delhi wasn't for me and the 3 days there were my limit and enough to see everything in my opinion.

Varanasi

Varanasi was one of my pre-tour must sees so I was excited to visit it and to get away from Delhi. But it in equal parts fascinated, frightened and vexed me. This time the touts were even more persistent and annoying than before, they all wanted to take you on boat ride, or buy you drugs, or show you a better view or try to tell you a fact on a temple and ask for a 'donation'. Again I know it sounds crap to moan about people hassling you as hey it's India right? But when it is every few seconds it gets old very quickly. Another time at a ghat we were literally forced to move by a drug addled local who said
Boat cruise
we could not watch unless we paid him money, he got aggressive and started shouting and tried calling some others over, so we got out of there pretty sharpish. The police presence was monumental due to religious tensions and an apparent bombing in 2010. And yet still Varanasi won me over, as I said get through the crap and it is worth it.

Varanasi itself is actually a fairly hectic city like a mini Delhi and is just as dirty, smelly and chaotic. But all the action centres on the waterfront stretch along the infamous River Ganges. This area is known as the Old City and is aptly named as it is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, it is also regarded as one of Hinduism's seven holy cities. It is a network of narrow alleyways that can be confusing and maze-like and it's an effort not to trip over a cow, or worse a tout. The alleyways lead to the river bank and along a 1-2mile stretch are around 80 ghats, which are steps leading up from the water to the temples. The whole area is an amazing scene as you walk from one
Collapsing ghat
end to the other admiring the row of temples, sitting serenely atop their steps creating a unique skyline to gaze at. A steady stream of brightly clad pilgrims constantly flow in and out of the temples, chanting can be heard, incense is in the air, bells are rung and religion in on the lips. Even for an atheist like me it is easy to become captured and captivated by the atmosphere. The temples themselves have been replaced a few times but are still ancient and so interesting to explore; bedecked with shrines, carvings, inscriptions and paintings, and attended by devout and passionate worshippers giving offerings and chanting prayers, oh and head priests trying to extort more money out of you! Of course the ghats that most tourists are fascinated by are the burning ghats. Hindus believe that dying here offers moksha-liberation from the cycle of birth and death-and so being cremated here is extremely auspicious. Dead bodies are carried through the tiny alleyways on bamboo sticks and covered in cloth, they are brought to the ghat and dipped in the Ganges initially before being placed on the stacks of firewood ready to be incinerated. Obviously respect and reverence is vital
Khajuraho
so I cant show you pictures, but it is a truly mind boggling experience to round a corner and come across a ghat a few feet in front of you, where flames are leaping from piles of wood within which a body is neatly piled. They often cremate 2 or 3 at any one time so it makes for a vivid and emotional sight as families stand alongside mourning and praying. You are of course intruding on an intensely personal moment but it is right there in the open for all to see, the most intimate moment of someones life and its hard to tear your eyes away. It is easy to stay longer than you planned and watch amazed at the sight before you, although this can be delicate as once the families have departed you can actually see a slightly darker side as the workers use sticks to not so subtly 'move around' the remaining limbs left in order to ensure full cremation and prepare for the next body. Those that cannot be cremated (lepers, pregnant women etc) are simply wrapped in cloth, weighed down and dropped into the Ganges as well, bodies regularly pop up out of
Your first view, the wow moment
nowhere downstream but thankfully I didn't see any.

Walking along the stretch of ghats is also surreal and awe inspiring. I love to people watch but the 2 days here nearly gave me enough memories to store for a lifetime, I'm not sure sitting in a cafe window and watching Cardiff people go by carrying their Tesco shopping or boutique handbags will ever be as interesting again. You come across all kinds of things;pilgrims washing away a lifetime of sins, locals bathing and washing clothes, men shaving, children swimming and playing, a herd of buffaloes taking a dip, dogs fighting, monkeys swinging from trees, cows sleeping, people doing yoga, touts asking for boats or drugs, an animal carcass floating downstream being pecked by birds, bodies being prepared for dipping and of course cremations. And while you walk, the temples throng on one side and the water flows by on the other, life and death intertwined together, and the daily habits of people go on in a cacophony of noise, smells and sights. The Ganges is these people's ways of life and the source of everything for them, but to see them bathe and play in it alongside the buffalo
I was there!
and carcasses makes for a stomach clenching time.

Then occurred my most intimidating and frantic visit I have ever encountered. Varanasi also has a golden temple named Vishwanath, and is the most famous in the city, pilgrims travel the length of the country to make an offering here. The area is full of heavily armed soldiers due to security issues and communal tensions, we had to take our passports and declare them and sign in, some cash to give the priests and we were also told non stop about watching our pockets. We were also told to state we were Hindu if anybody asked and to expect chaos. Thoroughly daunted already we (myself and an Aussie from hotel) went ahead. The atmosphere was electric, and I mean in the life threatening sense. The idea was fairly simple, within the complex was a shrine in the middle, where pilgrims form a queue to make their offering of milk and flower by throwing it in a well, thus receiving a blessing which would sort them for life. However this led to the most passionate, ferverent, intense and downright scary scrum I have ever witnessed. The pilgrims were so intent on making
Taj at sunset
their offering that it was carnage, it was like a football riot only 100 times worse. Nothing scares me more than absolute religious ferverence, the kind which leads to suicide bombers etc and those that will do anything for what they believe, even it means laying down their lives. The pushing, shoving, shouting, screaming, crying and aggression that followed was surreally intense, and when done in a foreign tongue it is infinitely worse. And for an added touch the Police were in there manhandling anyone within grasp. As we were with a hotel guide we were introduced to a priest who said he could get us in, but on seeing the hordes I didn't want any part of it, he said it would be fine and grabbed us by the arm and led us to the exit of the shrine. So we had to try and fight-and I mean elbows knees and any other extremity- against all those who had just made their offerings and were trying to force their way out,so we could get in and do ours. Reaching the centre offered no respite, it was even more hysteria and pandemonium and a complete claustrophobic feeling ensued. Mine must

have been the quickest offering to Shiva ever known as I chucked it and bolted. It took a long time afterwards to calm down and return to normal, it was only when back at the hotel I felt vaguely normal. Religious people are intense, I think I'll stick to Connect 4.
During my time there I also took a Ganges boat ride which was interesting as it gave the chance to see Varanasi from a different perspective, and I also watched the evening Ganga aarti ceremony to the river which included puja, fire and dance. Oh and I also got my first case of Delhi/Varanasi belly since I arrived, which got me acquainted with my toilet a lot more frequently than I would have liked. Thankfully some Imodium and tablets from the local pharmacy sorted me out because for a while I resembled the Ganges myself. Alka hotel is recommended for the amazing views from the balcony and decent price, plus a communal area to meet loads of people, I think this as much as anything helped me get over my initial culture shock of India, other peoples company is a wonderful thing!

Khajuraho

Everybody knows that spiritual
Main entrance
stuff leads to sex(just ask your local priest, only don't take your young son along)so off I tottered to Khajuraho for a bit of a perve. Khajuraho has three groups of temples listed on the World Heritage 'you can't knock these down' list, which is wise as otherwise who knows what mess they'd be in by now. The temples are famous for being extremely erotic and are covered in carvings of naked women, nymphs, people going at it while others watch, threesomes, foursomes and full scale mass orgies, there were gymnastic moves of Olympic quality including one called 'the handstand' (it's easy,ask your priest whilst there) and beastiality. You haven't quite spent a proper Sunday afternoon in India until you have walked around a temple desperately trying to find the picture of 2guys shagging a horse. When the carvings aren't showing women or sex they are showing battles, so it seems that in AD 1000 people were either inventing mad new sexual positions or starting wars, beats watching Songs of Praise I guess. I spent the morning there with 2 English guys and it was a bit like that time when you are kids and discover a porn mag in
Corner view
the bushes and invite everyone around to stare, as we kept calling each other to point at various impossibly positioned groups and proceeded to snigger. However, the erotic content should not take away from the absolute stunning pieces of work that they actually are. The temples themselves were striking from afar and up close you could really appreciate the intricate work that must have gone into each carving. One temple has 872 statues alone, each one 1metre high, and the definition and detail in each statue was staggering. After a certain height the posing and cartwheeling women gave way to roof spires, which make up a mountain like rooftop scene. If more buildings were like this, intricately made and jaw droppingly stunning, but with enough filth to make you cross your legs,then I could really become a fan of architecture. The touts here were even pushier than in other places and there was nothing else to do there, but it was an interesting visit and a nice alternative to the pollution filled cities as it was very green and lush surroundings.

Agra

Sadly after that I had to return back to reality and face the jam packed area
View from my hotel rooftop
of Agra, it is the home of the Taj Mahal and so it is another version of Delhi and Varanasi but I shall save the moans this time. The amazement of seeing THE Taj Mahal just overrides the people, the mess, the power cuts etc etc and reminds you why you came to India in the first place. It was quite simply the best man-made thing I have ever seen, the greatest building in the world maybe, and there wasn't even a guy doing a sheep on it or anything. It is the most visited site in India and it is easy to see why, it was everything I had always imagined it to be and more. It was even slightly surreal, a little like when I saw New York or LA, there are certain places so iconic and shown so often that you imagine seeing one day,and then you are actually there in the flesh, it's a great feeling of awe and wonderment. The taj was finally finished in 1653 and built by a shah for his dead wife. He was later imprisoned when overthrown by his son and could only gaze at it through his prison window, but
Fatephur Sikri
I think the view would almost compensate for being locked up. It is just beautifully designed, it sits on a raised platform meaning you can view it from afar and backs wondrously against the sky, although sadly it was more cloudy than clear blue sky when I was there. This also ruined my 5am visit to the roof to watch the sunrise! I entered at 6:30 and there were some but very few people there which made it even more atmospheric and special, I am glad I defied my lazy nature and got up early for this because it really filled up as I left at 9. The Taj is made from white marble which still gleams and looks as it did when built I imagine, it has 4 identical sides which far from being boring made it better somehow, especially for an OCD freak like me loving symmetry. The marble has high arches, inlaid with semi precious stones, flowers and also calligraphy quoting scripture from the Quran. These get larger as they get higher giving the impression of uniform size, very clever. Inside there are the cenotaphs of the Shah and his wife, again surrounded by beautiful marble screens

and it is all topped by the wonderful dome. The 4 minarets tower above and a huge gateway leads into it giving you that mouth opening 'wow'moment when you first see it. It also sits amid beautiful gardens, flowing fountains and water in front which allows you to see the Taj in perfect reflection and is also built on the bend of a serene river. To top it off I had a hotel which had a rooftop restaurant and it looked right at the Taj from nearby so I spent most of that evening gazing in wonder while drinking Indian beer and eating good food with people during the sunset. It even looked great in silhouette I can tell you. Hassle, aggravation, pain, all forgotten while staring at this monument to mans achievements, I'm not sure we will ever rival mother nature but the Taj has a damn good go.

For the remainder do the day I visited a place called Fatehpur Sikri, a stunning fortified city about 40km away. It was a capital for a while back in the late 1500s and was great to imagine this city, the people and their culture, with the Taj up the
Good eating, a thali
road, both in their pomp back in those days. The city contained a hugely impressive mosque and a palace for each of the Shah's(not the Taj shah) three wives. The mosques entrance gate is 54metres high alone, and inside are various tombs including one made of similar marble to the Taj. This Shah had a Christian, Muslim and Hindu wife, so he was a player but an all encompassing one. He built a palace for each wife incorporating their religions so it is a great blend of all cultures, along with ornamental pools, and pavilions etc. I found it interesting and complemented the Taj visit very well so was worth the visit.

And so that's the first section done, sorry if it went on a while but I covered a fair bit and had to put about 2000 words of moaning and depression in there! I have since found India a little easier to cope with since those first early mind frazzling days in Delhi, but I don't think even my best of moods would have liked that place. I have also met a lot more people since leaving Delhi so I hope this continues. This blog covers the
More filth
area known as the Golden Triangle and is the main touristy section, so perhaps it is only natural that I found it so manic and tout/scam heavy and maybe I should have left it until the end. That said next up I have Rajasthan, a region of desert and forts, camel treks and oasis, with a bit of the famous Golden Temple in Amritsar thrown in, so I look forward to that, and after that it is north into the mountains for a bit of Dalai Lama, stunning views and maybe a trek. I have also heard that the people are infinitely nicer as soon as you leave the Triangle and head away. Lord Ganesh I hope so! Catch you then people.

Taj Mahal from my hotel roof
I arrived in Delhi on Sunday in the early afternoon. Since I needed to catch an early train on Monday morning, I decided to try and dash over for a quick visit to the main monument in Delhi, the Red Fort, since I would only have time to do one visit. Outside the railway station there is a tourist office hotel booking agency so I went there first. It was useful that I did because when I mentioned that I wanted to stay near the station because I had to catch a train the next morning, the guy asked to look at my train ticket. He noticed, which I had missed, that my train was actually leaving from Hazmat Nizzamudin, a station in the suburbs of Delhi rather then the central New Delhi station that I had arrived at. Anyway, he sorted out a hotel and a cycle rickshaw to take me there. I had a ride in one of those last year in Phnom Penh but this was my first one India. The guy was really old and seemed to be struggling and it was then I noticed that the bike had no gears which I thought rather unhelpful in
The Taj Mahal
that kind of job.

After checking in at the hotel I just dumped my stuff and went straight back out and found a tuk tuk to take me to the Red Fort. It was just as well that I went at once as it closed at 6:30pm that day. I had chance to walk round the whole thing rather quickly and took a few photos but didn't really get chance to take it in properly. It is a very large site with a number of key buildings quite some distance from each other. This makes it difficult to take one photo that really does it justice. Although it is a pretty important monument, I did think that it looked quite shabby in places but the architecture and the carvings were impressive.

Back to my hotel then for a much needed shower, then spent an hour in an internet cafe before going to eat - had an excellent chicken curry in a really small local food shop (I couldn't really call it a restaurant!). I went to bed early because I thought I needed an early start as this other station was quite a way off. I was up
Agra Fort
at 7am on the Monday, packed and set off to find a tuk tuk to take me to the suburban station. The train was due to leave at 9:20am but I got there at about 7:45 - a bit over cautious in retrospect. The train was also almost an hour late in leaving so I had a long wait on the platform where I had some breakfast (vegetable samosas!) and got chatting to some Indian guys, one of whom turned out to be an IT teacher.

The train duly arrived in Agra one hour late but this time I still had the whole afternoon so there was no rush. Before leaving the station I decided to reserve a seat on the last remaining train that I planned to get which wasn't yet booked. Agra train reservations office was much more civilised than the one I had to use in Amritsar. This time there was no pushing and shoving, and there was a separate queue for foreigh tourists, disabled people, the elderly and freedom fighters! It only took about 15 minutes to get to my turn at the counter. With that sorted, I went outside and got a tuk tuk to one of the hotels recommended in the Lonely Planet India guide - The Shanti Lodge. This hotel has a rooftop restaurant with a superb view of the Taj Mahal. I went up there first to take a couple of photos but it then started raining and poured down heavily for the next hour or so, so I went and had a shower till it abated.

I decided to do the proper tours inside the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort tomorrow, so this afternoon I just walked around all 3 sides of the Taj Mahal (it backs on to the river but you aren't allowed to walk along that side), down to the river Yamuna, and took quite a few photos of the outside and the 3 entrances.

On Tuesday morning I had breakfast on the roof garden of the hotel with the Taj Mahal in the background. It was fortunate that I had taken a photo of this view yesterday as this morning it was very hazy and the Taj was almost lost in the mist. There are 3 entrances - West, South and East, and then the north side backs onto the river. the cost of entry is 750 rupees, just under 10 pounds sterling, but it was worth every panny. The Taj Mahal is considered to be the most beautiful building in the world and I for one could not disagree. The main mausoleum is completely constructed from white marble inlaid with various other colours of marble and semi-precious stones to make some wonderful designs. In frot of the actual mausoleum there is a large park and this park is surrounded by a high red sandstone wall and with some pretty impressive gateways at the three entrances.

After about 3 hours wondering this site, I then walked the short distance to Agra Fort, another red sandstone building with very high walls. The guy who had the Taj Mahal built, Shah Jahan, was overthrown by his son a few years later and imprisoned in this fort in a white marble octagonal tower where he could gaze on his construction.

First breakdown
A car picked us up from our hotel at 6am and we set off for Agra! We thought it'd take between 3-4 hours depending on traffic... but that was before the flat tyre. So we were stuck at the side of the road for a good half an hour at least. Eventually we set off and the traffic was already starting to build up. We weren't bothered about stopping for breakfast on the way but our driver wanted to stop anyway. It was pretty obvious that he got commission for taking us to this well over priced food court/emporium, and i think he actually got a free meal out of it as well!

After a 5 hour drive we finally reached Agra. It was utter chaos - everywhere. The streets were packed with people walking or selling things, Rickshaws, motorbikes, buses, taxi's - the lot! The driver parked up and insisted that we took a tour guide (who conveniently turned up as soon as we were parked) which we refused. We walked up to the West entry gate to the Taj Mahal and took a long walk past some Camels which were being used as transport to the ticket office
First view of the Taj
- they were in a sorry state, poor things. We paid for our tickets (which were around 8 Pounds each for a foreigner, but 60p for an Indian) and went through security. Like in most tourist places there were two queues, one for men the other for women. Despite walking through the correct queue, the security guard gave Graeme a strange look and shouted ""WOMAN??"" and pointed him over to the womens queue. After reassuring him that he was in fact a male the security guard shouted to the rest of the guards, and they all laughed. Graeme's face throughout the whole thing was hilarious.

Once we walked through the main entrance we saw the Taj from a distance at first through an arch shaped gate. We were worried that the Taj might have been over hyped and so might be disappointing. But it looked amazing. We had a few photos taken in front of it and suprisingly got to the front of a pretty small queue for the Diana seat and had a photo taken there - despite Graeme's reluctance to strike the Diana pose!

We walked around gardens and the inside of the building, which didn't
Taj Mahal
take long. I think we spent just over an hour there all in all. THis time also included at least 5 whole families asking for ""One snap, please!"". One photo turned into 10 per family. But it was all good fun.

After leaving the grounds we headed back to our car, it had just started to spit with rain as we were walking towards the car and as soon as we got in the car the heavy rain started. It was coming down hard so we decided not to visit Agra Fort as planned as it's all outdoors. The driver tried and tried to persuade us to ""take a look at my friend's shop until the rain stops"", we politely declined, again and again. Instead we asked him to take us to see the mini Taj Mahal only around 3km away. The guy blatantly didn't know what we were talking about as he took us to what looked like another shop, pointed at it and said ""Look, the mini Taj!"". After a while of explaining what we wanted, he found the place and even though it was still raining a little bit we enjoyed walking around.

After getting
Taj Mahal
back to the car, we headed back to Delhi. Another tyre had a puncture. So after another long wait at the side of the road we were finally on our way. We stopped for food at one of our driver's friend's 'restaurants' (shack on the side of the motorway). By the time we made it through the evening traffic in Delhi it had been a 6 hour journey. We were really tired and hungry so once we were back in Delhi we went for our first Mcdonald's in India. It was amazing. We tried the Maharaja burger which is like a Big Mac but with chicken.

We were so past full it was unbelievable. We decided to walk it off and take a nice relaxing walk back to our hotel. But we got a bit lost. So we took a cycle Rickshaw back.

We slept like babies that night!

The amazing Taj Mahal
Note Lou's head scarf, and Michael jackson1
We rose early at 6.30am with great excitement because of our anticipated vist to the Taj Mahal. Our tour guide for the day was a "" Michael Jackson"" look a lke who talked a lot! The ""Taj is truely amazing, a beautiful symmetrical architectural feat with intricate detail throughout. the Taj was built buy the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial for his 3rd wife Mumtaz Mahal who died giving birth to their 14th child. The building was started in 1631 and said to be conpleted over 8 years and all built by hand. Diary Entry;""It is a truely amazing building and I wish we had more time to just sit and absorb the beauty and observe the changing colours - "" A teardrop on the cheek of eternity""( Rabindranath Tagore). Even after an early start the weather was extremely hot so we decided to continue on our tour of Agra visiting the Agra fort, another massive structure. This fort was where Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his son for the last years of his life. Here he could gaze across to the Taj Mahal to the burial palce of his wife. So romantic! We went back to the motel
The Taj
for breakfast and did a little more touring of forts and Temples in Agra before we continued our journey onto Jaipur. Our driver for the Golden Triangle tour was a beautiful Hindu man named Sanjeev. He was quietly spoken but looked after us very well, making sure all our stops had Western toilets and reasonable food. The road houses on our travels always served curries, which Marco saddled up to every lunch stop. Marco certainly earns the ""Iron guts"" award for the trip although one stop he ventured to the toilet , returning to the table stated "" Straight in Straight out""! The kids travelled well given the hot conditions, the ordinary roads and the long distances that we travelled. Nikki took advantage of the back seat of the bus which we had to tour in all by ourselves, and couldn't help but stretch out. I was a bit nervous with this as the Hindi people believe that the feet are ""dirty"" , the children are never allowed to sit on the floor in schools. So I thought this Nikki's lounging on the back seat may be frowned upon by Sanjeev. He never commented , and in fact at one
The family at the Taj
stop he bought a cushion for Nikki especially so that ""she could sleep""! While touring fron Agra to Jaipur we travelled through farming areas and lots of towns seeing cows, pigs, camels, dogs, over loaded vechiles, street stalls etc.etc. On one rare occasion we were travelling on a two lane highway , finally getting up a little speed when out of nowhere appeared a cow that somehow Sanjeev miraculously avoided to hit. We all were jolted and frightened, Sanjeev blessed himself and said a little prayer! We finally arrived at Jaipur, ""The Pink city"", and stayed in a great motel once again with a pool ( No bats or monkeys!)

Today we said Goodbye to Kezia, who is meeting friends in Mumbai and continueing on with her travelling adventures. We later said Goodbye to Varanasi, although I was sick for the majority of my stay here and it was extremely hot, I loved the experience in this Holy City. If we wanted to experience something different than this place was it, so very interesting. The Varanasi Airport was a very nice modern Airport and we departed from here and flew to Delhi. We were picked up at the Delhi Airport and transported to ""The Connaught"" hotel in New Delhi.

Varansi
Doing the washing on the ganges
We started this day with a Dawn cruise down the Ganges. It is really hard to describe what this experience is like as Varanasi is a spritual place with lots of ritual and worshipping happening everywhere. You float down the Ganges at dawn and you see people worshipping, ritual cremations at the burning Ghat, people and cows bathing and others washing their clothes on the rocks. During the day we took another boat ride dow the Ganges to Ramnagar Fort. Diary Entry ; "" This was a museum from years ago, some B.C stuff, lots of guns and carriages. We had annoying boys following us, tyring to show us around. We got yelled at by a Holy man for attempting to go into a temple and there were bats. it was extremely hot and I did not like this adventure at all!"" We took an evening Ganges ride where the boat driver rowed us right up to the edge of the Burning Ghat. A holy man hopped on the boat and proceeded to tell us all about the cremations that occur on the ghat. Diary entry; "" It is the belief that once the ""Hindi"" person's body is burnt there soul
The beautiful Ganges
is released and goes directly to heaven. this is a joyous occasion and no-one is permitted to cry. There a 5 exceptions, who are not allowed to be burnt; 1. Infants (Under 10) 2.Pregnant Women 3.A Hindi who has been bitten by a Cobra snake, 4. Anyone inflicted with Small pox 5. Anyone with leprosy. These exceptions are tied to a stone and thrown in the middle of the ganges."" the ritual when someone dies is that they are wrapped in colourful material and tied to Bamboo ladders, which you sometimes see being transported around the streets in Varanasi. The corpse is tipped into the Ganges for its final wash, dried out and then burnt. After the Holyman's informative chat he then hit us with how they need funds to run Hospice building where poor people come to die next to the holy ghat. Lou offered some Rupees which he wasn't happy with so we coughed up some more money because we weren't too sure what would happen if we didin't. The Holyman then placed the red dot on our foreheads and gave us a lovely blessing before jumping off the boat with a pocket full of our money!!! On
Varanasi University
our journey home I had an interesting conversation with the boat driver about his children who were similar ages to marco and Nikki. Iasked him what he thought his children would do after they left school. He said that he hoped he could save enough money to buy them a shop! I said will they not go to University. He replied that was ""too much money"" ! There are thousands and thousands of these tiny shops in the streets of Varanasi and that was his ambition for his children, so different from our world!

Varanasi
Man weaving Silk
This day was a physical meltdown for me, I was crook! Woozy and Ill ! However rallied to join the family on a guided tour of Varanasi. Varanasi has some pretty impressive Temples and an enormous University - the biggest in India. We visited a place where silk was spun and woven, beautiful craftmenship! You are taken to these places where you are shown how the craft is made, usually air conditioned and they prime you with cool drinks. The kids always encouraged the tour guides to go to these places for the refreshments! We made purchases at this place, Table centres, Lou 2 silk shirts -customed made, and me a Doona Set. I actually vomitted in a Western toilet at this place so cannot be held reponsible for my choice of doona cover, and the bloody thing slips off the bed all the time! At this point of time we deemed it necessary to take a little time off touring so on Kezia's advice we visited the Syria Hotel which had a pool that you could use and cool drinks. After Refreshments and dinner we made our way back to the B&B in a Tuk tuk. After a few Kingfishers
Varanasi
An impressive statue that I have forgotten what it was called!
Lou was very persistent with his questioning of the poor non English speaking Tuk tuk driver on "" how many Tuk tuk's are there in Varansi?"" . The poor man just did the old Indian head shake and concentrated on weaving the Tuk Tuk home between other Vechiles, people and cows.

Patna
Well the train Station a Patna was on par with New Jalpaiguri with respect to the dirtiness, the crowds , and the sleeping bodies everywhere! Our tired, dirty dismayed bodies made their way through the people to outside the Patna station with the thought of finding a jeep to drive us to Varanasi. One guy approached us who had reasonable English and we negotiated with him to organise this jeep. On discovering that we were Australian he assured us of his good friendship with Shane Warne. He allocated us a young driver who spoke no English and not a lot of idea of how to get to Varanasi, but with the deal of 5000 rupees we were set to go, or so we thought. The young driver did look a little dirty, however we loaded up with 2000 upfont payment and headed straight to a petrol staion to fuel up. The overnight train travellers were in need of a toilet, so after getting the very casual petrol attendant to open the petrol station we hit the squat toilets ! The things you do on a needs basis ! Then we were treated to a little tour through inner Patna and we
Patna
stopped at a house. Out jumped the driver , who went into the house while we bemused waited in the Jeep. Some time later our driver returns, showered and with another young guy who sat in the back of the jeep and off we went.The drive was interesting as we drove through a lot of farming area and villages. Poverty was very evident and the lack of infrastructure in the organisatiion of water and the roads was evident. We travelled over a busy bridge, at one stage I was looking to the right admiring the river we were crossing, then I looked out my window on the left and there was a cow!!!! We travelled on and came across a traffic jam in the middle of a town. We sat in the jeep and waited, it was very hot and we were receiving plenty of interest from the locals who were amused at seeing a jeep full of a white family. Diary Entry ; ""Kez had her melting moment and decided to go and see what was going on! The seasoned traveller stormed out of the car and up the road to find out what the hold up was"". I
The White people in a roadblock!
was drawing pictures trying to work out something with our drivers . When Kezia returned she was followed by a trail of people and the car was suddenly surrounded by Indians.it appears that there was bamboo across the road put there as a protest to the lack of water to the region. Lou was very toey by this stage, I never felt threatened as our drivers were looking out for us, there were some people keeping others back from the jeep and stopping photos being taken of us. Then those organising the protest thought it best to clear a path for us and the ""white family"" were let go through the roadblock . What an Experience! We journeyed on with one more stop before we reached Varanasi. This was a melting point for me! Diary entry; "" No western toilet, No cold drinking water, a stop in the middle of nowhere where they were cooking curries! The driver and I got marco and I some water and it was disgusting! Not impressed! After lots of requests for directions our young drivers eventually delivered us to Varanasi to the ""Kedareswar Bed and Breakfast"" on the Chowki Ghat which was to be our home/refuge for the next 3 days.

Famous???
Geo: 25.282, 82.9563

I shall start this little story before our arrival in actual Varanasi, as it was quite an adventure in itself.... it had been a usual truck driving day, with singing, dancing in the isle, reading and ipodding, stopping off for cold drinks where we could find them as the hot water tank was beginning to become tea temperature again! As the sun began to dip in the sky, we pulled off the side of the road for out bush camp that night.... little did we know it would poss beat the rubbish dump in Turkey to the title of THE worst!

As we pulled off the side of the road, we began to attract followers. Adam had a tyre to change, and cook group had tea to prepare.... after the space of 10 mins, we were surrounded by over 100, poss 200 people. Lorries were stopping on the side of the road to stare and locals from all the surrounding villages came for a gawp too! Some of us sat around one side to guard the tool locker for Adam, whilst others were cook group side, trying to keep back the advancing crowds. By the time we were
the crowds around the truck
eating, it had become dark and stones we thrown at the girls. We asked them to stop, and it did for a while, but then they were bored again as we, the performing monkeys were not doing as they wanted. After half an hour of abuse, the crew decided it was time to move, as it would not be safe to sleep in tents and the truck was an easy target too!

We drove through the dark (I don't envy Adam driving those roads in the pitch black!) until we arrived at the hotel we were supposed to arrive at the following day! By this time it was 11pm and we were all very ready for bed. We set the tents up in the grounds of the hotel, which seemed pretty posh to have us lot on their lawn.... one guest commented that it looked like a refugee camp! Charming! That night I have never sweated so much in my life.... it was truly disgusting in the morning. So after breakfast our immediate port of call was the hotel swimming pool, which we resided in until middayish, looking like prunes as we emerged! Then food time in the hotel
goat on a wall
restaurant (dragged out for a few hours as there was ac and a decent place to play cards in) having a meat platter, consisting of lamb, chicken and fish cooked in a variety of Indian spices.... delicious (making me hungry just thinking about it!). Then back to the pool and then back to the bar! A truly lazy day.... wonderful.... well I say lazy.... I did swim 75 lengths....

The only thing I wanted to do whilst here, was go down to the River Ganges at sunrise, to see the Ghats and set a candle afloat for Nan. The group booked through the hotel to go down, which was all a bit of a shambles with drivers etc., but eventually we made it, a little later than planned, but as it was an overcast day, I guess it didn't make all that much difference! The candles were beautiful in their petal laden baskets, and the atmosphere on the river bank is indescribable. People washing their clothes, animals drinking, people with their morning cleansing rituals, children swimming with inners of tyres as their rubber rings and bodies of humans and animals bobbing around them! We saw the ghat where cremations
the ganges
occur constantly and areas where the bodies of babies, pregnant women, holy people and lepers were cast into the river rapped in shrouds as they were not allowed to be burnt. It truly was a remarkable experience; I just wish the sky had been clearer than it was.

All in all it was an experience, but to be truthfully honest, I am ready to get the hell out of India!

OMG
Geo: 26.9847, 78.1019

The drive
through Agra to our hotel was not all that inspiring, considering it was the
city of one of the most, if not the most famous building in the world. The
street sewers were overflowing; the smell was and still is indescribable, as whiffs
of decaying rubbish and poop (politest way of putting it!) filtered through the
windows and the gag reflex of all the passengers was triggered. The road of our
hotel, is definitely not designed for larger vehicles either, as we drove down
the road we managed to block it in both directions, with people stopping and
staring/ waving/ begging… the horns were unreal… we were not looking forward to
the hotel!

Fortunately,
this place is a little enclave, with a courtyard in the middle, sheltered from
the noises and the majority of the smells outside. Our little piece of peace!!The Taj
Mahal was the only thing really on the agenda for here, as there are plenty of
bazaars and forts in the town, however I am all shopped and buildinged out for
the time being! We left the hotel at 5.30 to arrive at the site for opening and
with the morning sun still catching the pinnacles. At a cost of 750 IRs to go
in, to us it seemed extortionate… the
The Main Gateway
majority of things being 100IRs at most to
gain entry, but in reality, this is only about £10, so we really shouldn't complain,
especially after what we charge foreigners to see the sights of London. As we
entered the west gate, there was a slight apprehension of seeing ‘THE' Taj
Mahal…. Such pressure to take the perfect photo, that would go down in history
and be shown to your grandkids! As you round the corner to the main gateway
into the grounds, you see it, framed by the gate itself, standing elegantly against
the azure sky. It really is a breath taking sight. The girls and I were dressed in
our Indian suits so to attempt to look the part… decided against the sari due
to the heat!

To be honest
for the rest I will let the photos tell the story. It is truly hard to describe
the pure size of the thing. Simply and beautifully carved and embellished. A
true wonder of the world… but give me the mountains any day!

Varanasi-Ghat
10 Juin 2012, Varanasi

Varanasi est de loin la place la plus spéciale que j’ai visité en Inde. Un autre monde. Un monde qui semble encore appartenir au moyen-âge, ou plutôt un monde qui semble suspendu dans le temps.



Un monde où les indiens vont pour mourir ou pour dire adieu à un proche. Le Gange est un fleuve sacré pour les Hindous, et y mourir met fin à leur cycle de réincarnation pour enfin aller au paradis. Pour ce faire, ils brûlent les corps sur le bord du Gange, et après 3heures, ils jettent ce qui reste des ossements dans le fleuve. Dépendamment de leurs moyens financiers, ils choisissent de brûler sur des essences de bois différentes, ou par le gaz pour les moins fortunés. Les feux sont installés sur le bord du fleuve, au même Ghat (une portion de la rive du Gange, où des marches descendent dans le fleuve). Il y a plusieurs crémations en même temps, du matin au soir. Le corps, enveloppé dans un tissu orange et décoré de fleurs, est déposé sur une planche de bois, que porte un cortège dans les ruelles de la ville jusqu’au Ghat. Tout le monde
Varanasi
peut assister à la cérémonie, de loin, mais aucune photo n’est permise.



Certaines personnes sont aussi jetées directement dans le fleuve sacré sans purification par le feu, tel que les hommes religieux, les enfants de moins de 10ans, les femmes enceintes et les gens qui ont été mordus par un cobra. Donc, il se peut que l’on voie un corps flotté sur l’eau, comme lors de notre promenade en bateau sur le Gange. Un corps tout gonflé et bleui par l’eau était pris dans les cordages d’un bateau accosté. Sans faire exprès, il s’est même retrouvé sur une de mes photos, avant que je ne le voie!



Le Gange ne sert pas qu’à mourir. Au contraire, il est plein de vie! Des masses de monde y vont chaque matin pour prier, se laver, laver son linge (non, je n’ai pas fait faire de lavage ici!), se baigner, se purifier, baigner ses vaches, etc. Tout ça à côté des égouts qui s’y versent et des corps qui flottent. Beurk!



Sinon, juste se promener dans les ruelles de Varanasi est une expérience en soi. C’est un véritable labyrinthe de ruelles pas plus large
Varanasi-Gange à 5h30am
que deux mètres, où se trouvent les GuestHouse et les restaurants, les temples et les petits magasins. Et les vaches! On a aussi visité une fabrique de soie, la spécialité de la région. C’était très intéressant! On a appris comment faire la différence entre la soie, le coton et le polyester : lorsqu’il brûle, la soie sent et a la texture du cheveu brûlé, le coton celle du papier et le polyester celle du plastique. Le propriétaire (et vendeur, évidemment...) nous a instruit pour éviter de se faire arnaquer lors de nos achats (et pour qu'on achète ensuite dans son commerce, évidemment...). Mais je me vois mal brûler le foulard d’un marchand sous prétexte que je ne lui fais pas confiance!



Ensuite on est retourné à Delhi, pour finaliser quelques achats et quitter l’Inde! En résumé, je dirais que l’Inde est indéniablement un superbe pays à visiter, où la culture est unique en son genre et bien conservée. Et un pays très diversifié; on ne s’ennuie jamais! Sinon, pourquoi y voyager 3 mois ?! C’est non seulement l’image de la carte postale et l’idée que l’on se fait de l’Inde (turbans, saris, palais, temples et pousse-pousse), mais
Varanasi
avec la participation de tous les autres sens, souvent aux extrêmes. Chants de temples ou de klaxons, odeurs de fruits ou de pipi, goût parfumé ou trop épicé, vue colorée ou bétonnée.

Et les indiens…. Il y a une seule chose que je changerais dans ce pays : les indiens! Même si on doit accepter leurs manières bien différentes des nôtres, il n’empêche que ça prend une bonne dose de patience et un brin d’humour pour les endurer. Et une bonne dose de débrouillardise et d'autonomie pour arriver à nos fins, parce que l'Inde, c'est broche-à-foin. Et peu serviable, à moins de payer! D'ailleurs, il faut aussi être indépendant et malheureusement suspicieux, sinon on se fait constamment avoir... Mais bon. Ça fait partit du contrat!



Namasté!

TajMahal
Its was 5 in the summer morning when my alarm start beeping to wake me up, so i should'nt be late to catch my train from delhi station for agra. Agra 200 km far from south east delhi located on the banks of river Yamuna. Agra is famous for Tajmahal and for its famous sweet "" agra ka petha"" (aah it fill water in my mouth). Well it is a war to locate your train and then board in.... after locating platform of my train, i heard annoucement that train is on time, that relives me more... finally, train came and i got my seat. the train took 3.30 hr to reach agra. the train stoped at Mathura station and i bought some famous ""mathura ka peeda"" to complete my breakfast. Like, in delhi for whole delhi tour you can book Ho ho, same here in agra u can get Auto ho ho, where u can bargain from 400 to 200 rs for agra tour or maybe less if u are better in bargaining. so i managed an auto in 200 rs to cover all major destination spots in agra. Raju (auto driver) told us the places he was going to cover were Taj mahal, red fort, Balaji temple and market. Raju drived auto in rajnikant style and too me ""Taj mahal"" in just 20 min. The outside market of tajmahal remind old delhi market. Crowdy and busy roads, filled with smell of different foods. After putting my bagpack in the clock room and paying entry fee i entered. the breathtaking view of Tajmahal building made up of white stone (Sangmarmar). The inside picture was different from outside clean, green and the people trying to make it clean by putting waste in wastebin. The place was crowded like some fest. Everyone taking pictures in different poses, so i tryed too but lots of unwanted peoples comes in my picture. After spending 2 hrs exploring and learning aout tajmahal. i headed toward my second destination ""red fort"". it simillar to that in Delhi red fort, built with red stone, crowded. From the attire of red fort u can see Tajmahal. this is the place where sahajahn stands and keep watch on Tajmahal. Well it was 12 in the noon and temperatuer was rising 38 C. In the evening at 6 raju dropped me at the bus stand and board on bus to delhi..

Jumping pic, had to be done
We left bustling New Delhi on our second full day in India. We were excited to leave the busy capital of India and head to the home of the Taj Mahal, Agra. This marks our first trip on an Indian train. The train station was a mere 5 minute walk from our hostel, so we packed up our bags and set off for a day of travel. The train station was easy to navigate and before we knew it we were sitting in our cabin of the train at platform 3. We had a sleeper cabin with fan no A/C. The train itself was not fancy or overly comfortable but we had a place to sit and a window to enjoy the views that passed by. It seemed like we were the only foreign travelers that day and it's strange coming from tourist filled Southeast Asia to this, but it's probably the heat that's keeping travelers away.



As we sat waiting for our train to set of on the 3 1/2 hour journey to Agra we enjoyed watching the hustle and bustle of the train station from our safe quarters. On the tracks besides us were heaps of
a train passing by :)
trash and even human feces. People just dropped their trash right on the tracks rather than placing it in the bins on the platforms. There are water fountains placed on the platforms and we watched as locals refilled their plastic bottles. I wondered how safe the water is to drink or if they have become immune to the bacteria that could still reside in that water that would send us to the toilet for hours. We have learned to crush our water bottles so that they won't be picked up, refilled and resold as ""clean"" water. If we were taught that refilling bottles of water is bad for us then why is it that they can use these fountains? I'll have to do some research on that later.



My favorite part of traveling in a new country is the journey between destinations. From point A to point B, you get a seconds glimpse of the untouched (by tourism) side of the country. I love every second of peering out the window watching life go by. India is a whole new place that is so very different from anywhere else I have been. The stretch from New Delhi
Agra Fort
to Agra is very dry and dusty with villages that are filled with people, cows, and trash. I've never seen such poverty in my life, countries that come close (in my experiences) are Cambodia and Laos. In the glimpses I had of the villages, houses were made of mud, clay, or cement, dirt filled the towns every crevasse, cows picked at the trash looking for food, cow patties sat in the sun drying, children played out in the sun, women worked the fields, and men sat under trees enjoying each other's company. Oh! And it's not uncommon here to see people taking a dump on the side of the road. Never in a million years did I think I'd ever see someone doing such a thing, but here in India it's not good to have expectations. Around every corner there is something that will completely blow the mind away and you catch yourself thinking, ""wow."" I'm enjoying every second of it.



My favorite part of India is the vibrant use of colors. There are beautiful, vibrant colored sarees on most of the women, buildings are aged and cracked but the colors still shine out and vary building
a glimpse in the daily life
to building, bright colored rickshaws fill the streets, and trash even brings a rainbow of colors to the scenery. Viewing India as a passenger is an overload to the senses, smells, sight, sounds, taste, and touch are all being put to new tiers. India is overwhelming to the senses, there is a lot to take in and process. India keeps you on your toes, there is never a dull moment.



When we arrived Agra, we haggled with a driver and he fit us and our three massive bags into his rickshaw, a feat I never imagined possible. He zipped in and out of the traffic of Agra, by passing bicycles and cows and avoiding the bigger and faster cars along the way. We arrived safely to our hostel, Friends Paying Guesthouse, where a 15 year old boy took care of checking us in and taking our dinner order. We settled into our rooms, which were fairly simple and slightly disgusting. My bathroom had no working light, grim and dirt in each corner, and a toilet that did not flush. We didn't complain (much) because for $4.50 a night we had a place to lay our heads down
Chinni Ka Rauza
and sleep. Other than the room conditions, this hostel is great. It's a 10 minute walk to the Taj Mahal, it's family owned and run, and the food is absolutely amazing. Our total bill for 2 nights stay, 3 meals, and countless bottles of water came to a little less than $20 usd each! You just can't beat that.



That first day we didn't do much but we did take a stroll down to the Taj Mahal gate before we retired to the guesthouse for the rest of the evening. We could only see the very top of the Taj but nothing more than that. There are plenty of horse drawn carriages that try to whisk you away to one of the world's most romantic structures, but we shooed them away. They always exclaimed that it was such a far walk but when really it's about 1 km. We found out upon arriving to Agra, that the Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays, so we spent our first full day (Friday) exploring the other gems of Agra. We ordered a rickshaw to take us to the Agra Fort, the mini Taj, and the Chinni Ka Rauza. Again,
Mini Taj
my favorite part of the day was just watching life pass by as we drove around in our rickshaw. The Agra Fort was majestic and faced the Taj Mahal. We had our first full glimpse of the Taj from the walls of the Agra Fort. The fort is massive and wonderful. It's a shame that most tourists come to Agra just to see the Taj Mahal, this fort is also a must see. We only saw two other western tourists while visiting the fort. Fort Agra was first mentioned in history in 1080 AD when it was recorded that it was captured. My favorite thing to do while waking through historic areas is to think of how it would have looked back in the day. It was neat walking through it's corridors and peeking out the windows catching a look at the Taj in the distance. The mini Taj was beautiful. I loved the colorful and detailed art work on the interior and exterior walls. The front gates are packed with begging children who try to cling on to your pants asking you to buy something from them or for change. It's absolutely heart breaking and if I could I
beautiful details
would do all that I could for them, but sadly you really shouldn't give money to children beggars in the streets because that money more than likely will not be going towards the child. I plan on finding a good organization soon and making donations that way, I just can't visit India and not give back. India has already touched my heart in so many different ways.



The last stop on our day tour was a garden that faces the Taj Mahal from across the river. It's a perfect location for sunset photos. We were joined by other tourists as we gazed at the marvel. Again, we were the only foreign ""western"" tourists and this was noticed immediately by the other tourists. Ben, who has flaming red hair, and I were asked many times to take pictures with the other tourists. Lauren, having a darker skin tone, took the responsibility of taking the pictures and laughing at our predicament. Ben and Lauren were able to get ahead of me at one point and then I was left alone to take pictures. It's like a ripple effect, once you say yes to one… they just don’t stop. I
The Taj Mahal!
had to take pictures of people as well as be in pictures with them. It's flattering but it’s not because I'm pretty (in India this is true because we are usually sweaty and wearing very baggy things) but because of the color of my skin. It got to the point where a mother asked me to hold her baby for a photo and that's when I had to run away waving at my new friends saying goodbye. It had gone too far.



We decided to have dinner at one of the lonely planet top picks in Agra, a rooftop restaurant overlooking the Taj Mahal. We just can't get enough it! The restaurant was very near to the Taj. The locals were enjoying the end of the day by flying kites on their rooftops. I felt like I was in Austin for the kite festival but with a very exotic backdrop. It's a really romantic spot and I caught myself really wishing that my boyfriend were there to enjoy the view with me. It is the monument built out of love! At any rate, it was a perfect end to a really great day exploring Agra. That night,
Lauren, Ben and I
the daughter of the hostel owners drew some henna on my hand. It was really cute to have her work on me, even if the henna art wasn't great. I'm now stained with a cute memory of this 12 year old doing henna. I asked her where I could get some henna and she promised me that she would show me the next day.

We woke up at 5:30 am the next day, our last day in Agra, to visit the Taj Mahal for sunrise. Unfortunately, with all the haze there wasn't much of a sunrise but at least it was still cool enough to enjoy our visit. Being so close to the Taj will forever be edged in my memory. It was so symmetrical and perfect. A beautiful building made in the name of love. We spent the morning just soaking in the splendor of the Taj before we headed back to our hostel for breakfast. A private car would be waiting for us at 2 pm to take us to our next destination, Jaipur. Until then, we rested and prepared for the next journey. Our hostel ""mom"" had her daughter take us to a local shop so
My first attempt at henna
that we could buy henna. Each tube of henna costs about 10 cents usd! We decided to buy 4 to start with. We didn't know if we would do a good job of henna on our own so we didn't want to go crazy. I have hobby of doing nail art when bored so Lauren asked me to do her first henna tattoo. Amazingly enough, I think I did a pretty good job at it! We were told by the son, that in other places the henna tubes could cost 100 ruppes rather than 10 if we aren't with a local, so we ran back to the shop and bought 10 more. We are set for a while! In the states you can get henna done for $15... think I may start a side business!



All in all, I have had an amazing time in Agra and I have been able to cross of another thing off my bucket list, The Taj Mahal. Life is good.

Taj Mahal
From Darjeeling we caught a flight to Delhi which was all a bit of a frustrating experience. There is so much bureaucracy here that it seems to take forever to go through the simplest processes like checking in baggage, going through security, queuing to get on the plane, it was all a bit much!

Once in Delhi we checked out a few of the sights, Red Fort, National Museum, Khan Market (Tom was very excited at being able to buy vegemite). Nothing too impressive about Delhi, just a big, dirty city. At this stage we're feeling a bit mixed about India... the constant noise of horns, rubbish, filth, people spitting everywhere and the relentless hassle from touts / tuk tuk drivers from the minute you step out on to the street is pretty wearing. In Delhi in particular, we found on the whole people to be pretty rude (with the exception of a few friendly people on the train), they constantly seem to be pushing people out the way, pushing in queues and generally just causing unnecessary chaos, and then there is the staring and men who try to take photos of you, bit annoying!

We got the train
Tom and the Taj
to Agra last night so we could get up early in order to beat (some of ) the crowds. Our grose hostel was close to the Taj, we were both pretty excited walking there this morning to check it out. It's certainly impressive, not as big as we expected but the detailed design and the workmanship that must have went into it is amazing. Photos speak for themselves.

We're now in Jaipur, Rajasthan having caught the bus here today. So far there seems to be a bit more of a chilled out feel to the place, despite the heat! We decided to splash out on a $30 a night hotel and its like a palace. We have organised for the hotels tuk tuk driver, Lala to take us round the sights tomorrow, he picked us up from the bus station for free today and took us home after dinner, he is a lovely, honest guy so we'll be sure to pay him well tomorrow. At least there is one tuk tuk driver in India who understands that if he's nice, honest, does us a favour then we're more likely to pay him more in the end! Looking forward to
Outside the Red Fort
a hassle free day of sight seeing tomorrow.

This has probably sounded like a really negative post but from what we hear everyone goes through stages of loving India then hating it. Hopefully we get back to the loving stage again soon.

Agra has two main attractions – the Taj Mahal and the Agra fort. The first is more famous, most probably due to being clean and more westernised than any other place of interest, much more advertised literally everywhere, and charging you much more too. This is not to say the Taj is not nice – it is, but not so special after all, and there is not so much to see to be honest. Agra fort is a remote copy of the Lal Quila inDelhi, or rather the other way round, is a large complex of buildings and a home to monkeys and green parrots. Not as white as Taj, but who cares? Monkeys and parrots are better!

The idea to book a hotel in Agra was a good one, for we had a place to dump the bags and have a shower before boarding on a night train same evening. The prepaid taxi driver from the train station to the hotel was all nice and charming, 2 mins after we had set off he pulled out a notebook with “He is a really nice guy! I really recommend him!” written in Russian, apparently by his Russian lady-friend. How sweet. Next, as usual, he enquired in detail about our travel plans and was aghast to hear that we are only 1 day in Agra.

<!---->- <!---->Oh, and you can hire this car for the whole day! To take you to the Taj and the Fort.

<!---->- <!---->Ummmmm - said I.

The offer was repeated twice more, the last time when we pulled off by the hotel with the Taj clearly in the view.

<!---->- <!---->No thank you.

<!---->- <!---->No?! But how will you get to the Taj?!

<!---->- <!---->It’s just here, we will walk.

<!---->- <!---->And to the Fort?!

<!---->- <!---->Walk too.

<!---->- <!---->It’s very far, it’s not possible!

<!---->- <!---->You know, we walked for 8 hours straight in Delhi yesterday, and it was good – said I. While he was digesting this information, we picked up the bags and hid in the hotel.

Put the bags down, and off to the Taj. No smog here, thus warmer but not unbearable. Once you get to the gate, you are informed that the ticket office is 1 km away, in that direction. Ok, we walk there dodging rikshas and promising a teenage guy called Lucky to have a look at his shop after Taj. Tickets come with a complimentary compulsory bottle of water to foreigners (why only here? A tourist death from overheating at any other monument is probably of minor importance, but the Taj’s reputation can’t be tarnished by anything like this). There are also paid lockers by the ticket window, the message saying “Don’t carry any valuables in your bag”. Allrighty. So back we are at the gates, greeted by Lucky again, yes we will visit your shop we promise, and going through the body scanners and bag checks. I was stupid enough to have the swiss knife and a torch in my pocket, and these two are not allowed inside.

<!---->- <!---->You need to leave these at the lockers.

<!---->- <!---->Are there lockers around here?

<!---->- <!---->No, at the ticket office.

<!---->- <!---->But it’s 1 km away!

<!---->- <!---->Yes. Do you have a guide with you? – these come for only 200 rupees extra.

<!---->- <!---->No.

<!---->- <!---->…..

<!---->- <!---->Call your husband here madam, tell him.

So I do, ignoring the husband bit. Somehow it doesn’t solve anything. Meanwhile my knife and torch are put aside, and I am hopeful I can just pick them up, but no.

<!---->- <!---->Speak to my senior over there, madam. – ok, I face the Senior guy now.

<!---->- <!---->These are not allowed inside. Do you have a guide with you?

<!---->- <!---->No, and I don’t want to walk to the lockers. Can I just leave these things here in a tray and pick them up later?

<!---->- <!---->But anyone can take them from here.

<!---->- <!---->No problem with me.

<!---->- <!---->Ok then.

The knife and torch are in the tray, placed right behind the scanners, and off we go. On the way back I picked them up from exactly the same tray, carefully hidden under a newspaper that was lining it.

<!---->- <!---->It’s so that no-one steals it – I said.

<!---->- <!---->No, it’s so that you can’t find it – said Vanya.



About an hour long walk from the Taj to the Fort was along quite a nice road between the two parks, with no sidewalks and full of eager rikshas. When we stop for a minute to look at the map (strategically walking on the right side of the road, mind you!), a riksha immediately stops by and barricades us with his vehicle. Something clicks in my head and it all stops being annoying, it’s just too funny. “What are you doing?” I asks him and laugh. He laughs too but holds the tuk-tuk where it is. We walk away and he leaves.

Fort done, on the way back we are finally talked into a riksha who swears that he will take us to wherever we want for only 20 rupees, and he has change from a 100. We ask to go to a place where we can get a car taxi. When we are in the tuk-tuk, another guy jumps in, takes a seat next to the driver and they start driving us somewhere. 10 mins later we are at some shady office, giving the riksha 100 rupees.

<!---->- <!---->But I don’t have change! – looks really bemused. Then to his sturman – do you have change?

<!---->- <!---->Noo!

<!---->- <!---->Look, you said you had the change. This is why we went with you. – I’m trying to sound like a school teacher telling off a kid. Amazingly it works, he fished out quite some banknotes and gives us 80 back, smiling happily – thank you!

Further we go by a car, and ask the driver twice if he knows where the hotel is. Yes he does. Then he stops at the petrol station, gets out, pops his head in and says

<!---->- <!---->I need to get petrol

<!---->- <!---->Ok, we’ll wait.

<!---->- <!---->200 rupees.

<!---->- <!---->Ok, you pay, we wait.

<!---->- <!---->270 rupees!

<!---->- <!---->Ok, go pay.

<!---->- <!---->Ok, 100 rupees.

<!---->- <!---->What do you mean?

<!---->- <!---->Money! – he looks at us quite aggressively.

<!---->- <!---->Look, we are not paying you anything now. If you want to buy petrol, pay your own money. We’ll pay you when you bring us to the hotel.

He walks around the car, doesn’t put any petrol in, gets back in and drives quietly to our hotel. Emerges all smileys, opens the door for me with a little bow and a smile, gets the agreed before with his boss money and looking very happily leaves. What the hell? People are trying to cheat you right there and then, but being very straightforward like small kids stealing candies. But if you catch their hand and tell them off, they stop it and behave, with no remorse of course. Is it how is works here? We’ll see.

After having enjoyed the peacefulness and the cooling wind of the Himalayas, we headed for one of the hallmarks of every Indian trip, the magnificent Taj Mahal in Agra. We took an overnight bus from Nainital directly to Agra and arrived there early in the morning to enjoy the Taj at sunrise.

I'm not going to say too much about Banbasa except that I really didn't like it, the people were just simply not nice. It's not a pretty town in fact quite the opposite, and there are no sights to see, well non that I can find. I'm here a couple of days and post some stuff home but even finding the post office involved a 6km bus ride.

The hotel I was staying in was filthy, I asked if they had a shower and the owner asked me to leave... with pleasure. I ended up moving round the corner but they're aggressive people that I just can't take to.

Anyway if your thinking of staying here I would definately recommend against it.

Well i've now been where all good India tourists and nationals must go, the Taj Mahal. It is pretty amazing actually, so big and sparkling and it just looks pretty magic. Loads of tourists but because the place is so huge they seem pretty insignificant. Inside, not quite as exciting as i thought it would be, the place would be alot more spectacular inside with the right lighting... then again they are trying to preserve the stone, so no lights are really allowed in anyway. Pretty amazing though, guaranteed 'wow' sight. would definatley like to go back again sometime, not this trip though since its quite expensive to get in. You should all go!

The rest of Agra I didn't really see, was so tired and only there one day so just concentrated on the Taj. Did have time to pick up some food poisoning though... well i think it was where i had lunch in Agra, starting feeling the effects about 8am the next morning... at the airport... :-(

Cows dining on the Rubbish outside our hotel
No wonder they don't eat beef.
VARANASI TO DELHI. Wednesday 4 April, 2012.

We were woken at 5 am by the next throng of Pilgrims making their way to the Ghats to pray and make offerings of Ganges water to the Sun God. Much chanting and ringing of bells went on for about an hour. After this we managed to go back to sleep and have a bit of a lie in.

Today was a travelling day so not a lot to report. We sat in the cell, D read the newpaper while M wrote a few blogs, until our pickup time at 12.00 noon. We lugged our backpacks through the stinky alleys until we reached the car - which had managed to get down to the Ghats at this time of the day (no Pilgrms!). The drive to the airport took about half and hour. M saw a stark naked bloke wandering down the streeet - and he wasn't a top ranking Jain monk as he didn't have a water pale and a cushion!

Varanasi airport, in contrast to the city, was immaculate and modern. Immigration was the same, scan your hand luggage then stamp the label, scan you then stamp your boarding
Our Hotel from the River
pass. We were not sad to be leaving Verynasty. M will never smell incense sticks again (they use it to mask the smell of the sh1t - unsuccessfully) without feeling a bit sick. We have included some photos of our 'hotel' with this blog.

The flight to Delhi was an hour late. Mr Barun was waiting for us in the Arrival Hall at Delhi Airport. He drove us the half hour to our hotel wich was called The Residence and is located in South Delhi.

The hotel is one of the best yet. The room was lovely. We had a couple of G and T's then ate a good meal there before retiring. Tomorrow we have a tour of Delhi to look forward to. Pick up 9.30 am - so another lie in.

Dhobi Ghat - Laundry Ghat
VARANASI AND SARNATH, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA. Tuesday 3 April, 2012.

Varanasi is located on the River Ganges and its waterfront is dominated by the long flights of stone steps or Ghats that we had seen last night at the ceremony. Thousands of pilgrims and residents come to the ghats for their daily ablutions. Known to the devout as Kashi the Luminous - the City of Light, founded by Shiva, Varanasi is one of the oldest living cities in the world. It has maintained its religious heritage since the 6th century BC in one continuous tradition, and stands at the centre of the Hindu universe.

It is the focus of a religious geography that stretches from Kashmir in the Himalayan mountains to India's southern tip at Kanniyakumari, Puri to the east and Dwarka to the west. It is located on a ford on the river and is among the holiest of all tirthas ('crossing place'😉 These tirthas allow the devotee access to the divine, and enable the gods and goddesses to come down to earth. So, in short, it is a really, really, really important place if you are a Hindu.

We awoke before the crack of dawn in
M and D on Ganges at Sunset
order to meet our guide for the day in the hotel reception. Our guide, Ajay, was waiting and immediately led us down the hotel steps to the river bank where there was a young boy waiting for us with a rowing boat. The sun was still not up as we were rowed south along the river. There were hundreds of pilgrims on the river banks - and hundreds of boats full of tourists watching them. From the boat we had a much better view of the ghats which line the west bank. Above the concrete terraces there are 18th and 19th century pavilions, temples and palaces (of which our 'hotel' was one). There were people bathing in the filthy water among the floating debris preparing to pray and make offerings of the sacred water to the sun as it rose over the east bank.

There was a Brahmin priest offering Puja. Ajay informed us that they only send out one priest for the morning rituals (unlike the ceremony last night when there were quite a few). There was a group of young girls practising yoga and several people meditating among the piles of rubbish on the terraces.

We
Bathers
couldn't believe that people were actually swimming in the water - it was so filthy. Ajay told us that Hindus believe that the Ganges is amrita - the elixir of life (more like elixir of death!) which brings purity to the living and salvation to the dead - they even take Ganges water back to their homes and put drops of it in their cooking. In reality the river is scummy with effluent (our hotel probably being one of the contributors - there is no sewage system), contains chemicals and heavy metals from factories upstream and human body parts from the cremations sites (more of these later). Whether Ganga water still has the power to absolve sin if sterilized is a contentious point among the faithful. Ajay told us that current thinking is that it is ok to boil it but that chemical treatment ruins it and causes it to lose its powers.

We continued southwards along the river until we reached Dhobi (Laundrymen's) Ghat. Here clothes are washed in the Ganga water and smashed against the stone terraces in pursuit of purity. M looked a bit concerned and asked Ajay where the hotels did their laundry. To her
Cremation Site
relief Ajay replied that most of them had their own mechanical washing machines (the waste from which probably ends up in the Ganga water cocktail).

We continued south until we reached Manikarnika Ghat which is one of Varanasi's cremation sites. The entire city of Varanasi is regarded as the 'Great Cremation Ground for the corpses of the entire universe'. Anyone who dies in Varanasi attains instant moksha, or enlightenment. The elderly come here to live out their final days, finding shelter in the temples assisted by alms from the faithful. The ghat is looked after by Doms, the guardians from the Untouchable Caste busy keeping the 'eternal flame' burning (all funeral pyres are lit from this flame), and facilitating the final release for those lucky enough to pass away here. There were a couple of people sifting through the ashes and washing them in the river. Ajay explained that they were looking for bits of molten jewellery and any gemstones that may have been left on the corpses.

We turned around and headed north up the river. The sun was now rising over the east bank and cast a lovely orange glow over the river. We passed another
D with Illegal Foil on Stupa
cremation site with piles and piles of wood stored outside ready for the next body to arrive. Ajay explained that the cost of a cremation here was dependent on how wealthy the family were. We came to a halt just north of this cremation site and disembarked the row boat.

Ajay then took us to a temple with a gold plated dome. We were not allowed inside as you had to be a Hindu. The place was more heavily guarded than Fort Knox. Apparently there is a dispute between the Hindu's and the Moslems in this area. The Moslem temple has been built on the site of the original Hindu temple and the Hindu's want it back. Its a very big deal - hence the heavy armoury and police. We continued on through the stinky alleys, dodging cows, dogs, people and two wheelers travelling at breakneck speeds, back to the hotel. Ajay left us here to have our breakfast (it was still only 7.30 am) he would retrun at 10.30 for our tour.

Ajay arrived on time and we walked back through the alleys to the waiting car and driver. We drove 10 kilometers north of Varanisi to
No Foil Sign
the ruins and temples at Sarnath which are a pilgramage centre for Buddhists. It was here, only 5 weeks after his enlightenment, that Buddha gave his first ever sermon. According to Buddhist belief this set in motion the Dharmachakra ('Wheel of Law'😉, a new cycle of rebirths and reincarnations eventually leading to ultimate enlightement for everybody. Hence it is a VIP (Very Important Place).

First we went to Mulagandha Temple, the prime place of worship for the Buddhist community. Built in 1931, the buidling contains some attractive frescoes and is said to contain the sacred relics of Sakyamuni Buddha. We then walked to the main archeological site which is dominated by the huge bulk of the Dhamekh Stupa.

The stupa is said to mark the place where Buddha delivered his first serman and was built in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ashoka. M asked Ajay if it contained any relics. Apparently it is empty. Most of the site is in ruins but you can still see the remains of the main shrine where Ashoka is said to have meditated. Ajay left us alone to wander around the site.

The first important ruins on the
Dhamekh Stupa
site were the remains of the Ashokan Pillar. These are the fragment of a 15.25 meter high monolithic pillar created by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (272-232) made of Chunar Sandstone. These remains bear the typical Mauryan type of polish. The cylindrical shaft is slightly tapering with a diameter of 0.71 meters at the base and 0.56 meters at the top. It was once surmounted by the famous four addorsed Lion Capital, which is an excellent example of the Mauryan Art, which we were to see later in the State Museum. This emblem still appears on Indian bank notes. The pillar bears 3 inscriptions, the earliest one is an edict of Ashoka in Brahmi Script where the King warns the monks and nuns against creating Schism in the Sangha. The second mentions the 40th year of the Kushana King Asvaghosha of Kaushamsi and the 3rd is an early Gupta Brahmi Script refering to the teachers of the Sammitiya Sect and of the Vastiputrak School. We took some photographs and continued looking around the grounds. We watched people sticking bits of gold leaf on the Stupa - then saw the sign that told you not to.

We were then taken to
Cremation Site
a silk weaving factory. We saw how they wove silk in both the old fashioned way (with two people) and the modern way using a contraption with punched cards - rather like old fashioned computer punch paper tape. We had great trouble avoiding the hard sell at the end. We then went to the Bharat Kala Bhavan Museum where there were some great paintings. We returned to the hotel where over a Kingfisher D decided that Varinasi should have a new English name. We now call it Verynasty. And it is!

Taj Mahal at Dawn
TAJ MAHAL, & THE RED FORT, AGRA, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA. Saturday March 31, 2012.

The phone woke us up at 6.15 as were being collected by Sachin and Mr Berun at 6.30 so we could get to the Taj Mahal and be inside before the sun came up.

Apparently, the Taj Mahal looks completely different throughout the day as the sun moves around the building and sunrise and sunset are the two best times of the day to see it. We queued for our entry with all the other early birds - mainly white tourists. There were four separate queues to get in. Two for foreign men and women, and two for Indian men and women. Sachin had warned us the night before not to bring anything except a small bottle of water, wallet and a camera. The men’s queue moved fairly swiftly but the women’s was painfully slow. This was because nearly all of them were carrying handbags which had to be meticulously searched before they were allowed in. As a result the sun was already up when we got in.

The Taj Mahal overlooks the Yamuna River and stands at the end of a vast, walled
M with the Inlay and Carved Marble Work
garden. This amazing building is Islamic in style and is a monument to romantic love. Shah Jahan built the Taj to enshrine the body of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal (""Chosen One of the Palace""), who died shortly after giving birth to her 14th child in 1631. This number of children reflected how important she was to the Emperor as he had many other wives and concubines on whom he could call. The emperor was devastated by her death and wanted to create an unsurpassable monument to her memory and its name 'Taj Mahal' is simply an informal version of the title of the palace in which Mumtaz lived.

The building took over 20 years to complete. The white marble was brought from Makrana in Rajasthan and semi-precious stones were used for decoration. Onyx, amethyst, lapis, lazuli, turquoise, jade, crystal, coral and mother of pearl were imported from Persia, Russia, Afghanistan, Tibet, China and the Indian Ocean. Later, Shah Jahan's nasty piece of work of a son seized power and imprisoned the Emperor in Agra Fort, where he lived out his final years gazing at the Taj Mahal. When he died in 1666, his body was carried across the
M and D in the Taj Grounds
river to lie alongside his beloved wife in the Taj Mahal.

We entered through an arched gateway topped with domes and adorned with Koranic verses and inlaid floral designs. Sachin asked us whether we thought the inscriptions on the structure were the same size. They looked like they were, but apparently the ones at the top are much larger to cater for the difference in perspective to the human eye. The result is that the verses and floral designs seem to be exactly the same size. Amazing given that this was erected in the 17th century!

Once through the gateway we could see the Taj at the end of a long garden split into four quadrants by waterways. The building seemed to be calling you in as you went through the archway, slowly revealing its splendor. Sachin advised us to take photographs at all stages as we passed through. Once through the archway, we took some photographs of the Taj with its reflection in the water. You can only do this in the morning and evening when the fountains are switched off.

We walked through the gardens until we reached the steps which lead up to the
M and D outside the Red Fort
high square platform on which the mausoleum sits. Each corner is marked by a tall tapering minaret. Sashin explained that the minarets lean out at an angle of 3 degrees so that if there is an earthquake they will fall away from the building. They are also there to act as kind of lightning rods to divert any lightning strikes away from the main building.

We climbed the steps to the entrance, and, although we were both looking forward to seeing this iconic monument at last, neither of us were prepared for it to make such an impression as it did. We have both seen hundreds of photos and read about this building but the reality was overwhelming. Others have tried (and failed) to describe its perfection and more words by us cannot to do it justice. Its magic was not spoiled by the crowds of tourists. According to Sachin the monument is at its most alluring at this time of day, bathed in a soft red glow. As the vast marble surfaces are touched by the sun the colour changes from a soft grey and yellow to cream and then dazzling white. The semi-precious stones light up as
Tradesment shaping the Stones on the Stone Wheels
they reflect the sunlight and the translucent marble glows in the sun's rays. It was stunning. Sachin pointed out the beautiful inlaid marble on the facade and showed us the different semi precious stones used to create the different colours.

Once inside we found ourselves in a high octagonal chamber whose walls glowed in the pale light. A marble screen, decorated with precious stones and cut so finely it seems almost translucent, protects the cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal which is positioned dead centre, perfectly aligned with the doorway and the gateway through which we entered. The cenotaph of Shah Jahan lies next to it, to the right, and is the only object which breaks the perfect symmetry of the entire complex. The reason that his tomb is to her right is that his body faces Mecca and her body faces him. The cenotaphs, in accordance with Mughal tradition, are only representations of the real coffins, which lie in the same positions in a crypt below. The crypt is no longer open to the public.

From inside the Taj you can see the four entrances. Each are identical and in perfect symmetry both inside and out. From the outside
Jahangir's Cistern
the building looks exactly the same from all 4 sides - the only difference being the way the light is falling at the time you are looking. We strolled around the grounds for a while and then went back to the homestay for breakfast - it was still well before 9.00 am!! We were to be collected at 10.30 for our next excursion to the Red Fort.

We were collected on time and taken to the Delhi Gate of Agra Fort (a.k.a. The Red Fort). We walked up to the Hathi Pol (Elephant Gate) which is flanked by two red sandstone towers faced in marble. In days gone by this gate was guarded by colossal stone elephants with riders, but these have been long since destroyed in battle. Still the name remains. We turned left and continued to the entrance which is through the Amar Singh Pol (Pol means gate) which is actually 3 separate gates placed adjacent to each other at right angles to deprive any elephant cavalry attackers of space, disorientate them and slow them down to reduce the effects of elephants battering the fortifications.

We then climbed gently uphill flanked by high defensive walls and
M at the Taj in the Evening
through a second gate into the spacious courtyard. This courtyard is now laid to lawn and studded with trees. These gardens were introduced by the British. The courtyard surrounds the Diwan-i-Am (Public Audience Hall). This pillared hall is open on three sides. The original structure would have been made of wood and scattered with luxurious carpets and the ceiling would have been covered with satin canopies.

We continued on past many different royal pavilions until we reached the Shish Mahal (Glass Palace). This was built by the Mogul King Shah Jahan as a summer palace. It has two tanks with fountains connected by a canal and a waterfall which are designed to keep the building cool in the summer. The distinctive feature of this building is the glass mosaic work which has been done on the walls. The royal women would have bathed here in the soft lamplight reflected from the glass pieces in the mosaics on the walls and ceilings. We could only look through the gates at this spectacle as unscrupulous tourists had been nicking all the glass bits as souvenirs!

We continued on to the Jahangiri Mahal (Jahangir's Palace) which was actually built for Jahangir's
Taj at Sunset
father Akbar as a harem. This robust sandstone structure has a lot of Hindu elements mixed with traditional Mughal and Islamic designs, unlike the rest of the fort which has largely Mughal architecture. Immediately in front of this palace is Jahangir's Hauz (Jahangir's Cistern), a giant bowl with steps inside and out which was used as a spa or jacuzzi. It was made from a single block of porphyry and inscribed in Persian. It would have been filled with rosewater and, it is said, was carried around with the Emperor on his travels through the empire - not sure about this as it is enormous and not easily portable!

Our next stop was the customary hard sell at a place called the Subhash Emporium. We were taken to a place where they inlay white marble with semi-precious stones using the same methods as they would have when the Taj was built. We watched carefully as the process was explained to us. Having seen the marble at the Taj, this process came to life and was even more impressive. Some of the pieces were as small as a strand of hair and were shaped on stone grinding wheels that were
M and D by the River at the Taj at Sunset
controlled with a bow. When M asked how they could see such tiny pieces and get them so accurate the owner explained that they do it by feel and touch as the pieces are much too small to see the shapes properly. Different craftsmen complete different parts of the process. Having watched the grinding we saw how the marble was marked with a pattern and then carefully carved out up to a depth of around quarter of an inch (6mm). We then saw a third craftsman placing the semi precious stones in the right place and fixing them with a glue. This is the same glue that was used to fix the stones in the Taj facade and the recipe is a closely guarded secret. D bought a present for M as it is her 50th this year and a gift for his daughter Ellie who is 18 in July.

We then went for lunch and a rest at the Homestay. We were collected again at 4.30 in order to return to the Taj Mahal to see it at sunset. It was still as stunning as it was this morning but looked completely different as the light was falling
M and D at the Taj in the Evening
on different sides of the building. This time we looked at the Yamuna River and the red sandstone mosque to the west. There is an identical building to the east which was only added to maintain the symmetry of the complex. It cannot be used as a mosque, because it faces away from Mecca, and so was used as a guest house.

We were taken to a place called A Touch of Spice for dinner on Sanchin's recommendation. The food was excellent and the portions were enormous. Mr Barun took us back to the Homestay. We both felt that this day had far surpassed our expectations and that the only way to do the beauty of the Taj Mahal justice is to go and see it in person.

. Diwan-i-Am with Emperor's Platform
FATEHPUR SIKRI, UTTAR PREDESH, INDIA. Friday 30, March 2012.

We were up and about at the same time as we were yesterday for the game drive - but today was to be our first taste of the Indain railways. The railways are said to be the best legacy left by the British. We were collected and taken to Sawai Madhopur Station near Ranthambhore. We waited on the platform with our agent for the train.

The platform was full of street children and the homeless begging for food and money - so we parted with a couple of packets of crisps. We were warned not to part with any cash as we would be surrounded immediately by hundreds of kids. There were rats running along the back on the platform and dogs and doggie do do's all over the place. The smell of the tracks was revolting. Next to the tracks were lines of hoses that are used to clean the trains' toilets when they arrive at the platform. It is the waste from these toilets that was causing the dreadful smell. The litter was appalling. We boarded our first class C 'chair' carriage and took our seats.

Our
.Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience)
luggage had gone ahead with Mr Barun yesterday, so we only had a couple of rucksacks which was a bonus. The journey to Bharatpur Station took us about two and half hours and we were met by the agent who was waiting outside our carriage. He took us to the waiting Mr Barun. We drove towards our next destination Fatehpur Skiri which is, to this day, one of India's architectural masterpieces. Just outside Fatehpur Sikri we picked up our guide, Sachin, who was to stay with us until we left Agra.

The ghost city of Fatehpur Sikri , former capital of the great Mughal Emperor Akbar, straddles the crest of a rocky ridge 40 km south-west of Agra. The city was built here between 1569 and 1585. Akbar wanted to create a new capital that was an appropriate symbol of his imperial power. The fusion of Hindu and Muslim influences in the architecture says a lot about the religious and cultural tolerence of the time and is the reason why this place is of such architectural interest and importance.

After 1585 it never again served as the seat of the emperor, and nobody really knows why the city
Anup Talao (Peerless Pool)
was abandoned. A popular theory is that the water supply could not sustain the growing population, but other historians believe that the relocation took place for strategic military reasons. When the emperor returned to the locality after some military encounters in Punjab he chose to return to Agra rather than Fatehpur Sikri.

We started our tour at Diwan-i-Am which is basically a large courtyard surrounded by a continuous collonaded walkway with Hindu style columns and capitals. The area was grassed over and planted as a garden by the British, but would have been an open courtyard in the Emperor's time. The Emperor would have sat in the royal platform so that the citizens could make petitions to him. We proceeded to the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience) courtyard which is topped with 4 chatris and embellished with carved Hindu-style brackets.

Next we went to the Treasury Building which, according to Sachin, was never used as a treasury at all. It consists of 3 rooms and is also known as 'Blind Man's Buff House' as it is great for playing the ancient game. The corbels projecting from the walls in this building are notable for their carvings derived from
M and D in the Astrologer's Seat
the style of the Jain Temple in Western India. Attached to the Treasury buildings is a small pavilion called the 'Astrologer's Seat' also embellished with elaborate Jain carvings.

Next we went to the Anup Talao (Peerless Pool) which has a balustraded platform in the centre which is approached by 4 causeways. The platform was used for entertainment purposes. We continued to the Panch Mahal (Five Storeyed Palace) and then on to the women's quarters (Akbar had a huge harem of around 5,000 women!). The women's quarters make up the entire western side of the palace - unsurprising as there were all those women and their children.

We left the Fatehpur Sikri complex by a different gate and the three of us took a tuk tuk down to the nearby Jama Masjid Mosque. We did not enter the mosque but Sachin wanted us to see the Buland Darwaza (Great Gate). This neck-cricking entrance to the mosque is spectacular and is reached by a huge, steep flight of steps. Sachin told us a little of the history of the building before we climbed aboard the tuk tuk and retuned to the car park and the waiting Mr Barun.

We
Buland Darwaza (Great Gate
continued on to Agra where we were deposited at our accommodation. We were not in a hotel this time but a homestay. This is where you stay in a room in someone's house. The house was in a gated community in a somewhat skanky suburb of Agra. The house was lovely with a well kept garden. The room was clean, roomy, modern and comfortable. As there was nowhere to eat at the homestay Mr Barun took us for a very late lunch. It was a bit of a rip off but was enough to curb our hunger. So much so that we told Mr Barun that we would not need to go out again to eat today. We stopped at a 'Wine Shop' and Mr Barun got us a couple of Kingfishers (he gets Indian prices of 70 rupees where we get charged 5 times that) to take back to the hotel. We watched TV, skyped a few people back home, caught up with some blogs and went to bed.

09.00 Hours Monday 26 March

I said the I was not sure I get Varanasi and that still stands. I am getting used to the place a bit more but it's a tough place to get to the bottom of and I won't this time.

The place is a total one off from the smell and the cowshit everywhere to the burning bodies and the bodies just floating along the river. The worshiping side of things is a big affair and a sight to behold. Anyway a few lines won't do it justice so I will leave it at that.

An awesome coincidence :

I booked my train ticket for the Varanasi - Kolkata leg on the 29th December. I always travel during the night in 3AC. When I met Mira a few days ago it got a mention in passing that she was going to Kolkata to catch a plane to Bangkok. Oh I think it's on Monday she says.



A bit later we find that we are on the same train. And now this morning when I tell her my coach and berth number , she is in the same coach and in the berth above me. Really Weird.

We will get a taxi to the railway station in a few hours and will arrive in Kolkata at 08.30 in the morning.

Ganpati Room
20.00 Hours 22 March

I take a rick back to Agra Idgah but this time to the railway station. My ticket is confirmed but I do not have my Coach/Berth number so I go to the ticket office and the man goes on the railway internet site and gets my details for me. I am all sorted.

Now to wait for the train and wait I did. It’s over an hour late, but I find my berth and start to get sorted for the night. I chain and padlock my ruck to the underside of my seat and get my bedding from the attendant. Next stop is Agra fort and loads of backpackers get on here. All on our way to the Hindi centre of the universe Varanasi.

I sleep well and wake up at 6 and get some chai at one of the stations we stop at.

The train is 2.5 hours late and we arrive in Varanasi at 11.30. I had arranged a pick up and a; lad if there with a card with Mr Paul on it.

We go towards Varanasi. The rick stops and I have too walk the last 2k as
Ganpati Room
the lanes are top small for a rick.

Into the Ganpati Guest House which is very nice. A move up to 1000 rups a night gets you a flat screen TV (wall to wall Bollywood dancing) 2 bath towels, 2 soap, 2 toilet rolls

A go out for a walk. The lanes are so small and there are turns left and right every what seems 20 yards. I am lost and head towards the river and back to the guesthouse. That happens three more times that afternoon.

I go for something to eat on the rooftop after that come down to meet Mira from Utrecht in Holland and Kevin from Oregon in the US.

They are off to do a sunrise boat ride on the Ganges and invite me along. 05.45 In the morning it is so off to bed.

05.30 Hours Saturday 24 March

We walk along the Ghats and find the boat that Mira had booked. Kevin buys some small flowers in a leaf cup with a candle.

George Harrison was cremated in England and then his ashes were brought hers and scattered on the Mother Ganga. So I drop my
Ganpati from the Gnat
flowers and candle in the water for a fellow scouser and watch it float away.

Kevin spots a corpse in the river and takes the oars and rows over to it, the smell is stomach turning. Anyway that’s the way it is here. If they are not floating the river they are burning on the bank. And all around washing and bathing goes on.

Balau the boat owner rows over to the far side of the river and we get out. Kevin being that over forty free spirit decides it time to spark up a fat one and the day spiraled out of control from there.

WE walk for miles into the country and Kevin turns into the typical American tourist and takes pictures of kinds of village life.

Anyway after a long while we return to the boat. A boat on the river should cost for 3 and for the time we were in it a max of 600 rups. . Kevin decides he’s had a great time and gives the boat owner 500 rups. Mira does the same so I in for 500 as well

A good day to be a boat owner
Ganpati reception
on the Ganges.

We go back to the Ganpati for breakfast and it’s decided that we will go for a wander at lunchtime. We walk the gnats and have lunch somewhere Mira was at yesterday

We stop for a beer on the way back and sit about for hours listening to music and watching all life and death on the banks of the Ganges.

I say goodbye to Kevin as he is off to some tiger reserve in the morning, and tell Mira I will see her tomorrow

08.00 Hours Sunday 25 March

A nice slow day today after the madness of yesterday. Have a sit down and chill. This afternoon Mirs wants some company to go shopping so a stroll of the town it is.

PS: I do not know why , but I am not to sure I get this place. It was a bit like that in Bundi for other reasons and then Bundi grew on me and I had a goos stay. But Varanasi might be one place in India that remain closed for me!!!!!!

P1030284
09.00 Hours Sunday 25 March

A slow day today and a very lazy morning. Just went out to buy from stuff and do a bit on the blog. Mira said we would meet up at lunch time and go walkabout.

About this time I managed to lock myself out of my room by snapping shut my padlock and leaving all the keys inside. No problem at the Ganpati , just a small challenge to one of the boys and he got the door open quick time. So I dropped him 200 rups.



I had spoken to a Israeli girl when I arrived and she left to go to Gaya in Bihar for a few days. I saw her when she came back and she was with Mira when we met at lunchtime. Her name is Galit is a very confident type of lady.

We went to a restaurant that Galit had been before , but it was closed so we went over the road and sat on floor and had some lunch. Back along the gnats and watch the Puja and take a few photos.

And had a good few laughs along the way.
P1030285
Galit was a good sport as I said that she was probably a Mosad assassin and just completed a mission. That's the way she confidently strolls around the streets.

Galit was leaving for Delhi early in the morning and Mira and me are leaving for Kolkata (Calcutta). A really nice touch , Galit gave Mira and me a star of David bracelet that she had brought from Israel.

Taj rooftop view
14.00 Hours Wednesday 21 March

I get back to the Falcon GH and have some lunch and pay my bill.

I have a bit of lunch and then it is off to get the bus to Agra. The bus stop is just round the corner on the same Jaipur Agra road I travelled the other morning.

I wait at the stop and try to find some shade as it is again a warm one. First bus is not for me and the second which is to Agra is full . Back into the shade. 20 Minutes and another bus comes, this time it’s to Agra and I am on.

I sit next to a lad called Michael from Frankfurt and no sooner then we had said hello when in the seats in front are 2 of the volunteers from Holi in Jodhpur.

We talk all the way to Agra. As we approach the traffic is appalling and it takes us 35 minutes to get round 1 corner.

One of the girls from Jodhpur has the name of a guesthouse in Agra that is supposed to be OK and has Taj views. We all decide to
P1030179
go there when we get off the bus and see if it’s ok.

The bus drops us at Agra Idgah some 6/7 k from Tajganj which is the area of the Taj and most of the touristy hotels.

Michael was super cool as we are surrounded by rick drivers, and sorts us two ricks to the Saniya Hotel. We arrive have a look at the rooms which are ok and we are in. The girls arrive shortly afterwards.

As I am going up to my room I meet at guy called Eggi also from Frankfurt who I was with for a short time in Bundi.

After a freshen up we all go to the rooftop restaurant and have a beer and a look at the view of the Taj and of course take a few photo’s.

Michaeland me decide to get up early and go to the Taj before the AC buses arrive. So we say goodbye to Eggi who is off to Delhi to fly home. Off to bed.

05.00 Hours Thursday 22 March

Up early to get to the Taj and join the queue for a ticket. We meet Keith from
Michael & Eggi
New Zealand and he is about every now and again. Into the Taj and everyone goes for the money shots, finger on the top of the Taj, the Diana seat Etc Etc.

The Taj is more impressive then I thought it would be and somehow has a feel. WE spend 3 hours wandering about but by 9ish it’s getting packed and we decide to go back and have breakfast.

After that it the Red Fort and then what is know as the Baby Taj across the river.

It’s now late afternoon and I have to leave tonight for Varanasi so back to the hotel to eat and get my ruck which is locked away in Michael’s room.

On the rooftop sitting having a beer and watching the light fade on the Taj we are joined by Angie from Airdrie a lawyer and she is a barrel of laughs. The next few hours pass quickly and soon it’s time to say goodbye and go off for my Train.

Ganga Aarti
Varanasi, the religious capital of Hinduism, is possibly the oldest living city in the world. We arrive just in time to witness the Ganga Aarti or “Offering Prayer to the Ganges,” a ritual performed every night on the banks of the Ganges River. The Bazaar that lines both sides of the street leading to the Dasaswamedh Ghat where the prayer takes place each night is hopping with activity. Often referred to simply as the evening prayer or dinner prayer, many people come out to participate in the prayer service and thus the merchants are all still open in the hopes of making their last sales of the day to the people attending. Our large bus can’t navigate the narrow streets of the bazaar safely so we are dropped off a ways away and we take rickshaws in as far as we can, walking the remaining 500 meters that even the rickshaws are unable to navigate.

Much of the community comes out for the evening prayer service. There are people everywhere, both tourists and locals, jockeying for a spot where they will have a good view of the 7 Brahmin priests making the offering of incense, sandalwood, Ghee, and camphor. The
Sunrise on the Ganges
offering is made in all four directions. People mill about the crowd: children selling souvenirs to the tourists; priests blessing people and marking their foreheads with a dot on the third eye to remind them of the connection between their spiritual self and their body; and of course as is the case everywhere in India, beggars. Both the “tourist beggars” who aggressively attempt to bully tourists into giving donations and “real beggars” who sit at the edge of the crowd holding their bowl out and patiently awaiting kindness to be bestowed upon them. Everyone comes to the evening prayer. No matter what your lot in life, no matter what caste you may have been born into (for although the discriminating caste system is for the most part defunct everyone is still keenly aware of the caste they were born in to and in the more rural communities caste plays a bigger role in society then one would hope), and no matter how devoted you are to your faith, the River Ganges is for everyone – all are equal at the banks of this mighty river.

Early the following morning, before sunrise, we return to the Ganges. The bazaar has
Sunrise prayers
not yet come to life. There are far fewer people making the pilgrimage to the river than there were last night; it is only the truly devout that begin each day with this morning ritual that has occurred for centuries. At dawn, pilgrims converge at the holy waters for the ritual immersion and prayer to release their souls from the cycle of rebirth. Where I see polluted water that we have been emphatically warned not to swim in they see the opportunity to cleanse themselves with the sacred. Women in their brightly colored saris wade into the river, steadying one another so as not to slip on the stone steps, one washing the other’s hair. Having begun their day with this sacred devotion to their faith, they are ready to take on the secular tasks that await them.

We decided we needed to move on from Jaipur sad that we missed the number one thing to see on trip advisor but very happy we saw holi and the elephant fest which were probably once in a lifetime experiences.

We tried to get the train out of Jaipur but were unable to due to them being full, so far we have a 0%!s(MISSING)uccess rate with the trains as everytime they are full. The system is pretty useless unless booked way in advance, so we had to get the bus. The bus left at the awful time of 6.30am so we forced ourselves out of bed and got to the station. On arrival we had to avoid the local scam of trying to take your bags for you, ended up Litterally having to grab onto to our wheely backpacks while explaining to the man that to wheel a bag is no trouble and we can manage on our own. He walked off annoyed. The bus journey went pretty fast as I think I slept most of it only 5 or so hours. We stopped and a man came on the bus telling us it was our stop, we got off and got our bags out avoiding the shouts of ‘rickshaw’ ‘taxi’. Still sleep, something didn’t feel right as the address that we were looking for was not in site. After blanking the man shouting tuk tuk at us and asking the driver, we realised this was one stop to early so back on the bus!! While looking up something later we found this was a common scam by tuk tuk drivers who then go on to charge you a lot for the journey to the correct stop. Why they allow them on the bus in the first place I don’t know.



Hotel we are staying at in Agra is called the tourist rest house owned by the same people who owned our last hotel the Sunder palace. It’s not great, nice staff apart from the restaurant, no hot water, wifi occasionally, 1 English tv channel and sort of clean but with a bad smell which we worked out seems to be the smell of Agra. The person who picked us up tried to scam us for a visit to the Taj Mahal charging 650 ruppees for services that even he wasn’t really able to justify for the cost. He is also the waiter at the hotel restaurant. We decided to eat out the first night as the Hotel restaurant couldn’t cook anything we wanted and all we got was a blank look from the waiter. The kind of look like he hates us, hates his job and is probably not going to wash his hands before preparing our food. They must recycle their glass bottles here (good) as every Pepsi bottle looks like it is from the 80s and has the thick crust of dirt round the top to prove it (bad).

I left the hotel feeling rough and sneezing due to the lack of sleep, food and hygiene that we take for granted. I can only imagine my body being confused after going from 8 hours sleep , daily raw vegy juice and smoothies and a reasonable level of hygeine to pretty much nothing. This was taking it’s toll so we decided a good meal would help. Outside the hotel a very thin and very old Indian man peddled up to us at about 1 mph on his cycle rickshaw. We denied the offer as honestly we felt guilty making this man peddle us anywhere as people at his age back home generally can’t walk or even change a tv channel. We carried on walking, dodging other offers till the man caught up with us saying this was his Indian helicopter and very good for environment. This made us laugh so we agreed as he seemed to really want the business. On the 2k journey to Taj Ganj where we wanted to eat, the guilt did not stop, it was frankly terrible watching an elderly Indian man peddle two young and reasonably fit English people around. We felt so bad in the end we asked if I could peddle and he could sit in the back with Laura. He said no as the police were around and it may not be allowed so the guilt continued. We paid 100 ruppees for the journey 20 more than asked and agreed he could take us the next morning to the Taj Mahal at 6am.



We eat on the rooftop of a place which claimed to have a good view of the Taj, it wasn’t a great view but the huge veg thali hit the spot. After this I did some more sneezing choked on toothpaste so bad I was nearly sick then called it a day and went to bed as I felt awful. Laura did a good job and booked our ticket out of here to Delhi and then down south to Kerala online as we couldn’t get to varranassi at all, which is a disappointment as we have heard it described as the dirtiest place in India and a real eye opener which is always good to hear, when we thought what we were already seeing was bad enough.



Today we visited the taj mahal and Agra fort. The morning was awkward as the scamming tuk tuk man caught us in the lobby thinking we agreed at his stupid 650 ruppee fare we just said no and got on our dodgy peddle powered one instead to make a slow exit. The old man looked even more frail early in the morning, wrapped in a dirty shawl and possibly thinner than yesterday we had our fingers crossed that he had a good breakfast and the snorts coming from the front where just the usual Indian mans spitting and hacking and not his last breaths. We got to the west entrance of the Taj and walked the short journey to the gate. We got there for 6am like everyone recommended unfortunately as expected everyone else did this too so the queue was still big. After paying the huge 750 entrance fee and another queue we finally got in. Where we’re the rides???



Unfortunately no rides not even a log flume but the building made up for that. It was nice, I was expecting it to be a huge disappointment as it is hyped so much but it is good to see and well worth the trip and photo op. We then went to Agra fort which was ok. Worth seeing but didn’t blow me away. The history around it is interesting so we need to do some reading on it. After that we went back to the hotel after the usual detour round the tuk tuk shops. I did get to peddle a tuk tuk though as again we felt bad and he let me do it. India so far has been mad, dirty, unorganised, amazing, colourful, dodgy, and pretty much any other adjective you can think of but also annoying and tiring at times too, and we have just done the touristy things!! We are off now to Delhi then Kerala which were hoping is more relaxing.

Speak soon Namaste

Jonny

Hey everyone,
I am still in Rishekesh. It's so hard to leave. I moved to Laxman Jula Yesterday which is very beautiful! I found this amazing orphanage here that a young Brazilian girl started up a few years ago. They have this amazing restaurant in this Garden and all the profits go to the orphanage. I think I will stay here and help out in the restaurant and orphanage for a while and continue doing my yoga classes everyday! I'm sharing a room with this young 20yr old Canadian guy. His name is Eli. We have become great friends. It is like having a younger brother around. The room is only costing me 150r which is so cheap! I'm booked into the meditation retreat from 27th March - 5th April in Daramasala. It's going to be very cold up there. I bought a sleeping bag and paid far too much. I have a new rule. I am not allowed to buy anything after a yoga class. I am too nice, trusting and loving. The more I am traveling the more I want to keep traveling. I have never had these feelings before! I love It! I will now try to add some photos. Love to you all!!!

Und wieder im Zug.
Geo: 27.1276, 83.4961

Da ist er also: der Tag an dem es Abschied nehmen heisst.
Heute trennen sich unser und Shahid's Weg. Wir recherchieren erst noch im
Internet, wie wir wohl nach Kathmandu kommen, werden aber nicht final schlau
und beschliessen unser Glueck einfach zu versuchen und zum Bahnhof zu fahren.
Irgendwo stand, dass es um 12:00 einen Zug nach Gorakphur geben soll. Das
wuerde dann 7 Std. Bus gegen 7 Std. Bahn eintauschen, welches mir nur recht
waere.

Zuerst gehen wir nach einigem hin und her noch etwas
fruehstuecken, nehmen dann die Rikscha zum Hotel und checken aus. Vor dem Hotel
springen wir in eine Autorikscha, die einen Japaner in unser Guesthouse bringt;
- eine schlechte Idee, denn der Junge meint eine heisse Dusche zu brauchen und
die gibt es im Vishnu Guest House nicht… Zu sechst fahren wir also weiter und
in der Angst den einzigen Zug zu verpassen, scheint es auch ewig zu dauern, bis
der Fahrer dann nach dem zweiten Stopp zum Glueck wirklich alleine wiederkommt.

Als wir am Bahnhof ankommen, finden wir keinen Tourist
Ticket Counter und kaufen schlussendlich “General Class” Tickets am
Frauenschalter – mit diesen Tickets haben wir keinen Anspruch auf einen
Sitzplatz. Auch der Kauf von Shahid's Ticket gestaltet sich aus unerklaerlichen
Gruenden schwierig und so ist der Zug schon eingefahren, als wir am Bahnsteig
sind. Wir begeben uns sofort in die Sleeper Class und Shahid organisiert noch
eine Bank fuer uns uns brieft einen Mitreisenden, wie er dem Schaffner
erklaeren solle, warum wir da sitzen und dass wir dann einfach die Tickets
upgraden wollen – gegen ein Handgeld von nicht mehr als 150 Rupees…

Dann ist der Moment des Abschieds leider gekommen. Wir
gehen noch einmal mit Shahid auf's Gleis, druecken Ihn und bedanken uns – dann
ist er weg und wir hoffen sehr ihn irgendwann wieder zu sehen…

Als unser Zug kurz spaeter los faehrt ist es schon
komisch, dass er nicht mehr dabei ist. Er wird uns fehlen.

Gut 7 Std. spaeter und ohne irgendwann kontrolliert
worden zu sein kommen wir in Gorakphur an. Ich dachte urspruenglich, wir
wuerden hier schlafen und dann morgen weiter ziehen. Wir versuchen es aber und
landen tatsaechlich noch in einer Bruchbude von Bus, die die 93km nach Sunauli
in schlappen 4 Std. bewaeltigen soll. Somit landen wir dann gegen kurz nach
23:00 Uhr in Grenznaehe und ich mache mir zugegebener massen etwas Sorgen
darum, wo wir denn bleiben, bis am naechsten Morgen die ersten Busse gehen. Ich
bin dann geradezu unausstehlich, als wir durch die Strassen wandeln und dann
den Indischen Grenzposten aus dem Schlaf klopfen, der dieses mit extremer
Unfreundlichkeit quittiert, welches Claudi nicht unkommentiert laesst. Nun sind
wir aus Indien ausgestempelt – kommen wir in Nepal auch an?

Der Grenzuebergang ist in der Tat kein Problem – die
Visa-Stelle hat jedoch bereits zu und so sind wir die Nacht ueber illegal in
Nepal… Zum Glueck scheint das aber nicht weiter ein Problem zu sein. Wir
checken im Hotel ein und genehmigen uns eine Muetze Schlaf. Um 5:30 klingelt morgen
der Wecker…

Happy Holi!
Geo: 25.282, 82.9563

Nach wenigen, aber sehr gut tuenden Stunden Schlaf, zieht
es Claudi als erstes raus ins Getuemmel. Wir hoeren schon seit einiger Zeit,
dass der Teufel los ist und als Claudi kurz nachdem sie das Zimmer verlassen
hatte, komplett nass und voller Farbe zurueck kommt ins Zimmer ist klar, dass
Holi auch bei uns im Hotel Kleider-Opfer fordert. Etwas behaebig ziehen auch
Netti und ich uns alte Klamotten an und es dauert keine 10 Sekunden, die ich
auf der Dachterasse bin, ehe auch ich voller Farbe bin. Auch Shahid hat sich
dazu durchgerungen, Holi dieses Jahr halbwegs mitzumachen. Normaler Weise geht
er als Muslim diesem Hindu Fest aus dem Weg und verbietet allen ihn mit Farben
zu maltretieren. Er bekommt aber auch heute nicht so viel ab.

Bei uns macht sich derweil der Hunger bemerkbar und so
beschliessen wir uns auf die Strasse zu wagen um nach etwas essbarem zu jagen.
Ueberall auf der Strasse werden wir von Daechern mit Farben uebergossen, von
Kindern und Erwachsenen mit Farbe bespritzt mit “Happy Holi” gegruesst – und
von Maennern umarm, und zum Teil auch begrabscht. Sie haben alle getrunken und
kennen nun selbst die minimalen Grenzen auslaendischen Frauen gegenueber nicht
mehr. Shahid geraet so fast in einen handfesten Konflikt, als es einmal
wirklich nicht mehr schoen ist. Indische Maenner
Wir sind erst wenige Minuten wach...
sind wirklich sehr
gewoehnungsbeduerftig und die, die uns tatsaechlich nur die Hand zum Holi Gruss
geben wollen, viel zu wenige…

Gut 1,5 Std. spaeter landen wir unverrichteter Dinge
wieder im Hotel – kein Geschaeft oder Restaurant hatte offen gehabt – bis 12:00
Uhr mittags, wo dann Ende ist mit den Fluessig-Farben, liegt Indien praktisch
brach wie Deutschland am 24.12. abends.

Im Hotel zurueck, nimmt Janette –sehr zum Missfallen
unseres Gastvaters- eine aussgiebige Dusche und etwas spaeter bekommen wir
tatsaechlich etwas zu essen. Das tut gut.

Danach wollen wir uns eigentlich nur einmal kurz hinlegen
– schlafen aber alle 4 sofort tief und fest und wachen erst bei einbrechender Dunkelheit
wieder auf. Shahid hat 2 unbeantwortete Anrufe von meinem Bruder und meiner
Mutter fuer mich und mit meinem Bruder spreche ich dann auch. Schoen!

Als ich fertig bin mit telefonieren machen wir uns auch
wieder auf den Weg um einen Lassi bei dem beruehmten Blue Lassi Mann zu trinken
– angblich der beste Lassi der Stadt.

Es ist ein ganz schoener Marsch dorthin und Netti und ich
fuehlen uns in unseren dreckigen, farb-getraenkten Klamotten recht unwohl –
ganz offensichtlich waescht sich der Inder nach 12:00 und zieht ordentliche
Kleidung an. Die Farben, die abends noch benutzt werden sind Trocken-Farben,
die die Klamotten nicht versauen – wussten wir nicht. Entgegen unseren
Befuerchtungen sind nicht
Noch Fragen?
alle betrunken und so koennen wir recht unbehelligt unseres
Weges gehen. Ausser ein paar Farben ins Gesicht, bekommen wir nichts mehr ab.

Gerade beim Blue Lassi Mann angekommen, erreicht mich
dann auch meine Mutter und es gibt ein kurzes Update von zu Hause. Wunderbar.

Der Lassi haelt dann auch tatsaechlich, was der Lonely Planet
verspricht: soooo lecker! Haette ich nur gewusst, dass es da sogar free WiFi
gibt!!!

Direkt vom Lassi-Mann geht es dann zum Abendessen. Wir
denken die Brown Bread Bakery ist eine gute Idee, werden dann aber bitterlich
enttaescht. Sie haben so gut wie gar nichts da, was sie auf der Karte haben und
so esse ich eine schlechte Pizza, Claudi maessige Pasta und Shahid ein
Sandwich. Netti verzichtet ganz…

Auf dem Rueckweg bekommt Netti dann noch eine komplette
Packung Rot ueber den Kopf geschuettet und ist nun rothaarig – sie kann es zum
Glueck tragen..

Ja, und so geht er dann auch zu Ende, mein Geburtstag
2012. Ich glaube, ich habe noch nie mit so wenig Leuten gesprochen an meinem
Geburtstag – und selten so viele Leute vermisst.

Namaste!

It was bound to happen some time.

After having a migraine 2 days ago I woke up in the middle of the night with a really bad belly ache. Oh dear... I have been confined to my room for most of today. I took one short walk to the market and then turned around to go straight back to my room.

This is all part of the journey through India. I'm feeling very weak and just had a small bowl of brown rice. 😊

I'd love to get some sympathy from someone! 😊

Abschiedsfruehstueck Taj Mahal.
Geo: 25.4482, 78.5674

Ein neuer Tag, ein neues Reiseabenteuer. Von Agra gibt es
leider keinen direkten Zug zu unserem neuen Reiseziel Khajuraho, der Inhaber
der Travel Agency verkauft uns aber nur allzu gern einen Zug nach Jhansi von wo
aus wir todsicher direkt am Bahnhof einen Bus weiter nach Khajuraho nehmen
koennen. Fein, denken wir und sind ueberrascht, als der Zug Agra auch noch
recht puenktlich verlaesst. Wir reisen dieses mal Tagsueber und somit auch
nicht in der Sleeper Klasse, sondern in der normalen Klasse. Als wir unseren
Wagon besteigen und nach unseren Plaetzen Ausschau halten, ist sofort klar,
dass das ein Abenteuer wird. Unsere Plaetze sind natuerlich schon besetzt, aber
Shaid schafft es zumindest, dass wir uns dazu setzen. So sitzt Netti kurz
spaeter auf einer dreier Bank mit 3 weiteren Indern waehrend Claudi, Shaid und
ich mit einem weiteren Inder auf der 3er Bank Platz nehmen. Damit sind wir den
Hundertschaften, die nur stehen schon einmal einen grossen Schritt voraus. Als
dann der Schaffner kommt und die beiden “Fremdsitzer” verscheucht wird es etwas
bequemer, wenngleich ich mit meinem Gang-Platz natuerlich immer wieder Hintern,
Ellenbogen und Taschen im Gesicht habe…

Die Fahrt vergeht dann aber doch halbwegs schnell und wir
kommen um kurz nach zwei in Jhansi an und begeben uns auf die Suche nach dem
Anschlussbus. Wie immer
Ein letzter Blick.
bekommen wir natuerlich tausend Tips und enden
schlussendlich in der Autorikscha eines Fahrers, der uns nun glaubhaft gemacht
hat, dass der Bus vom Busbahnhof faehrt und nicht vom Bahnhof. Als wir wenige
hundert Meter vom Bahnhof weg sind erlaeuetert er dann, dass der letzte Bus
nach Khajuraho leider schon um zwei gefahren ist und will uns nun einen
Auto-Service fuer viel Geld andrehen. Da es wirklich eine horrende Summe ist,
gehen wir darauf nicht ein und wollen in ein Hotel in der Naehe. Der Fahrer
faehrt natuerlich an einigen vorbei und setzt uns dann bei einem ab, wo der
Preis ebenfalls viel zu hoch ist. Da platzt dann Claudi der Kragen und wir
wandern zu Fuss weiter. Wir klappern etliche Hotels in der Stadt ab, aber alle
sagen sie sein voll, obwohl diverse Schluessel am Brett haengen… Nach mehreren
Versuchen spricht Shaid im Vertrauen mit einem Hotel-Besitzer und der erklaert
ihm, dass zwar alle Hotels Zimmer hatten, wir aber als Auslaender kein Zimmer
bekommen wuerden, weil es dann zu Komplikationen mit der Polizei kommen
koennte. Unverrichteter Dinge ziehen wir also weiter und werden im Central
Hotel endlich fuendig. Es ist ein altes, Britisches Hotel und besticht durch
seine Durchschaubarkeit was die Preise angeht und durch seine Buerokratie: so
viele Formulare mussten wir noch nie ausfuellen. Auch Shaid
Netti teilt halt gern...
muss zum ersten mal
selber die Unterlagen ausfuellen und zum ersten mal bekommen wir mit, dass er
wirklich nicht richtig schreiben kann. Er “kopiert” zwar alle Details seines
Ausweises, als er aber bei Nationalitaet “Indian” eintragen soll und ihm dieses
buchstabiert wird bekommt er arge Probleme. Irgendwie unfassbar, dass so ein
cleverer Typ nicht richtig lesen und schreiben kann, aber seine Eltern hatten
eben kein Geld ihn in die Schule zu schicken und so hat er mit 10 richtig
angefangen zu arbeiten.

Gerade in diesem Hotel bekommen wir natuerlich die Frage
gestellt, ob er vertrauenswuerdig sei und ob wir ihn kennen.

Nach der Eincheck-Prozedur gehen wir etwas trinken und
essen und bekommen den bisher besten Lassi der Reise – extra fuer uns
angesetzt. Der Besitzer ist sehr nett und Claudi kommt mit ihm ins Gespraech
und laesst sich noch einige gute Tips geben. Die Fahrt nach Khajuraho mit dem Auto
haette z.B. nur 300 Rupees p.P. kosten duerfen – das haetten wir vielleicht
sogar gemacht.

Wieder im Hotel angekommen schreibe ich noch ein bisschen
am Blog und danach wollen wir im Zimmer gemeinsam einen Film gucken bei dem
Shaid recht schnell einschlaeft, weil er natuerlich nicht sagen mag, dass er
aus seinem Winkel nicht wirklich etwas sieht. Typisch fuer ihn – immer erst
einmal die anderen. Mitten im Film springt
Wir natuerlich auch.
Netti auf einmal auf und rennt zur
Tuer. Der Hotelmanager war ohne anzuklopfen in unser Zimmer gekommen und
fordert uns nun harsch auf, dass Shaid unverzueglich in sein Zimmer zu gehen
habe. Man, man – das sind mal wirklich strenge Regeln des Hotels, die vorher
auch schon meinten eine Strafe aufbrummen zu muessen, weil im (nach oben offenen
Hof) geraucht wurde. Im Zimmer standen Aschenbecher und so wurde das
Rauchverbot nur auf den Rezeptionsbereich bezogen. Hier ist es allerdings so,
dass man nur IM ZIMMER rauchen darf- sonst nirgends. Da soll mal einer drauf
kommen…

Wir schauen den Film dann noch weiter und gehen
irgendwann noch einmal einen Chai trinken und Obst kaufen – ohne Shaid
natuerlich auch zum ueberteuerten Auslaenderpreis.

Ein wenig enttaeuscht von der amerikanischen Version von
Stig Larsson's “Verblendung” fallen wir dann nach ausgiebiger Mueckenjagt und
einem letzten Gang auf die Latrine in einen tiefen, kurzen Schlaf. Morgen frueh
um sechs geht es weiter…

Colorful Saris
Last March, I received a message from an old friend of mine, Philipp. We’d traveled together in South Africa, and again in Costa Rica. This time he was coming to my hometown in California with his girlfriend, Franzi. For two short days, I showed them my old stomping grounds and waxed lyrical about my future travel plans in India – a dream I shared with Franzi. It took us a year, but we both finally made it, Franzi preceding me by a month. By the time I arrived, she had already planned a weekend trip for us to Agra, a small city with a huge monument: the Taj Mahal.

Franzi told me that she’d booked seats for us in a sleeper car. I liked the sound of that. But if an Indian sleeper car isn’t a misnomer, I don’t know what is. There was definitely no space for sleeping. There was hardly any space for sitting. It was a typical Indian experience for a foreigner. The cramped space, the stuffy air, the black mice scampering to and fro, and, of course, the men who seemed to come from the entire length of the train just to stop and stare. Five
Sleeper Cabin
minutes from our destination, the train stopped dead and didn’t budge for half an hour. When was this ride going to be over?

Tired and aggravated, we arrived in Agra. A man in a sparkly black shirt greeted us at our cabin and followed us through the station, incessantly pushing his services. We told him several times that we didn’t need his help. He’d disappear, then reappear again a few moments later with the same offers. Our tempers broke simultaneously. We yelled in unison, “WE DON’T NEED YOUR HELP!” He muttered something and walked away. Franzi asked me, “What did he say?” “I don’t know,” I replied, “I heard, ‘I am a vegetable.’” We laughed hysterically, the situation diffused. Hearing our laughter, Shiny Vegetable, as we started to call him, turned around and redoubled his efforts. “Okay. 50 rupees. You come now. This way please.” We found another ride to our hotel.

Our small room was next to a common area, but even with the noise right outside our door, we quickly fell asleep. A few hours later, we woke up scratching itches that covered us from head to toe. Bed bugs. I put on another layer of
Beauty and the Building
clothes and somehow managed to fall asleep again. We were awoken again a few hours later, this time to the sound of a bag crinkling. A mouse had gotten into our stash of peanuts and was happily munching away. We’d hardly gotten back to sleep when the alarm started ringing. We dragged our tired eyes up to the rooftop and sat under the dark, pre-dawn sky, listening to nasal, off-key muezzins and looking at the black silhouette of the Taj Mahal in front of us. Three langur monkeys climbed out of the trashcan they were raiding and took a seat in front of us to share the view.

We left for the ticket gate and got there thirty minutes before it opened. The line had already snaked its way along the metal dividers. When we finally made it to the security gate we were told to leave behind all of our food, which we had plenty of. We’d heard stories about local restaurants poisoning foreigners and getting a cut of the thousands of rupees they shelled out to get better. As such, we didn’t want to leave our day’s sustenance behind. I claimed I was hypoglycemic (forgive my white
Waiting to Enter
lie) and that I needed to have food with me at all times. “Okay,” the guard said, “But you can’t take fruit. Please take these chocolates.” Now, there’s a thought. Natural foods that leave no waste aren’t allowed, but processed things that make a mess are? Oh, India. I’ve only just arrived and already you make no sense to me. We stuffed our face with fruit, took the proffered bars and entered through the South Gate to face a scene seen countless times in movies and on travel posters. Nothing compares to seeing it in real life. With the light of the rising sun softly kissing the white marble it looked perfect, and ineffable.

For three hours, we slowly strolled through the manicured grounds, stopping every so often to marvel at the magnificence of the marble monument. As the sun rose higher, the marble glowed brighter, until the glare became strong enough to cause a headache. We sought refuge in the main mausoleum. Inside, it was dim and cool. A funky smell pervaded the air. In the center of the room were two tombs, tiny in the majesty of their surroundings. Suddenly, I remembered what the Taj Mahal is
Ceiling of the Mosque
all about. It’s a love story – one grief-stricken man’s way of commemorating the death of his beautiful wife. Almost 500 years later, millions of people still find his monument of love worth the trouble to visit. It’s very touching – even if I would never want to be immortalized in this way. If you’ll forgive the morbidity, I’ll share that I want to be composted and used to grow a tree.

Tired from the disturbances of the night, the early morning wake up call and the walk through the heat, we followed the lead of a starving dog and laid down in the shade of one of the lawn’s many shrubs to take a nap. I woke up to the sound of laughter – we’d attracted quite a crowd. I rolled over to better ignore their chuckles and again saw the brilliant white façade in front of me. My life is unbelievably blessed. It was a good moment to keep in mind when the journey back began fraying my nerve ends.

Taj Mahal
Hello everyone,

Agra is called the city of monuments, including the famous Taj Mahal. The first monument we visited is Akbar’s Tomb, the second is called Baby Taj and was built a few years before the main attraction. It is also called the Jewellery Box. All the monuments have a few things in common: they were built by the Mughals who controlled India for three hundred years between the 1500s and 1800s. We use the term mogul to describe someone successful, and that is the Indian context as well. Each person for whom the monument was built is buried several feet beneath the monument, with their feet facing south, their head facing north and their head turned to face west toward Mecca—remember Mecca is east of North America, but west of India.

The Taj Mahal is breathtaking. It was built in between 1632 to 1649 and employed 20,000 labourers. Our guide pointed out that it is the only monument in the world built for love—others celebrate glory. It was built by Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died delivering her fourteenth child at age thirty-nine. The structure is clad in translucent marble so
Akbar's Tomb
it appears pink in the morning, white in full sunlight, a cream colour in the evening, and blue under a full moon. The thickness of the marble varies from three inches to three feet—all 150,000 tones of the stuff. Although you can see light through this kind of marble, it is incredibly hard and non-porous. The structure has never been washed—the monsoons do a good enough job of keeping it clean. Much of the inside is decorated with marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Some of the pieces are the size of a finger nail clipping. The glue to hold the tiny pieces in place has held for 350 years. The formula for the glue is an absolute secret. The pictures are of the front of the structure, but all four sides are identical! It is symmetrical right down to the size of the gardens that surround it on all four sides. Also, it has four gate houses to add to the symmetry. The minarets are for looks only and to make the monument look even more impressive, not to call the faithful to prayer--the usual purpose of minarets. I wasn't prepared for the size of this structure--forty-three storeys, not metres,
Akbar's Tomb
Even the gate house is impressive
but storeys high. They are very picky about what you can bring into the property: no pens, pencils, gum, etc. Basically anything that could mar the surface. Along with photos, I bought a tacky souvenir from a street urchin. A key chain that is a Taj Mahal snow cone. Snow in India? Go figure.

The other big attraction is Agra Fort, also called The Red Fort. It is actually a fortified palace. Hard to break into this place—the wall is 1-1/2 miles long and 69 feet high. The outer water moat had alligators, and the inner dry moat housed lions and tigers.

All in all, a pretty cool city.

Everywhere you look you see water buffalo—even in Delhi in the middle of busy business areas. 80% of the milk in India comes from water buffalo, and they also provide meat. If a restaurant offers a beef dish, it is water buffalo and not beef. Cows are protected in India. It reflects the influence of the vegetarian Buddhists, but then the Hindus are also vegetarians. This is more of a custom than a religious thing. The water buffalo are used for something else, but you’ll have to look
Gazelles
A high wall protects the 123 acre property along with the gazelles and a number of monkeys. They are descendants of the originals from 350 years ago!
at the pictures. We had a free evening, so a bunch of us went to the local McDonald’s—I wanted to see if they served water buffalo burgers. No luck there, they have chicken burgers, fish burgers and veggie burgers. Here’s the good news—my chicken burger, fries and soft drink cost me $1.50. An ice cream cone sold for 20 cents!

Namaste!

Donna

Foto des Tages!
Geo: 26.9847, 78.1019

Morgens gegen 06:00 Uhr kommen wir mit nur einer Stunde
Verspaetung in Agra an. Vorher singen wir Claudi, sehr zur Ueberraschung aller
Mitreisenden, natuerlich im Zug noch ein Geburtstagsstaendchen, ueberreichen
ihr das kleine Geburtstagsgeschenk und zuenden eine Kerze an.

Was vor Claudi liegt ist ja auch kein gewoehnlicher
Geburtstag – wer “feiert” schon am Taj Mahal?

Als uns die vollgestopfte Motorrad-Rikscha am Hotel
absetzt wollen wir eigentlich gleich zum Taj Mahal, aber als wir die
Dachterasse unseres Hotels erklimmen, haben wir einen grossartigen Blick auf
den Taj Mahal und entscheiden uns dieses Anblick erst einmal beim Fruehstueck
zu geniessen.

Nach dem Essen geht es dann los. Wir wissen, dass der Taj
Mahal mit fuer uns 750 Rupees Eintritt (Shaid musste nur 20 Rupees bezahlen)
teuer ist, aber lasst Euch sagen: er ist jede Rupee wert!

Als wir vor dem Eingangsbogen stehen und der Taj Mahal
dahinter im Morgenlicht ins Blickfeld kommt bin ich wirklich ueberwaeltigt und
mir steigen die Traenen in die Augen. Anders als Angkor Wat ist der Taj Mahal
nicht einfach eindrucksvoll und magisch, er ist irgenwie wirklich so
romantisch, wie es immer gesagt wird. Das blasse Weiss, die vielen Details und
das Gebaeude an sich sind atemberaubend. Je naeher wir dem Taj Mahal kommen,
desto mehr Details sieht man. Der erste Blick durch das Eingangstor wird
Der erste Blick auf den Taj - von der Terasse
aber
immer mein Liebster sein.

Im Taj Mahal selbst sieht man dann auch die letzten
Details: die tausenden von Blumen aus Edelsteinen, die Details im Marmor.
Einfach grossartig. Auch die beiden Moscheen rechts und links vom Taj Mahal
sind grossartig und machen das Gesamtbild natuerlich mit aus.

Ich bin noch immer total beeindruckt von dem Besuch.
Dieses Erlebnis war wirklich grossartig.

Direkt vom Taj Mahal lassen wir uns dann zum Agra Fort
bringen. Eine alte Festung in der der Mogul mit seinen unzahligen Frauen und
Angestellten gelebt hat. Auch dieses ist ein grossartiger Anblick und wahrhaft
gross. Ein wenig kann man sich noch vorstellen, wie es hier zu Zeiten des
Moguls zugegangen sein muss. Zudem hat man von allen Terassen einen schoenen
Blick auf den Fluss und den in der Ferne herausragenden Taj Mahal.

Wie fast ueberall in Indien, sind auch hier viele Affen
unterwegs und Netti macht dann leider auch eine unangenehme Erfahrung mit
einem, der ihr auf einmal in den Arm beisst. Zum Glueck war es am Ende eher ein
Kneifen als ein Biss und so gibt es auch keine Wunde, die sich entzuenden
koennte. Glueck im Unglueck also.

Geplaettet von all den Eindruecken und natuerlich auch
ein wenig dem vielen Laufen, kommen wir am Nachmittag wieder im Hotel an und
gehen etwas essen und nutzen ein wenig das
Tor zum Taj Mahal Gelaende
Internet. All diese Berichte hier
wollen ja auch eingestellt werden… Leider traegt das Sitzen am Computer nicht
unbedingt der Ausgeruhtheit bei und so muss ich mich schwer zusammenreissen um
nicht wie Netti direkt nach der Dusche einzuschlafen. Claudi und Shaid gucken
derweil Bollywood Filme in Shaid's Zimmer.

Als wir um Neun essen gehen sind wir alle platt und wenig
gespraechig. Es war ein aufregender Tag!

Geo: 25.282, 82.9563

Unser vorerst letzter Tag in Varanasi beginnt mit einem
ausgiebigen Fruehstueck in der German Bakery. Dann machen wir uns auf den Weg
zur Travel Agency bei der wir gestern unser Zugtickets nach Agra gebucht haben
um diese einzusammeln. Wir schlendern durch die engen Gassen und besuchen den
Goldenen Tempel, der mit extremen Sicherheitsbestimmungen aufwartet bei denen
man erst einmal alles abgeben muss, dann durch einen Metalldetektor gefuehrt
wird und dann noch einmal einer Leibesvisite vom Feinsten unterzogen wird. Wer
dann denkt, damit waere man schon im Tempel, irrt gewaltig. Nun muss man sich
noch einmal mit allen Details seines Passes in eine Liste eintragen und zu
guter Letzt die Schuhe ausziehen. Was wir dann zu sehen bekommen ist fuer
unsere verwoehnten “Reisenden-Augen” dann eher unteres Mittelmass – leider
schaffen es die Inder nicht ihre Schoenheiten zu pflegen und zu bewahren. Das
ist in ganz Varanasi etwas, was wirklich schade ist: Instandhaltung ist ein
Fremdwort und so wird es viele schoene Bauten wohl nicht mehr lange geben. Nach
der Tempelbesichtigung machen wir noch einmal einen Abstecher zu dem Laden von
Geschaeftspartnern von Shaid bei denen wir schon gestern ein paar Hemden zum
Einkaufspreis gekauft haben und legen heute mit Hosen nach. Der Inhaber des
Ladens ist ein gestandener Geschaeftsmann, der in ganz Indien seine Ware
vertreibt und uns von seinen 60 Maschinen erzaehlt die er hat und in den
naechsten Monaten noch einmal um 50 weitere ausbauen will. Wir sind beeindruckt
und sagen, dass wir die “Fabrik” gerne einmal sehen wuerden. Da diese aber gut
40KM entfernt ist, ist das natuerlich nicht moeglich, er habe aber auch 7
Maschinen hier in Varanasi, gleich um die Ecke, da koennen wir gern einmal
hereinschauen. Interessiert wie wir sind, machen wir und mit Shaid auf den Weg
dahin und staunen nicht schlecht, als in der engen Gasse eine Tuer aufgemacht
wird und in einem Raum, der kleiner ist als unser Wohnzimmer, 7 Naehmaschienen
stehen an denen 7 Maenner arbeiten. Irgendwie hatten wir uns das Imperium ein
wenig groesser vorgestellt. Die Fabrik, wo er 60 Maschinen stehen hat, sei aber
deutlich groesser, wird uns versichert…

Gegen 15:15 Uhr muessen wir uns dann auf den Weg zum
Bahnhof machen – unser Zug soll um 16:45 Uhr fahren. Soll… Wir stehen natuerlich
weit ueber eine Stunde auf dem Gleis, zusammen mit Kuehen, Kindern, Muell und
allem, was man sich bei uns nicht vorstellen kann. Die Kuehe stehen auf den
Gleisen, durchsuchen den Muell oder treiben einfach mal die Menschentrauben
auseinander.

Als unser Zug dann endlich auf einem nicht angekuendigten
Gleis einfaehrt sind wir froh, dass wir einen Tip bekommen dass dem so ist.
Soetwas kann auch daneben gehen. Im Zug spielen wir eine ganze Weile Karten und
schnacken – wie angenehm es doch ist mit Shaid einen Inder an unserer Seite zu
haben. Der andere Inder in unserer Naehe macht uns hingegen wenig Freude: er
rotzt und ruelpst und furzt in einer Tour. Uber einige deutsche Sitten kann man
wirklich nur gluecklich sein.

Zu unserem Glueck haben wir 2 Betten ganz oben und 2 in
der Mitte bekommen – viel besser als die ganz unten… Ich schlafe schon Frueh in
meinem Bett ganz oben ein und wache erst um 01:00Uhr wieder auf. Danach faellt
das schlafen etwas schwer, dieses mal nicht ob der Kaelte, sondern weil der
Magen kneift und wir zudem den Wagon direkt hinter der Lok haben, die
ununterbrochen hupt und dass dann auch mal so, dass man sich sicher ist, dass
man gleich frontal in einen entgegenkommenden Zug kracht, die mitunter unter
lautem Getoese an einem vorbei brettern.

Hey everyone!

Just a short message to say that I am safe and well. The yoga festival has just started today and as you can imagine there are so many things to do. (Laura, it is like Woodford) I looked at the program and there is something on every second of the day. I will try and find time to write a proper entry in a few day time.

I am having the most magical time here. I am soaking up the knowledge that everyone has to offer. I'm learning so much and it just makes me realise how much more I want to know about life!!!

I have had some life changing experiences the last week and am ready for whatever comes my way. Practicing yoga and meditation 2 times a day and this still doesn't feel like enough. I have mastered some new yoga asanas (postures) and I am loving the way my body and mind are feeling. This is a very special place.

Got to run

Love to you all

Joanna 😊

Sonnenaufgang in Varanasi.
Geo: 25.282, 82.9563

Um 5:30 Uhr klingelt der Wecker und um 6:00 Uhr versuchen
wir durch Klopfen an der Tuer und Rufen auch Shaid aufzuwecken. Keine Chance!
Der gute Junge hat einen gesunden Schlaf. So hinterlassen wir dann nur einen
Zettel und machen uns auf in Richtung Ganges. Wenige minuten spaeter sitzen wir
in einem Ruderboot und sehen die Sonne ueber dem Fluss aufgehen. Es herrscht
bereits reges Treiben: es wird Waesche im Fluss gewaschen (und dann spaeter am
Ufer in den Dreck gelegt zum Trocknen), es wird Koerperpflege (?) betrieben und
es werden Leichen verbrannt. Es ist wirklich alles irgendwie anders in Indien.
Die Bootstour ist interessant und die Stadt sieht toll aus im fruehen
Morgenlicht, es ist aber auch noch sehr kuehl. Als wir gut 1,5 Std. spaeter
durch sind mit unserer Tour denken wir Shaid im Hotel anzufinden, aber der hat
sich laengst auf die Suche nach uns gemacht uns aber verpasst. Als er einige
Zeit spaeter wieder im Hotel eintrifft haengt unser Magen (der sich eh schon
viel zu sehr an reichhaltiges, indisches Essen gewoehnt hat) auf halb acht und
wir begeben uns auf die Suche nach einem Fruehstueckslokal. Den Rest des Tages
vertroedeln wir in der Stadt und an den Ghats des Ganges.

Zum Abendessen haben wir uns im Hotel angemeldet, denn am
Vorabend
Die Strassen von Varanasi im Morgenlicht.
hat unser Guesthouse Besitzer gekocht und es roch umwerfend. Reichlich
spaet faengt er dann auch mit dem Kochen an – assistiert von Claudi. Leider
gibt es aber zu der Zeit keinen Strom und so dauert es lange ehe wir endlich
auf der Dachterasse sitzen und bei Kerzenschein das fantastische Essen
geniessen. Das Kochen hat der gute Gastvater wirklich drauf und auch die
Gesellschaft von ihm beim Essen ist eine Bereicherung, denn er hat wirklich so
einige lustige Stories auf Lager. Schwer vom Essen und dem Bier das wir dazu
hatten fallen wir gegen Mitternacht alle in den Schlaf.

Taj Mahal Sunset
Dienstag ist unser erster Tag ""on the road"" mit Harish und unserem kleinen schnuckeligen Ambassador, einem Auto das aussieht wie aus den 50ern - aber erst 2004 gebaut wurde. Sehr bequem ist er, was uns darüber hinwegsehen lässt, dass es keine Gurte gibt und die gebuchte ""Aircondition"" darin besteht, dass man alle Fenster öffnet.
Wir brauchen etwa 30 Minuten zu Bangalis Haus in einem Vorort, der etwas wohlhabender zu sein scheint. Dennoch bin ich etwas geschockt, als uns Anita ins Haus bittet, die kleine Familie, Bangali, Anita und ihre 10jährige Tochter wohnen in einem Raum mit einer Mini-Küche von etwa 4 qm und einem indischen (Stehklo-) Bad.
So bescheiden wohnt man also als Inhaber einer Fahreragentur? Bangali hatte uns gestern noch erzählt, wie er sich letztes Jahr selbstständig gemacht hatte- mithilfe eines Geldgebers aus der Schweiz, eines ehemailigen Fahrgastes, hat er sich zunächst ein eigenes Auto finanziert und dann auch einige fremde Fahrer mit eigenen Fahrzeugen quasi als Subunternehmer angestellt. Der junge Mann aus der Schweiz hat ihm auch die Homepage gebastelt über die wir ihn gebucht haben.
Natürlich ist Bangali noch nicht lange im Geschäft, aber dennoch kann ich mir garnicht vorstellen zu dritt in einem so kleinen Raum zu
Taj Mahal bei Sunset
leben und zu schlafen- vorallem da das- von uns während des Besuches als Sitzgelegenheit genutzte Bett höchstens 1,20 m breit ist.
Anita serviert uns würzigen Chai-Tee und leckere, sehr knusprige und scharfe Teigfladen, die sie glaube ich Papad genannt hat.
Dann besprechen wir unsere Tour nocheinmal kurz und zahlen etwa 1/3 der Kosten an. Auf dem Rückweg sind wir noch einmal bei Anita zum Lunch eingeladen und lernen hoffentlich auch die kleine Tochter mal kennen.
Dann dauert es etwa eineinhalb Stunden bis wir entgültig aus dem gräßlichen, ewig hupenden Verkehr rund um den Großraum Delhi heraus sind und Harish mal über 40 km/h beschleunigen kann. Draussen zieht das indische Leben an uns vorbei: Straßenmärkte, Müllberge, wunderschön bunt gekleidete Frauen und spielende Kinder sowie Esel, Kühe, Ziegen, Hunde und Affen laufen herum. Immer wieder tuckern voll besetzte kleine Autorikschas an uns vorbei, die höchste Personenzahl pro Rikscha die wir zählen, sind 14 Personen von denen zwei auf dem Dach sitzen!! Auch die Fahrräder mit Anhänger sind teilweise halsbrecherisch beladen mit allem was so transportiert werden muss: von 10 Meter langen Aluminiumlatten zu, in einer Art Käfig-Anhänger transportierten, Grundschulkindern, von haushoch getürmten Ziegelsteinen bis zu riesigen Pflanzenbündeln.
Die kleinen Orte an denen
Mehr Taj Mahal bei Sunset
wir vorbeifahren sehen alle irgendwie gleich aus, meist ärmlich, gesichtslos und zugemüllt aber überall tobt das Leben auf der Straße.

Dann kommen wir nach etwa 4 1/2 Stunden Fahrt endlich in Agra an. Wie uns bereits der Reiseführer prophezeite, ist die Stadt ein schreckliches Moloch, das außer dem Taj Mahal und einem Roten Fort, ähnlich dem in Delhi, nicht viel zu bieten hat.
Wir beziehen ein kleines, aber sauberes Hotelzimmer (aus Prinzip erstmal nicht das was uns Harish vorschlagen wollte) für 800 Rupien, also etwa 13 Euro und fahren dann am Roten Fort vorbei zunächst auf die andere Flussseite des Taj Mahal, um es dort von einem netten kleinen Park aus im Abendlicht zu bestaunen.
In dem Park ist es auf Grund eines geringfügigen Eintrittsgeldes auch relativ ruhig und so sitzen wir über 2 Stunden einfach nur dort herum und bestaunen dieses monumentale Wunderwerk der Baukunst bis die Sonne untergeht und wir von einem Aufseher mit einer extrem nervigen Trillerpfeife als letzte Gäste aus dem Park gescheucht werden.

Zum Abendessen nehmen wir eine Empfehlung von Harish an und essen super lecker auf der Dachterasse eines kleinen Hotels. Hier fühlen sich allerdings im Gegensatz zu Delhi auch kleine Stechmücken
Taj Mahal Sunrise
sehr wohl und da der Bundesstaat Uttar Pradesh, in dem wir uns jetzt befinden ein bedeutend höheres Malariarisiko hat als Rajastan und Delhi werfen wir uns vorsichtshalber unser Allround Antibiotikum ein.


""Schließ dich dem Kreis meiner Diener an und gehe in mein Paradies ein"" (Vers 89 des Koran, Inschrift auf dem Eingangstor zum Taj Mahal)


Unser Wecker klingelt um 05:45 Uhr um den Sonnenaufgang beim Taj Mahal zu sehen...Aber eigentlich hätten wir ihn garnicht gebraucht, denn gegenüber ist ja eine Moschee und der Muezzin weckt uns netterweise schon um 05.30 Uhr und zwar so laut als würde er mir ins Ohr singen. Nagut, aufstehen und in Trance in Richtung Ticketschalter torkeln, Ticket kaufen (bei einem 12 Euro Ticket gibt es eine Gratis Flasche Wasser dazu, wie nett...denn sein eigenes Essen und Trinken darf man nicht mitnehmen). Dann fahren wir mit einem -ebenfalls kostenlosen- Elektrobus bis kurz vor das Osttor des Taj Mahal und warten dort artig mit etwa 30 weiteren Frühaufstehern bis die Sonne und damit die Tore zum Taj Mahal aufgehen.
Nach dem bereits bekannten Ritual der Ganzkörperuntersuchung findet die Securitydame 3 Lollipops in meiner Tasche, die natürlich sofort sichergestellt werden- ""man darf doch kein
keiner da außer uns...
Essen mitbringen Miss""!!
Den Verlust verkraften wir jedoch ganz schnell, als wir durch das Haupttor den ersten weltberühmten Blick auf das Taj Mahal im Morgenlicht mit seinen Wasserbecken und Gartenanlagen werfen können. Wunderschön.
Und so genießen wir die wenigen ruhigen Minuten in denen wir fast ganz alleine auf das Taj Mahal zulaufen, denn die meisten Touristen bleiben erstmal am Haupttor stehen um von dort tausende Bilder zu machen.
Auch wenn man das Taj Mahal schon von etlichen Bildern kennt, verzaubert das Original uns total.
Natürlich machen auch wir von jedem Zentimeter des Gebäudes ein Foto und laufen die gesamte Gartenanlage ab, um von jedem Standpunkt den Blick auf dieses Wunderwerk der Architektur und der Liebe aufzusaugen.
Insgesamt fast 3 Stunden bleiben wir in der Anlage, die sich nach und nach mit immer mehr Touristen füllt bis man schließlich fast nirgends mehr alleine sein kann und auch wir uns irgendwann satt gesehen haben.

Dann machen wir uns nach einem kurzen Frühstück auf in den Ranthambore Nationalpark, laut Harish etwa 5-6 Stunden Fahrt.
Harish erzählt heute zum ersten Mal sehr offen und von sich aus über die Korruption von Politik und Polizei in Indien, eigentlich so ein Thema, das man als
... Taj Mahal...
Tourist nicht von sich aus anspricht, insofern waren wir genauso interessiert wie überrascht und schockiert darüber, was er uns da freimütig erzählt hat. Kein Wunder, dass es immernoch so vielen Leuten hier so schlecht geht und das Land in Müll und Armut erstickt. Rajasthan ist trotz der vielen Kulturellen Highlights und Touristen einer der ärmsten und am wenigsten alphabetisierten Staaten Indiens. Leider ist es wahrscheinlich auch die Größe dieses Landes, die es so schwer macht, diese Umstände grundlegend zu ändern.

Um die lange Autofahrt etwas aufzulockern machen wir einen kleinen Zwischenstop in Fatehpur Sikri einer Geisterstadt mit Moschee und Palastanlage etwa 40 km von Agra entfernt. Hier werden wir aber nur von Bettlern, Verkäufern, ""Guides"", Schleppern belagert, sodass der Aufenthalt sehr anstrengend ist. Vorallem sind hier so viele Kinder, die Sachen verkaufen wollen, was wir immer sehr traurig finden.
Wir sehen uns nur die Moschee an und fahren nach etwa 45 Minuten weiter.

Unsere Fahrt führt uns dann durch die inzwischen relativ grüne Landschaft aus Uttar Pradesh endlich nach Rajasthan, ""The Royal Land of Kings"" wie einige Prospekte es immer so schön beschreiben.
Wir versuchen ein bisschen zu schlafen was aber auf Grund der immer schlechter werdenden Straßen,
mehr Taj Mahal
teilweise Sand- und Schotterpisten nur schwer möglich ist. Teilweise kann Harish kilometerlang nur 20 km/h fahren und so bleibt zwar viel Zeit sich das Dorfleben, das am Autofenster vorbeizieht, anzusehen aber die Fahrt dauert letztendlich 7 1/2 Stunden. Offenbar hatte Harish eine neue Strecke ausprobiert, die aus meiner Sicht aber eindeutig durchgefallen ist.

Gegen Abend kommen wir in Sawai Madhopur am Rande des Nationalparks an. Da wir sher müde sind checken wir in dem von Harish vorgeschlagenen Ankur Resort ein und buchen auch hier an der Rezeption eine- etwas teurere- Tigersafari für morgen früh.
Im Ranthambore Nationalpark gibt es noch 20 Tiger, mal sehen ob wir einen zu sehen kriegen.

Sleeper Class in Indien - ein Abenteuer
Geo: 25.282, 82.9563

Die Zugfahrt verlangt uns einiges ab. In der Nacht wird es bitterkalt und waehrend Claudi seelenruhig schlaeft, tun Netti und ich kaum ein Auge zu. Die Kaelte, kombiniert mit einem gewissen Unwohlsein inmitten indischer Maenner, die einen die Stunden zuvor so gemustert haben ist ein gewoehnungsbeduerftiger Cocktail. Als wir in den Morgenstunden unsere Herumliegerei beenden, geht es uns schon deutlich besser und es wird auch langsam warmer. So geniessen wir den Ausblick aus dem Zug – es ist wirklich eine andere Welt. Bereits 20 Minuten bevor unser Zug in Varanasi sein soll, kommen wir im Randgebiet an und koennen es kaum fassen, dass der Zug zu frueh dran ist, statt zu spaet. Aber Indien waere nicht Indien, wenn wir nicht doch noch gut 1 Std. stehen wuerden und somit dann auch doch zu spaet ankommen. Als naechstes dann das gewohnte Bild: wir kommen an und wollen uns clever an den pre-paid Taxi Schalter begeben um nicht abgezockt zu werden. Soweit geht das auch gut, aber dann machen sie da trotzdem Macken uns in einen anderen Stadtteil bringen zu wollen, weil nur die Motorradrikschas durch die kleinen Gassen kommen. Gut – dann nehmen wir eben eine Motorradrikscha… Diese faehrt uns
Gitter vor den Fenstern.
natuerlich nicht da hin, wo wir hin wollen und laesst uns ein Hotel ansehen, gegen welches wir uns dann auch entscheiden. Dann kommen wir (angeblich) bei dem von uns geforderten Vishnu Rest House an. Claudi kommt es noch etwas komisch vor, weil sie meint es muesste eigentlich an einem anderen Ghat sein, aber der Name stimmt, der Leiter des Ladens ist nett und die Zimmer okay – also checken wir ein.

Spaeter stellt sich heraus, dass wir natuerlich wirklich nicht im Vishnu Rest House gelandet sind, sondern im Vishnu r-esthouse – so geschrieben, dass kein Unterschied zu erkennen ist. Ja, hier sind alle Mittel recht.

Recht geplaettet von der kurzen Nacht, lassen wir es ruhig angehen, zudem hat Shaid jede 30 Minuten noch eine Std. mehr Verspaetung und wir wissen nicht, wann er eintrifft. So erkunden wir nur die naeheste Umgebung. Was wir sehen gefaellt uns. Varanasi ist definitiv schoener als Kalkutta und durch die engen Gassen auch sehr viel beschaulicher.

Wir erkunden die ersten Ghats, werden Zeuge der ersten Bestattungen und saugen das Treiben am Ganges in uns ein.

Um 18:00 Uhr hat es dann auch Shaid zu uns geschafft und wir gehen gemeinsam noch etwas essen, bevor es uns alle ins Bett
Ausserhalb der Stadt.
verschlaegt. Morgen frueh um halb sechs klingelt der Wecker denn wir wollen eine Sonnenaufgangs Bootstour auf dem Ganges machen. Namaste!

Delhi Traffic
India a country of many contrasts and much history. It is a country that is a shock to your senses and at times polar opposites, poverty/wealth - filth/spotless - drab/colorful - quiet/loud - caring/ruthless.


We arrived in New Delhi after a 14 hour flight from Chicago, which was not as bad as you might think and Air India was very accommodating and it helped that the plane had 100 empty seats so we could spread out and get some sleep.


Our first experience with Delhi traffic was an eye opening experience and you instantly knew you never wanted to drive any motorized vehicle in this country. The roads are crammed with every imaginable variety of transportation from 4 legged to 2 wheels. It is survival of the fittest and the biggest vehicle always has the right of way, unless a tuk tuk, bicycle or motorcycle can slip in between you and the next mode of transportation. Then there is the ever present cow that will be munching or laying on any available strip of land.
Hotel was very comfortable and the shower was not lacking in pressure or hot water which made the nights sleep very welcoming.
Tilting Bus in Delhi Traffic


Our first day was to visit the Red Fort, the Birla Hindu temple a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, the hand carved Kutab Minar, Jamma Masjid Mosque, India largest, and the India Gate in old Delhi. The history of the country was told to us by our very informed guide and the names all run together but his love and pride of his beloved India came thru in every tale of the countries history.


Day 2 was a long bus ride to the Pink City of Jaipur and upon arrival we were welcomed by decorated elephants in the road way. Seeing the Amber Fort basked in the setting sun made the long trip worthwhile. The next morning we returned to the Amber Fort to find our personal beast of burden the Indian Elephant waiting to take us up the hill to the entrance gate of the fort. The best part of the ride apart from the spectacular view of the valley was the respite it allowed us from the ever present street hawkers selling us every imaginable kind of trinket as a souvenir of our visit. The reason this is called the pink city is because of the
India Gate in Delhi
red sandstone that is used to construct the palace and the fort that protects the palace. The enormous size of this structure amazes you and your imagination cannot conceive of how they built such a structure and its surrounding wall in the 1300-1400‘s.


Well we said good bye to Jaipur and took another day long bus ride to Agra the home of India’s most famous tourist attraction, The Taj Mahal. We spent the next morning at the Taj and I believe it to be one of the most beautiful stone buildings I have ever seen. It is all white marble and the flower designs are precious stones that are inlaid in the marble. During the construction of this mausoleum there were 20,000 workman on site every day. The Taj Mahal was built by the king for a resting place for his wife who died during the childbirth of their 13th child in the 17th year of their marriage. This was the kings 3rd wife but his favorite and after her death he built the Taj as her resting place and then upon his death he too was placed next to her. During this time in India rulers were
Minaret
Muslim and believed in burial as opposed to the current rulers who are predominately Hindu and cremation is their religious belief.


Driving from Agra to Khajuraho is a hair raising experience. Narrow roads, every imaginable form of traffic the scariest which are the local full size busses that travel fast with very loud horns and 2 people to every seat. One foot of space to miss the opposing traffic or pedestrian is more than adequate. In route we visited the ancient ruins of the Maharajah palace in Ochara which while beautiful but was in need of restoration but the local village people were interesting and gave us another insight to life in India. This was a very long day but upon arrival at our destination a village of 15,000 people it was refreshing to be without the hordes of people and traffic.

Khajuraho is home to the Kama Sutra temples built in the 9th century and discovered by an English explorer in the early 1800’s. It is not the subject matter of the temples that wows you but the detail of the stone sculpture and the intricacies and the sheer size of the temples in pristine grounds.
Minaret in Delhi and Mosque
Our guide an expert in erotocology was very entertaining and kept us laughing all day. Our second day was very leisurely in that we could sleep in and rest before our noon flight to Varanassi and the 24 hour cremation site on the Ganges river.


Arriving in Varnassi we were back to the mass of humanity that we had come to know since our arrival. Varanassi is home to the Mother Ganja, Ganges river and the most holy of places for a Hindu to be cremated and perhaps find Nirvana. Arriving in the afternoon afforded us the opportunity to visit the Ghats (gots), steps leading to the river, for the evening prayers performed by 7 Hindu priests simultaneously on the Ghats. We boarded a wooden boat , propelled thru the waters by 2 able body Indians with homemade bamboo oars. We went downriver to the one of the 2 cremation Ghats on the river and witnessed no less than 10 fires burning. It is a fascinating ritual and one that is hard to describe, the visuals, smells, and sounds are unique to this location. It is a beautiful and repulsive sight all at the same time, however it
Carvings on temple supports
is the culmination of a Hindu believer's life. The next morning we returned to the Ghats to witness not only the preparation for that days cremations but also the faithful who come to the Holy Ganges to bathe in the morning. The other activity on the Ghats next to the bather is the washer woman who is doing the daily laundry. Again we were propelled in wooden boats to watch the sunrise over the Ganges.


Saying farewell to Varanassi we made our way to the rooftop of the world and the gateway to the Himalayas, Katmandu Nepal. The first thing you notice are the paved roads, curbs and sidewalks and someone actually picks up the trash that is piled in the gutter. We are here for 3 days and everyone is looking forward to seeing the Himalayas. The Katmandu valley is made up of 3 cities, Katmandu, Pataan, Bhopatku. The hub of the city is the Hindu temples built in the center of each city in the 10th century and the buildings are a stunning cross of Chinese and Nepalese architecture. We viewed the main Hindu and Buddhist temple the first morning and the an adventures ride into
Minaret Carvings
the country side rising from 4,500 feet elevation of the valley floor to 6,200 feet of the ridges around the city. This ascent in our bus was on a one lane two way road with steep drop offs and not for the faint of heart driver. We were successful and at the top were rewarded with our first great views of the Himalayas and of course tea. While descending to the valley we stopped to visit a typical farm valley and see the rural way of life.


The second morning was the highlight of the trip, a one hour flight to view the Himalaya mountain range and Mt. Everest at 29,000+ feet in elevation. We took off with a small cloud cover and after passing 10,000 feet we were greeted with blue sky and sunshine, a postcard perfect day and smooth ride. You just don’t get tired of viewing the mountains and it was spectacular. We finished up the day in a converted Nepalese mansion that served us a traditional dinner and entertainment.

We said goodbye to our other 29 fellow travelers and now we are off on our own to visit Thailand and Cambodia.

Perfect Reflection of the Taj Mahal
It was only the steep staircases of China’s Great Wall that left me feeling breathless. Though Ankgor Wat was stunning its structural beauty was less impacting than I imagined it would be. The many temples of Bagan, though a feat of engineering, astonishing in size and scope, did not excite me to the same enormity. That is because none posses the same brand of majesty as does the magnificent Taj Mahal. No other man made wonder is so wondrous. None can match that same sense of enchantment. It is unique in its atmosphere. And it appears that I am not the only one so taken by the Taj...

As a cultural icon all around the world, the Taj Mahal attracts much artistic attention and it has been described so beautifully so many times before. Writer and painter Rabindranath Tagore, whose work we saw recently exhibited in Calcutta, described it evocatively as “a tear drop that glistened spotlessly bright on the cheeks of time"", a poignant reference to both form and feeling. Tagore is not alone in his suggestion of tears. Emperor Shah Jahan himself, the man behind the creation of the Taj, described the monument in these words:
Taj Mahal reflected


“Should guilty seek asylum here, like one pardoned, he becomes free from sin. Should a sinner make his way to this mansion, all his past sins are to be washed away. The sight of this mansion creates sorrowing sighs; and the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes. In this world this edifice has been made; to display thereby the creator's glory.”

A considerably less eloquent portrayal of this monument to love came from the mouth of contemporary thinker Karl Pilkington, perhaps better known as the” Idiot Abroad.” You may or may not be familiar with his thought-provoking words of wisdom, of which there are many. Here I share with you, for your reading pleasure, Mr. Pilkington’s perception of the famous Taj as the manifestation of a guilty conscience:

“If I brought flowers home for she’d be like ‘What have you done?’ But if I built her that she’d be like ‘WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?”

Eloquently put, Karl. But who am I to judge, for this here trivial blog will stand as my own eternal tribute to an edifice which is beyond both my comprehension and my ability to generate sufficiently

beautiful prose.

Both Chris and I were thankful that the train ride was comparatively peaceful and blissfully uneventful. We were not troubled unlike the last journey, other than being besieged by a hasty mother who practically threw her small son at me, because of course I am a woman and I must be simply itching to mind that child she birthed whist she sits back to enjoy the ride. Thanks for asking!

Free at last from obligatory child minding duties, Chris and I sat together watching India’s countryside pass us by. Fields of waist high shrubs bearing sunshine yellow flowers camouflaged women at their work, dressed in vibrant saris despite the nature of their vocation. They looked ever beautiful, swathed in the ample cloth. However, the men’s fashion in India is all too retro, dress from a previous decade; a time of silk shirts, flared pants, sweater vests and the moustache. Intermittently as we passed each village we would see the local males playing ferocious games of cricket. Its cliché, but it’s true.

Agra greeted us in the early morning but hid from us its crowning jewel as we rode the auto rickshaw to our
Gothic looking reflection
hotel, accessed via a narrow alleyway bordered on both sides by small canals of raw sewage. We had already heard that besides the obvious, Agra has little else to offer, more so that it is dirty and unpleasant. We had been advised to stay for as short a time as possible, not even staying the night if feasible. For the sake of our sanity we hate to rush in and out of a place so we decided to stay for at least two nights, and were ultimately not dissatisfied with our choice. Thankfully the hotel we had chosen was liveable and we were delighted to find a beautiful rooftop garden awaiting us from which views of the Taj Mahal could not be surpassed. So now the Taj had been revealed to us, and we fell... head first!

Many hours passed for us as we observed both the Taj and Agra from this lofty vantage point. We realised that we had become spectators to a private viewing of a Disney classic, right in front of us, in H.D. The town of Agra and it’s goings on surrounded us, its buildings projecting bluntly up from the ground, closely spaced and without

uniform height. Homes coloured blue, pink, yellow; pastel hues faded into a state of almost-attractive dilapidation. Monkeys fought noisily on the level roof tops, raucous and untamed, until an irritated proprietor would rush out, broom handle at the ready however ill-equipped in speed and reaction to present a genuine threat. Instead, they threw stones, aimlessly. Chris caught me daydreaming; I gave it away most likely because I catching flies (mouth hanging wide). He asked if I was thinking about having a pet tiger named Raja. I didn’t have to answer, because he already knew.

After showering away the dirt and the cold acquired during the night train we jumped on a bus destined for the town of Fatehpur Sikri, just 40km away. It took just an hour to reach and upon our arrival we snaked between small houses set on the steep hill before the Jama Masjid Mosque, which we found, surrounded by ridiculous, sweater wearing Billy goats.

The mosque itself was beautiful; an aesthetic delight, but the overall experience spoilt by a relentless onslaught of unofficial and irritating “guides” and children putting out their hands asking for chocolate. It was a challenge which we chose to accept;
Beautiful
to photograph the place feigning isolation, I confess to the reader now that our photographs of the mosque may be a trifle misleading. However, we failed in our search for personal solace as we sat in a far, shady corner. Instead our stomachs lead us back to town for lunch.

In the afternoon we paid our admission to visit the red palace. We knew even before our rupees had been returned that the cashier had considerably short-changed us. We politely asked for the remainder, on the off chance that it was in fact an honest mistake, to which the notes were thrown at us abruptly. I wish I could say that this was our only experience of poor manners this day, but only a short time passed before a teenage girl commanded us to “move aside” for her with a waft of her hand. Though worry not; she was left reprimanded and blushing where she stood as a usually tolerant Chris told the insolent madam in no uncertain terms that this was not an appropriate way to speak to people. It’s a miserable observation to pass that the locals of Agra were generally very discourteous, even contemptuous to us
Muslim man followed by his wife
as foreigners, without good reason.

Together we laughed it off and it failed to ruin our day. We walked leisurely about the palace, sharing facts and other novelties acquired from the guidebook which told interestingly of the Emperor Akbar’s many wives of different faiths from around the world whom he housed luxuriously in the grounds. The palace’s most lovely attraction was the Ornamental Pool and pavilion where we sat leisurely so as to fully enjoy.

Soon we found ourselves on the rooftop of our hotel once again to eat a delicious dinner as the sun set about the Taj. The light slowly faded until the orange skies paled before becoming inky and black, concealing the building almost completely. Only the faintest hint remained to see for those who knew it had stood there previously.

The next day, morning had yet to break but we were up and out. We made our way to the West entrance and joined the small queue that had already formed. We didn’t wait long before acquiring tickets and then had to join another, gender segregated line to pass through security. Now the main gateway stood in our midst, towering before the Taj
Incomparably beautiful
on account of proximity, concealing the marble with its orange brickwork, a construction of obvious Arabic designs. As we approached, the Taj Mahal could be seen up close for the first time, framed in the curvaceous doorway through which we then passed.

Standing before this illustrious cenotaph, we were awestruck! The dawn light was not yet prevalent enough to properly illuminate the white marble and the paleness of the structure almost blended with the pallid, early morning sky. This must be one of the most arresting attributes of the Taj; it’s innate ability to transform with light. To absorb, reflect and to radiate; modify and become a spectrum of colour as daytime shifts. I’m sure this can only be realised upon a face to face meeting.

During this travel adventure I have on occasion been ambushed by a swelling sensation in my throat which leads to the prickle and threat of tears in my eyes despite experiencing no feelings of sadness, but simply because I feel so acutely fortunate for an occurrence as it happens. It happened this time, before the lovely Taj, and it seemed nonsensical as I stood there with so many others knowing that not
Fatehpur Sikri
only myself but hundreds of millions of others will share this experience at different times. Yet I felt fantastically lucky all the same. I still do.

Together we passed the Diana bench where people mimicked regal poses before a backdrop of other tourists. We reached the stunning pools, elongated mirrors of pristine recreation. Here the perfect symmetry and architectural supremacy of the Taj is showcased best. We took many photographs with which we were especially pleased. The building could not be more photogenic. Yet another compliment to the site is that, despite the many tourists, there is still space to sit in seclusion, space enough to really enjoy it.

In all we spent about three hours there, dividing our time between the gardens and the platform, from which angle the monument is transformed again and the sheer size revealed. From here the intricacy of the design can be realised and appreciated. This white marble monolith is the epitome of senseless adornment; towering columns of Arabic script taken from the Koran, outer walls decorated elaborately with tasteful floral pattern, stone of different name, property and colour fit together as jigsaw pieces creating Aztec-like design. The dominant architectural influence is
In black & white
unarguably Islamic, which is obvious from that celebrated tear drop-like pinched dome roof (though religious influence, if any, is highly debated). At its heart is the mausoleum where husband and wife rest together eternally. This hollow room is shared also by pigeons and filled less than peacefully during daytime hours by ephemeral observers.

Eventually and with regret we drew ourselves away from the Taj only to spend the remainder of our time staring at it fixatedly from our rooftop while we maintained our full bellies. Though we had planned to visit Agra Fort and nearby bazzar our plans failed to materialise. We just couldn’t steal ourselves away.

In considering whether the Taj Mahal is a “romantic location” it is not plain for me to answer. I hadn’t imagined it to be, and therefore I did not find it to be (though being there on the arm of my handsome boyfriend was very pleasant). Of course it has its romantic story; being built for a dead wife by a husband who was later imprisoned by his own son and was thus only able to view it from his distant prison cell. It is a tragic account of Shakespearean proportions.
Red walls of Fatehpur Sikri
The Taj is beautiful and the idea of it is especially romantic but that does not necessarily mean that love is in the air, tourists are not walking around perpetually doe eyed, I assure you. It appears that not everyone is best please with the epic romantic gesture that is the Taj, the ultimate display of one-upmanship if you will. Members of the male species might well complain that Shah Jahan outperformed all romantic gestures to follow, a similar sentiment as that expressed by Mr. Pilkington. Take Urdu poet Sahir Ludhianvi who spoke of his frustration lyrically, exposing his insecurity in the face of such an extravagant gesture of love, for he would never be able to provide his lover a gift of such grandeur. I leave you with his words of lament:

""Countless men in this world must have loved and gone,
Who would say their loves weren’t truthful or strong?
But in the name of their loves, no memorial is raised
For they too, like you and me, belonged to the common throng…

This bank of Jamuna, this edifice, these groves and lawns,
These carved walls and doors, arches and alcoves,
An emperor on the strength
The most photogenic building in the world
of wealth, Has played with us a cruel joke.
Meet me hence, my love, at some other place.""

February 21st 2012
Published: February 24th 2012


Interesting Face
India is a whirlwind of a travel destination; Varanasi could well be the eye of the storm. The city is thought to be one of the oldest continually inhabited communities in the world, a title not lost on the locals. An elderly man asked us rhetorically “How old is your oldest city? Just a few hundred years?” and laughed playfully. Varanasi is of course famed the world over for its burning ghats, a gruesome tourist attraction which isn’t a tourist attraction at all but an ancient custom of massive religious importance. This here is India’s spiritual epicentre but you would be mistaken to conjure images of Zen-like paradise; serene, tranquil. This is India, after all. Pandemonium awaits you in pious Varanasi.

But prior to experiencing this tempestuous culture shock first hand, we would have to get there first. This entailed a steep three hour descent by jeep down the mountains of Darjeeling to NJP train station, where we would then board a train for a further twelve hours. At the station we sat perched atop our backpacks out of the way so as to be inconspicuous as possible. As Europeans we seem to attract a lot of unwanted attention at
Yoga
stations and subsequently pass the hours refusing shoe shines (wearing flip flops), ear cleaning (for some reason they are surprised we don’t want them rooting down our ear canal with a stick that’s well acquainted with some other folk’s lug hole) and relentless begging. There was a lot of activity at the station and we had to keep keen eyes on both our pockets and our bags. We knew already from passing that this area has a high concentration of somewhat feral looking street kids in gangs, no doubt run by gangs. A few days previous I sat in the jeep waiting to depart for Darjeeling and watched as an adolescent girl slapped a much smaller girl of about three years hard across the face. Now as we sat waiting we were given little warning as a beggar woman stood before us peeing down her legs and skirt. Awkward and not knowing what to do otherwise we looked to our feet. “Shoe shine mister?”

Our joy to be off the platform and on the train was short lived. We located our bunks and all was well other than some intense staring and feeling a little intimidated being the only
Varanasi architecture
female around, but that hasn’t been uncommon during our time in India so far; where are all the women?! I’ve been developing my technique for dealing with the unwanted attention; firstly, I ignore, give them the opportunity to get it out of their system, but all too often I am required to resort to the next stage; stare back, though this never fails to tie a knot my stomach. For those who are particularly relentless, as were the bunch I was faced with on the train this time, I’ve recently found the courage to say quite loudly “Stop it!” at which point they usually embarrass and turn away. But nothing was deterring these guys, so I was forced into hiding behind a t-shirt. I’m planning on learning to say “stop staring” in Hindi, which might help, but Chris and I have also been working on my “scary face” (imagine an unconvincing tiger), so perhaps I’ll give that a go soon...freak them out a bit.

So, some time before midnight we pulled into a nondescript station as I was tucked away in my top bunk retreat. An alarming commotion started from the platform outside and my heart caught in my
Young love!
throat. Banging on the metal shell of the train, howling and screaming ensued as our carriage was bombarded by at least a hundred men and many more ran madly outside. I couldn’t find an alternative explanation for what was happening and concluded that we were being attacked! My thought process must have been clear from my expression and a Nepalese man occupying the next bunk explained that it was OK, they were soldiers on their way home. They had no tickets and expected those with reserved beds to move for them, which they did to avoid conflict with these outwardly aggressive military personnel. Lucky for us they stayed clear of our beds, other than propping their dirty feet or rudely throwing their bags (which I defiantly kicked away in my “sleep,” woops-a-daisy).

Our small compartment meant for eight people now had more than twice that amount, the entire carriage was fit to burst and the combination of heat, noise and smells made for a very uncomfortable night. A young man close by caught my eye and looked concerned. He asked me was I frightened and I answered him saying “why would I be?!” He assured me that they would
Relaxing
be gone by 2.30am and that if I had any problems, just let him know; quite the gentleman.

Dawn came leisurely and I could no longer hope for or feign sleep. The soldiers were still aboard and it transpired that our train was much delayed, six hours by this point. By the time we arrived in Varanasi the train was a total of fourteen hours overdue, turning a standard twelve hour ride into an ungodly twenty-six hour test of endurance. Further, the previous two days I had been laid up in Darjeeling and by the time we arrived in Varanasi I had not eaten for four days. The long, hot, dirty train ride was a proverbial “nail in coffin” with respects to my health.

As those long, tedious hours on the train passed I mentally checked out but Chris managed to make friends with some particularly lovely fellows from Assam. Together they talked for the duration of the ride. The other men in our compartment were also from India’s North East states and very nice indeed. Together Chris and I have decided that this is the place from which India’s true gentlemen are borne, an opinion we know
Flower
will greatly please a certain friend of ours, a native of Shilong!

Crawling from one station to another just to wait for an hour before shuffling along again we were presented ample viewing time at the window. The tracks were lined with litter, so much that it seems impossible for this place to ever be clean again. What’s more, we saw more than our fair share of people squatting to use the bathroom besides the rails, which is less than pleasant, but of course we had been forewarned previous to our arrival. If you haven’t seen someone squatting on a trip to India, you didn’t do it right! Buildings along the way were painted with the words “abandoned” and whole families had moved in to squat. From our little window it was plain to see some of the social problems India is facing, less obvious being the available solutions.

Our journey was slowly but surely nearing its end. The train quietened and we were fooled into a false sense of security. We began to relax. In no time at all we were under siege once more. The train filled again and people fought to sit where there was
Snake Charmer
simply no room. A dense looking man moved into our compartment demanding that we should all move from the seats we had reserved and paid for, unlike him, so that his mother could sit. There was never a need for such demonstration; all being well mannered people someone would have moved to make way for his elderly mother. But when a space was freed this man filled it with his own backside leaving his frail mother to stand and us with our mouths agape. Now came the sour faced woman’s turn to speak unkindly, not to her son but the others. This time no one would move, deciding in an unspoken agreement that it was her son’s responsibility to allow his mother to sit - but he sat their sneering. Never before have I encountered a person so obnoxious. We couldn’t get to Varanasi quick enough.

Upon awaking the next morning in a hotel room, the sign for which read falsely “Yes, we are less dirty”, I found myself sick as a pig. Two days more of being unable to eat or get out of bed, growing weaker and causing Chris concern. He located the nearest hospital, which wasn’t
Early morning bathing in the ganges
too far away and also had a travel clinic. We planned to go the next day should my situation not improve, but in the meantime the antibiotics we were given by a doctor in Korea for such an occasion started to work, much to our combined relief. Always during times of sickness I miss my mum most, desperately in fact. After a long phone call with her my spirits were lifted, and with a little food in my belly so were my energy levels. For two days I’d been restricted to that little bed with dirty sheets, listening to the hustle and bustle of Varanasi and feeling spiteful toward Chris as he returned from a walk along the ghats buzzing with euphoria from experiencing the sights and sounds outside the hotel walls. The first day had not been such an issue for me as little was happening outside due to local elections that day, but the day following I became envious and mean and started to feel sorry for myself. I couldn’t help but reflect on the irony that I had worked so hard to recover from my surgery in England which had so nearly ruined our trip, all the
Offerings
time dreaming of India where I should have been, and now here I was, in India, sick in some way once again.

We extended our stay so that when I was recovered I would have time to fully appreciate the place. When I finally laid my eyes on it, Varanasi as a whole, it stole my breath away! There is little aesthetic beauty here, comparative to the way I had naively imagined Varanasi to be; not attractive in any obvious or conventional way at least, though Chris and I disagree on this point. The old town is a maze of shade-cooled alleyways which can be tricky to pass on account of them being so narrow and foot traffic so dense. You have to be mindful of the occasional reckless motorbikes passing through too quickly and particularly wary of the holy heifers as they fill the path. Some are preposterous in size and sharply horned which makes meeting them, quite literally down a dark alley, a real and daunting prospect. You must also be careful for the mess they leave behind!

Out of the streets and onto the ghats life is fast moving, colourful, bustling, exciting, intense. Sadhus and
Smiling
Babas, Hindu holy men, sit eccentrically decorated; painted and preened. One with long hair piled high on his head, the next possessing his own gimmick of sorts, each giving blessings for a price. Occasionally we paid a small sum to take a photo, because in India nothing is free. The perfect backdrop for any photo; a mass of activity everywhere you look provides un-missable photo opportunities. Your busy eyes tire quickly as they watch pilgrims bathing in the holy river, the mother Ganges, so filthy it’s technically septic, yet these devout Hindus swim, bathe in and even drink it with honour. Snake charmers lull cobras at each corner and at every turn there is a con man wanting to shake your hand; once he latches on to you he won’t let go until you pay him for his kind service, a hand massage. Then he’ll ask to shave you.

Monkeys skip from one rooftop to the next making a nuisance of themselves and giving the mangy street dogs a run for their money. Lime green parakeets fly from tree to tree, a reminder of our exotic location. We watched them from the rooftop of our favoured restaurant, the Lotus
Washing in the ganges
Lounge, where the food was clean and reliable (for my sake) and the view along the whole length of the ghats insurmountable. From our table we surveyed how varied the buildings were in size and colour, even in style and elegance as a faded royal palace juts out every once in a while.

Many times we navigated up and down the many steps along the river, visiting each ghat with its own features and unique selling point. The show stopper, however, is the flaming Manikarnika ghat. Here many congregate. Wood is piled high and weighed on balanced scales to calculate the price of cremation, typically 4,000 rupees. The surrounding buildings are blemished, blackened by the continual smouldering of funeral pyres; bodies, as many as ten at a time, burn here all day and night long. There is less pomp and majesty than I’d expected for such a revered practice in such a holy location. It’s a great thing for a Hindu to “expire” in Varanasi as it frees them from the continual life cycle of reincarnation, so they believe. We watch as men carry lifeless bodies wrapped and adorned with flowers. First the corpse is washed in the Ganges.
Sadhu
Next it is placed upon the stack of wood and covered with yet more timber. The men circle the body numerous times, the sons’ heads are already shaven and their bodies clothed in white, according to tradition. A fire is started and the family depart. It takes approximately three hours for the body to become ash. Remnants are thrown into the river. Only Sadhu’s and children will not be cremated, as they are free from sin. Instead they are submerged in the holy river.

Unsurprisingly, it is hot at the burning ghats. For this reason we never stayed long, not to mention I am not wholly comfortable watching a live cremation. It’s a flaw in my character, I don’t cope well with death and the dead. Ironic that my mother has made her living up until recently working at a funeral home. Before coming to India I have never bore witness to something I would later wish to repress. I’ve been in this country just shy of three weeks now, and since arriving I have seen things that I have instantly regretted. The first was in Calcutta, turning to see the headless body of a goat writhing despite its
Varanasi buildings
obvious cranium deficiency. The following two occasions were right here in Varanasi as I stood at the ghats watching the flesh burn from and blacken a pair of feet. It was bizarre not to be able to stop myself from watching however much I wanted to. The third time, I will tell of shortly.

We spent so much of our time in Varanasi just soaking in the atmosphere and watching people pass by. It must be wedding season in India now. Women wearing red saris, dripping gold, stand by young husbands in elaborate hats and they enter the temples together to the sound of beating drums. On one occasion we watched as a mother threw herself to the ground continually leading the wedding procession in some archaic tradition.

Our final night we spent at Dasaswamedh ghat, where there is a nightly performance, which in itself is not greatly entertaining nor interesting but very atmospheric. The following morning we took a boat along the river for sunrise for a new perspective. It took an hour in total to row up and down, from the small burning Harishchandra ghat to Manikarnika, taking in numerous other ghats between the two. It
Wind
was a good opportunity to take photographs of first time pilgrims excitedly splashing in the cold water and sadhus preparing themselves for the coming day, but we got so much more than we had bargained for.

After taking in all the sights we were returning to our hotel on the small wooden vessel. A pack of street dogs gathered by the river and we were sickened to see them eating another dead dog, half submerged. But, that looks too big to be a dog... a cow perhaps?! No, the cows are sacred here, the people would never allow that to happen. Having really studied the pale, bloated shape in the water, trying to determine what animal these dogs where feasting upon it dawned on us suddenly. Like a smack in the face. I couldn’t avert my attention quick enough, but doing so now was redundant as I had been looking for too long already. The boat driver announced casually, “that is a human body.” And there it is, moment of regret number three. I’ll never be able to forget it, try as I might.

A human body, washed up from the river, being eaten by dogs;
Local Woman
that was exactly what it was. Somehow the other tourists on their separate boats hadn’t noticed. I felt quite angry at the situation and asked the driver, “why isn’t anyone doing something about it?” to which he replied, “The dogs will only come back.” No, sir, that was not the point I was trying to make. That corpse is someone’s mother or father, surely a sense of empathy dictates that we should not allow the body to be eaten by dogs in the street. Surely it should be returned to the river as it was intended to be, for the sake of decency! For me, there was so much at fault with this situation.

Ten minutes later I found myself back in our hotel room, numb with disbelief. I was upset by what I had seen and I burst into tears but immediately felt ridiculous for my reaction. I’m in India and I must accept everything as a cultural difference. Though I’m sure if I had seen the same thing in my home town I would be afforded my natural reaction for this thing would be absurd, even horrifying. Strange that “place” will so much dictate how
Kids in a boat
we should feel.

With such feelings, we left Varanasi for Agra...

February 20th 2012
Published: February 24th 2012


Deities
Ich bin früh aufgestanden und stehe vor dem Eingang zum Sri Krishna-Balarama Tempel aus weißem Marmor. Einem der schönsten Tempel in Vrindavan.

Der Krishna-Balarama gehört zu den Haupttempeln (in Vrindavan gibt es insgesamt zwischen vier -und fünftausend, so genau weiß das niemand) und liegt am Ortseingang, gleich an der Hauptstraße vom Highway kommend.

Da mir das Ganze aus einem früheren Tempelaufenthalt in Deutschland vertraut ist, gehe ich dahin. Ein bisschen Yoga für den Geist, meine neu erstandene Gebetskette nehme ich mit.

Die Tempelanlage besteht aus dem vorderen Teil, mit prächtigen weißen Bauten, in dem Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada verehrt und erklärt wird - der letzte Lehrer, der das Singen des Hare-Krishna-Mantra in die Welt trug und die Philosophie des Bhakti-Yoga lehrte. Er war es auch, der diesen prächtigen Tempel 1975 neu erbauen ließ.

Im Westen wurden die ""Hare Krishna Jünger"" in den Siebzigern be- und später als spinnerige Sekte verkannt. Die Bewegung ist aber in Indien nur eine von vielen Arten, sich den vielen Göttern des Hinduismus zu nähern.

Ich gehe durch ein Tor und über einen Innenhof weiter in einen zweiten Bau, in dem drei meterhohe Schreine mit Gottheiten stehen.

Die Götter

In der
frisch gesegnete Gebetskette
Mitte steht der Hauptaltar mit den beiden göttlichen Brüdern Krishna und Balarama. Krishna ist eine menschliche Form des Gottes Vishnu, ebenso gilt sein Bruder als die nächste Inkarnation des gleichen Gottes.

Links davon stehen Sri Sri Gaura Nitai, Inkarnationen des Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu und Nityananda Prabhu, die vor etwa 500 Jahren in Westbengalen erschienen. Sri Caitanya gilt als Inkarnation des Gottes Shiva. Im 15. Jahrhundert belebte er die verlorengegangene Erinnerung an Krishna und die Philsophie der ""liebevollen Hingabe"" (bhakti yoga) wieder.

Auf dem dritten Altar stehen Sri Sri Radha Shyamasundara mit den liebsten und vertrautesten Gopis, Lalita und Vishakha. Radha ist die Geliebte und Vertraute Krishnas, die sich als Kuhhirtin für Krishna manifestierte. Sie ist die inkarnierte Göttin Lakshmi.

Diese Götter werden als direkte Präsenz des Gottes Krishna verstanden, und obwohl er sich hier in einer marmornen Form manifestiert habe, sei er nicht verschieden vom Gott selbst. Das ist recht schwer zu verstehen, aber Glauben ist ja selten rational erklärbar.

Wer vor dieser Gottheit bete, singe und tanze, habe Zugang zum Planeten des Brahma und soll dort vom ewigen Kreislauf aus Geburt und Wiedergeburt erlöst werden. Das gesamte angesammelte, schlechte Karma eines Menschen würde hier im
Zeremonie
Tempel verschwinden, da es machtlos in der Gegenwart des Gottes sei.

Na, dann wollen wir mal.

Die Zeremonie

Ich warte mit vielen anderen auf den Beginn der Zeremonie. Im Raum sitzen etwa zehn Devotees (eine Art Mönch) mit traditionellen Musikinstrumenten und singen das Maha Mantra. Das klingt hier den ganzen Tag, es verstummt immer nur mittags und ab Mitternacht für kurze Zeit:

hare krisna hare krisna krisna krisna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare


Der Gesang ist erst sehr langsam und eingängig und da ich mal gehört habe, dass all das bisher angesammelte schlechte Karma durch den Gesang in Krishnas Gegenwart verschwindet, stimme ich ein. Dafür bin ich ja auch hier. Das ist etwa wie die Absolution durch Ave Marias beten.

Vielleicht alles Quatsch, aber vielleicht auch wahr. Ich finde das hier gerade sehr wohltuend und mache einfach mit, das Ritual lernt man schnell.

Die Gottheiten bekommen von den Gläubigen Blumen und Obst geschenkt, alles wird vor ihnen ausgebreitet. Der Raum hat so eine eigenartige Mischung aus Verkitschtem und Erhabenem, aus innerem Kopfschütteln und einer ja, ich mag es göttliche Präsenz nennen. Ich fühle mich zum ersten Mal wirklich wohl. Zwar immer noch allein und fern der Heimat und von allem Vertrauten, das geht auch
Ausflippen
hier nicht weg.

Natürlich wirke ich zwischen all den ""echten"" Gläubigen wie ein Fremdkörper. Aber hier darf jeder sein, jeder ist wilkommen, wie klein der Geist auch sein mag. Die irre Stimmung lenkt den Geist massiv ab, und das ist gut.

Die Statuen werden während der Zeremonie verhüllt, auch Götter brauchen scheinbar für einen Moment Privatsphäre. Währenddessen gehen die Gesänge ununterbrochen weiter und heben mit jeder Runde weiter an.

Ich singe ja eigentlich sehr ungern, aber das Mantra bringt mich in eine Art Rausch. Die Gesänge werden ekstatischer, immer lauter, die Gläubigen tanzen jetzt wild herum, so wie sie sich gerade fühlen. Ein bisschen wie Drogenkonsum ohne schädliche Nebenwirkungen.

Zwar mag ich nicht ganz so ausflippen, aber allein das Mantra hebt mich geistig in eine leichtere Verfassung, eigentlich ist es eine treffliche Meditationsübung, und ich halte durchaus für möglich, dass das der Seele hilft. Zumal es hier nach Blumen und Incense und Kokosmilch duftet - paradiesisch im Vergleich zu den Straßen. Und wenns nur den aufgewühlten Geist beruhigt, ist doch alles gut.

Das was ich meine zu erleben, ist allerdings nur ein Bruchteil dessen, was echte Gläubige im gleichen Moment neben mir veranstalten, die drehen
Feuer reinigt
sich wie Derwische, tanzen sich in Trance und nicht wenige sitzen am Ende der Zeremonie ausgepowert auf den Stufen des Tempels. Andere wiederum scheint das gar nicht zu inspirieren, sie meditieren eher in sich hinein. Aber es gibt ja auch sone und solche Christen, passt schon.

Dann wird es ganz kurz still. Vor den immer noch verhüllte Schreinen stehen drei ""Priester"" (pujaris) in weißen und safranfarbenen Gewändern und lassen mit großen Muscheln laute dunkle Töne erklingen.

Sie nehmen die Vorhänge beiseite und sofort setzen das Mantra wieder ein, wild, schnell und laut gechantet, wie zuvor. Das ist schon irre und jetzt drehen die Gläubigen richtig durch. Ich halte mich etwas an der Seite, aber singe mit und bin damit mit Glück mein schlechtes Karma los.

Bringt natürlich nur was, wenn jetzt nichts neues dazu kommt. Mal sehen, was sich da in Zukunft machen lässt... 😉

Dachterrasse mit hauseigenem Tempel
Ich sitze auf der Dachterrasse beim Tempel meines Guesthouses und versuche, eine volle Runde (108 Holzperlen, ein Mantra pro Perle) auf meiner frisch gesegneten Gebetskette zu singen. Ich komme mir ein bisschen bekloppt vor und das tolle Gefühl aus dem Tempel kommt auch nicht zurück. Nach etwa der halben Kette gebe ich auf, meine religiösen Bedürfnisse sind fürs erste überbefriedigt.

Ich schaue mir das Tempeldach, vor dem ich stehe etwas näher an und blicke über die Stadt. Ich habe hier viel gesehen, maximal noch ein Tag, dann geht es weiter. Aber wohin? Auf dem Programm stehen als nächstes Varanasi und Bodhgaya, danach die Sunderbans und Kalkutta. Darjeeling vielleicht, wenn noch Zeit ist.

Lust aufs Reisen habe ich keine mehr, hierbleiben ist auch keine Option. Viel lieber würde ich jetzt durch die sardische Berge ziehen und den Duft von blühenden Mandelbäumen atmen.

Gerade fange ich an, von zuhause zu träumen, da nähern sich Affen. Einer fühlt sich scheinbar richtig inspiriert, mich zu ärgern. Nicht nur Menschen, auch Tiere kennen hier keine Privatsphäre. Wer sich das wohl von wem abgeguckt hat... Furchtbar!

Langsam nehme ich meine Sachen und entferne mich, doch das Viech kommt mir natürlich hinterher. Ich halte
UploadedFile1
alles fest, was ich bei mir habe. Er wartet offensichtlich nur auf den richtigen Moment, so ein gerissener Kerl.

Gerade, als ich fast an meinem Zimmer bin, springt das Tier mich an. Der Horror!!! Ich habe eine kleine Kiste mit süßem Gebäck aus dem Tempel dabei, das riecht er wohl. Ich schreie ihn an und wedele mit meinem Tuch, das hält ihn auf Abstand bis ich meine Tür aufgeschlossen habe und sicher im Zimmer bin.

Mir vergeht erneut die Lust am Urlaub, dauernd diese Störfelder, ich bin müde, mich ständig zu arrangieren und nicht einfach ich zu sein. Dabei war der Tag bis hierher richtig schön. Ich bin rastlos und unzufrieden.

Später gehe ich hinaus ins Internetcafe, um mir die Reiseroute für den Rest der Zeit zu organisieren, da ich keine Lust habe, noch irgendetwas ""the indian way"" zu regeln oder regeln zu lassen.

Mir macht das keinen Spaß und ich war doch so glücklich! Und soll Urlaub nicht auch schön sein?! Mir wird langsam klar, dass das in diesem Land zumindest für mich eine echte Herausforderung ist.

Mich schreckt der kleine dunkle Aufgang zum weltweiten Netz im ersten Stock eines verfallenen Hauses nicht ab.
Internetcafe
Oh oh, gefährliches Stadium - ich werde gleichgültig...

Die PCs sind genauso dreckig und spackig wie in Köln-Porz, es ist glaube ich das Wesen eines Internetcafés, verwutzt zu sein. Einziger Unterschied: hier gibts keinen Kaffee.

Ich will jetzt etwas ""cocooniger"" reisen, einen Wagen mit Fahrer mieten, und möglichst nahe Ziele ansteuern, wie Jaipur, Ranthambore, die nächsten Klassiker abrocken. Im Tourist Golden Triangle. Und das als neugieriges, durchs Unterholz streifendes schwarzes Schaf! Passt mir gar nicht.

Auch nach längerer Recherche finde ich den nächste online buchbare Mietwagen-Station erst in Neu Delhi Flughafen.

Schlagartig wird mir klar, dass, wenn ich da hinfahre, um in den Mietwagen zu steigen, ich eher direkt zum Qatar-Schalter renne, um mein Flugticket umzubuchen.

Ich muss aufpassen, dass ich nicht direkt losschluchze, aber ich will nach Hause. Ich fühle mich hier nicht wohl und bin nicht bei mir.

Eine Stunde später ist mein Ticket umgebucht. Puh... Felsen für Felsen rumpelt von meinem kleinen Herzen. Ich belohne mich mit einem tollen Abendessen. Ich bekomme fünf verschiedene indische Pfannekuchen, eins mit Käse, eins mit Gurkenraita, eins mit Spinat, eins mit dem besten Mangochutney der Welt und eins mit Chiligemüse.

Pfannkuchen und die Aussicht
Dachtempel
auf Zuhause machen mich glücklich!

February 19th 2012
Published: February 24th 2012


Ananda Krishna Van
Endlich ausgeschlafen! Nach elfeinhalb Stunden Tiefschlaf sehe ich durchs Fenster in den Garten des Ashrams und fühle mich voller Energie und bin bereit, die heilige Stadt zu erkunden.

Der Tag beginnt am Lunchbuffet. Das Essen ist fantastisch, zehn verschiedene Kleinigkeiten stehen zur Auswahl... Ich muss von allem etwas nehmen! Linsensuppe, gebratener Paneer, Kartoffeln mit Spinat, Joghurt mit Paprika, süße Bällchen, Chapati, ... Kugelrund und satt beginne ich meinen Streifzug durch die Stadt.

Das ist also ein heiliger Ort. So klein ist der gar nicht, hier wohnen hier knapp 60.000 Menschen, die in einem unruhigen Rhythmus durch den Tag rauschen (was sie nicht stört, schon recht).

Die nächtliche Ruhe hat sich in Luft aufgelöst, auch hier ist Tumult hoch siebenunddrölfzig, wenn auch nicht vergleichbar mit Delhi oder Agra. LkW und fremde Autos (bis auf Taxis) müssen neuerdings aus dem Ort draußen bleiben, aber es fährt noch genug auf den Straßen herum. Ich werde permanent von Tuktuks angehupt, muss alle fünf Schritte einen Rikschafahrer abwehren, oder einen Bettler, der mich mit einem Hare Krishna überreden will, ihm ein paar rupees zu geben.

Sympathisch: die vielen Kühe, die hier wirklich überall frei rumlaufen und -liegen. Unsympathisch: die Affen, die gierig
Affe
schauen und immer auf dem Sprung sind. Und je weiter ich Richtung Ortsmitte gehe, desto dichter kommt auch wieder der DAGL, also Dreck, Aufdringlichkeit, Gestank und Lärm.

Ich versuche es mal wieder mit der Taktik, offen und freundlich lächelnd auf die Menschen zuzugehen, doch auch hier wird jedes Lächeln, jedes Anhalten, jedes Interesse sofort als ""ich kaufe was"" oder ""du gefällst mir"" gedeutet. Beides ist in 98%!d(MISSING)er Fälle nicht richtig. Grundlegendes Interesse aneinander scheint zumindest im Straßenalltag zu fehlen. Vielleicht ist es auch gar nicht gewollt.

In den Bazars von Old Vrindavan

In den engen Gassen der Bazars von Old Vrindavan (ein wenig vergleichbar mit den Soukhs in Marrakesh, nur wieder deutlich dreckiger und weniger bunt, es fehlt das 1001-Nacht-Feeling) will ich tatsächlich etwas kaufen: eine Gebetskette aus Holzperlen vom heiligen Tulasi tree, für meinen Tempelbesuch morgen.

Die erste kaufe am Ende bei einem Händler, der mich nicht in seinen Stand hineinquatschte (weil er auch kein Englisch sprach, aber das ist ja nicht unbedingt was schlechtes).

Ich wende mich dann etwas weiter die Straße runter an einen zweiten Stand und kaufe eine kleine Kette aus Zedernholz, und frage ein bisschen nach, warum der Baum
Kuh in Vrindavan
eigentlich heilig ist. Doch der Mann war durch mein Handeln zuvor (um 20 rupees) fast beleidigt, und kaum hat er das Geschäft abgewickelt, widmet er sich anderen Kunden.

Dritter Versuch ein paar Meter weiter. Da hängen verschieden große Ketten aus Tulasiholz, mal grob verarbeitet, mal weich schmeichelnd geschliffen. Ich frage, was es mit den Bäumen auf sich hat, warum es der Tulasi sein muss. Der Händler fragt: ""you want one? very nice!"". Ich sage ""maybe"" und er zeigt mir mindestens zwanzig verschiedene Größen und betet Preise herunter.

Ich frage wieder nach der Tradition und wo die Bäume wachsen, ob er selbst die Handarbeit macht. ""all good for temple, you take one."" Ich finde es so schade, dass kein Gespräch zustande kommt. Am Ende habe ich drei hübsche Gebetsketten und 400 rupees weniger, weiß aber leider nichts (zum Glück gibt's Internet: http://www.stephen-knapp.com/tulasi_devi_the_sacred_tree.htm).

Aber insgesamt ist es ein deutlich entspannteres Umherstreifen als noch vorgestern in Delhi. Ich kann Fotos machen und die Leute sind hier alles in allem sehr nett. Man merkt, dass dies kein alltäglicher Platz ist, sondern in erster Linie ein Pilgerort. Doch, ich find's schön hier. Auch DAGL ist hier halbwegs aushaltbar und so hatte ich
Kuhnst
es mir in etwa vorgestellt.

Nach den Erfahrungen mit meinem Guesthouse in Delhi (ein Zimmer ohne Fenster müffelt eben entsprechend) kaufe ich noch Räucherstäbchen für mein jetziges Zimmer, obwohl es da keinen Grund zur Beanstandung gibt, aber es schadet ja nicht. Und wer weiß, was für Unterkünfte da noch kommen mögen. Dann noch ein neues Schultertuch und ich hatte irgendwann genug geshoppt.

Das fanden die Händler aber keinesfalls. Wer eine Tüte trägt, hat was gekauft. Und der kann auch noch mehr kaufen! Und was es nicht alles sein soll. Wolldecken, Schmuck, Medikamente, Krishna-Bilder, ... Wieder tu ich das, was am besten hilft, mir aber nicht gefällt: Augen auf den Boden senken und alles wortlos ignorieren.

Nach der Grund-Demystifizierung an den ersten beiden Tagen, kommt aber der Zauber Indiens ein bisschen durch. Auch hier wird er weiter angeknabbert, weil ich mich alle paar Meter gegen Aufdringlichkeit wehren und Leute ignorieren muss, um halbwegs im Budget zu bleiben und durch die Straßen zu kommen.

Sightseeing

Ach, noch etwas Sightseeing. Ich summe ein Mantra vor mich hin, das der Ashram empfohlen hat (""makes easy find peace and good places""). Der Weg allerdings ist trotz Mantra anstrengend (die alten
Blumen für die Götter
vier Gründe, DAGL). Mir macht das immer noch keinen Spaß, ich sehne nach meinem Zimmer. Aber das ist weit weg, denn obwohl bezogen auf die Einwohnerzahl klein, ist Vrindavan doch weitläufig.

Ich brauche eine Auszeit zwischendurch und fliehe in eine Tempelanlage. Das Hauptgebäude ist geschlossen aber der Innenhof ist zugänglich und weitgehend menschenfrei! Hat das Mantra doch was gebracht, toll! Ich will hier ein wenig sitzen und die Sonne genießen, immerhin sind es heute 25 Grad und das Klima ist sehr angenehm.

Das mit der Wärme und dolce vita hat Italien aber deutlich besser drauf - wie toll wäre jetzt hier ein kleines Café mit einem Vino und einem Sorbetto ... Aber nein, no chance, diese Art Leichtigkeit hier zu finden. Naja, dafür sollte ich wohl einfach in Italien bleiben und nicht nach Indien reisen ... 😉

Der Tuktuklärm und die Hupen dröhnen bis in den Tempeleingang herein, und gerade als ich meine Schritte verlangsame, werde ich direkt von einem Herrn angesprochen. ""temple is closed, I show you another one, much better"". Er sieht nett aus, also lächle ich und sage ""no, thank you.""

Das ist für ihn natürlich keine akzeptable Antwort, also fragt er noch
Marktplatz
dreimal. Auch nach dem dritten Nein geht er nicht. Er will mir die Stadt zeigen. Ich setze mich hin, in der Hoffnung, dass er dann das Nein besser versteht, und sage ""I just want to stay here and enjoy"" - was er mit einem ""you enjoy evening time, when temple is open, now I show you all the nice places Vrindavan"". Ich schüttele den Kopf, ""no, thank you"".

Er, Gopal, erklärt mir, dass ich das hier alles nicht verstehen könne, wenn ich keinen guide habe. Ich glaube ihm das und er scheint nett zu sein. Trotzdem würde ich jetzt lieber in die Sonne blinzeln, das kann ich auch ohne Führung.

Als ein anderer guide hinzukommt, entbrennt der Kampf um meine Gunst. Einer war schon zuviel, was soll ich denn mit zweien! Es muss wohl so etwas wie ""ich hab sie zuerst gesehen"" heißen. Sie werden richtig laut und schreien sich an.

Mir reichts. Als ich aufstehe und gehe, läuft Gopal mir hinterher und schlägt einen Deal vor: Er zeigt mir einen Garten, in dem es wirklich friedlich ist, das kostet nichts und dauert fünfzehn Minuten. Wenn es mir gefällt, soll ich morgen wiederkommen und er zeigt mir
Seva Kunj Krishna Garden
die Stadt für 50 rupees. Das ist nicht teuer, er ist nett und mit dem ""friedlichen Garten"" hat er mich endlich umgestimmt. Vielleicht werde ich ihn danach wirklich los.

Und natürlich hat er recht damit, dass ich so mehr von einer Stadt sehe: Den Platz hätte ich allein nie gefunden, er stand auch nicht im Reiseführer und am Weg zum Eingang saßen rund 20 arme, kranke Menschen, die mich sicher abgehalten hätten, in diese Seitenstraße einzubiegen.

Seva Kunj Krishna Garden

Also, der Garten. Hier hat der Gott Krishna in Menschengestalt mit den Hirtenmädchen (Gopis) getanzt. Der alte Krishna war so eine Art Schwerenöter und Charmeur, der nichts anbrennen ließ. Wer badenden Mädchen ihre Kleider stiehlt, nur um sie in einen Garten zu locken und dort mit ihnen zu ""tanzen"", ist vielleicht nicht gerade der Inbegriff von Heiligkeit.

Aber die Geschichte in den vedischen Schriften hat absolut nichts Anrüchiges. Apropos, hier scheint sogar der Gestank auf wundersame Weise ausgeschaltet. Der Garten besteht aus niedrigen, stachligen Bäumen, deren Äste und Kronen sich treffen, als würden sie einander tatsächlich anfassen und gemeinsam tanzen.

In der Nacht, erzählt Gopal, wird der Garten geschlossen und die Affen daraus vertrieben. Wenn
Eingang zum Garten
alle Affen weg sind, kehrt Krishna mit den Mädchen zurück, um die seit Jahrhunderten andauernden Tänze fortzusetzen.

Hier und da sind kleine Tempel, der eine als ""makeup room"" mit allerlei Farben und Blumen ausgestattet, damit die Gopis sich für die Tänze zurecht machen können. Gläubige bringen die Sachen jeden Tag hierher, irgendwie anrührend diese Hingabe.

Ein wirklich schöner Ort und ich komme vielleicht tatsächlich wieder, um noch mehr Plätze zu sehen. Die 50 rupees will ich Gopal schon heute geben, das war der Garten wert. Aber er winkt ab und tatsächlich lässt er mich mit einem freundlichen Gruß gehen.

Der gute Moment wirkt leider nicht lang, gleich hinter der nächsten Häuserecke laufe ich in eine stinkende Wolke, dass mir fast übel wird. Abwasserkanäle links und rechts des Weges, die Hunde trinken daraus, ich kotze fast hinein. Klärwerk hoch zehn. Furchtbar.

Schön und hässlich sind hier Zwillingsschwestern, so nah beieinander. Ich bin froh um mein neues Tuch und lege es mir um Kopf und Nase. Ich muss lachen und denke nur, dass eine Burka vielleicht keine so schlechte Idee und in Wirklichkeit gar keine Bevormundung ist. Sie schützt vor Lärm und Gestank und gierigen Blicken, und man
Vögel in Stromkabeln
hat seine kleine Privatsphäre immer dabei...

Yamuna, der heilige Fluss

Ich gehe weiter Richtung Fluss Yamuna (auch heilig, natürlich) und hoffe auf die vielbesungene landschaftliche Schönheit. Aber nichts da.

Der Fluss teilt das Schicksal europäischer Artgenossen und darf nicht mehr fließen wie er will. Man hat ihn aber nicht begradigt, sondern nur verschoben, damit die Stadt wachsen konnte. Das neue Flussbett ist mit Baggern ausgehoben und der Schlamm zu den Seiten aufgetürmt worde. Nicht unbedingt landschaftlich reizvoll.

Auf dem alten Flussbett wurde gebaut, es reiht sich eine Baustelle an die andere. Weiters findet man hier kleine Tempel, die oft nicht mehr sind als ein Dach mit einer Gottheit; hierin leben alte Sadhus, schlafen und beten auf dem nackten Boden.

Einer breitet seine Hände in meine Richtung aus für eine Segnung, netter Mensch, ich bedanke mich. ""10 rupees"" ruft jemand neben ihm. Sadhus sind auch nicht mehr das, was sie mal waren... aber ein paar Pfennig für nen Segen sind nun auch wirklich nicht teuer sondern eher ein echt fairer Preis.

Eine holprige Straße aus Sand führt am unregelmäßigen Ufer entlang, zwischen verfallenen Hütten führen Wege zum Fluss. Männer mit Holzkarren verkaufen Plastikbehälter für das
Bazar in Old Vrindavan
Yamuna-Wasser. Ich achte auf diejenigen, die mit einem gefüllte Kanister zurückkommen: der enthält eine dreckige, dunkelbraune Brühe. Und doch stört das hier niemanden.

Der Fluss ist heilig und was heilig ist, ist gut. Man nimmt das Nass mit heim, oder badet gar darin. Man ist fest davon überzeugt, dass es gut tun wird. Im ""Krishna boat"" wird man hinüber gefahren, auch das soll gut fürs Karma sein.

Ich wandere weiter und dann passiert noch etwas Tolles. Eine kleine, schneeweiße Kuh nähert sich mir unbemerkt von hinten und stupst mir mit der Nase in die Seite!!!

Eine Frau verbeugt sich lächelnd und ein Mann, der vorbeigeht sagt: ""greeting from Lord Krishna!"" Das ist wohl was ziemlich tolles und ich bin schon wieder versöhnt mit dem Land. Soooo niedlich! Und wie konnte diese Kuh so strahlend weiß bleiben?!

Normalerweise ist es so, dass man die Kuh berührt, an der Stirn oder an der Seite mit der flachen Hand, um sich den Segen zu holen. Ich bin irgendwie gerührt, dass die Kuh so freundlich war, mich von sich aus zu stupsen.

Mit der Riksha in den Ashram

Weiter gehe ich, doch mir tun schon die Füße weh.
""meine"" Stupskuh
Da sehe ich eine Rikscha, die von einem Halbstarken geputzt wird, und als er ruft, ob ich mit will, bleibe ich sofort stehen. Das ist meine! Der Junge hat saubere Sachen an und findet es ganz toll, eine europäische ""madam"" zu kutschieren.

Bevor er losfährt hupt er so lang, bis drei andere Jungs aus einer Hütte schauen und anerkennend johlen. Ich finde das lustig und lächle, woraufhin der Junge vorn auf dem Rad während er fährt, seinen Balztanz beginnt. Furchtbare Schnalzgeräusche, die mir schon in Delhi hinterhertönten, und dauerndes Posieren.

Du sollst fahren, denke ich und frage mich, bin ich jetzt gerade das moderne Äquivalent einer eitlen Besatzerlady, stelle ich mich bloß an, oder ist er wirklich ein Idiot? Ich entscheide mich dafür, dass ich auch in dieser anders tickenden Kultur kein Freiwild bin und damit für den Idioten. Und dafür, dass er harmlos sein wird.

Die Strecke ist weit, sandig und voller Schlaglöcher. Der Junge muss ordentlich treten und - natürlich! - hupen, auch wenn hier auf dem Schotterweg kaum ein anderes Gefährt im Weg ist. Er hat durchaus Zeit, sich immer wieder durch die schwarzen Haare zu fahren. Jaja, alles klar, Du denkst, dass Du
Yamuna river
gut aussiehst... Wenn schon, dann versteck wenigstens die dunkelgelben, schlechten Zähne. Aber auch mit gutem Gebiss tendierten seine Chancen gen Null.

In einer engen Gasse müssen wir stehen bleiben, weil ein Ochsenkarren den Weg versperrt, von dem frischgrüne Pflanzenbündel abgeladen werden. Das dauert und der hormongesteuerte Jüngling plustert die magere Brust auf soweit er kann. Er setzt sich in Pose, greift sich an die Gürtelschnalle, ruckt dreimal kräftig daran und fährt sich mit der Hand über den Schritt. Ignorieren, denke ich mir, er ist gar nicht da.

Das gefällt ihm nicht und er ruft ich weiß nicht was in den nächsten Hauseingang. Zwei Frauen erscheinen und lachen, ob über ihn oder mich kann ich kaum sagen. Die eine ist begeistert von meinen roten Haaren, die andere will meine Schuhe haben. Sie reibt die Finger aneinander, er übersetzt ""money"". Klar, das Wort kennt er, man lernt zuerst die wirtschaftlich wichtigen Begriffe, wie wäre es mit Höflichkeiten oder smalltalk, der Gast würde sich viel wohler fühlen ...

Nun, das ist vermutlich auch von mir kurz gedacht, denn wenns ums Leben an der Armutsgrenze geht, sieht man das sicher eher praktisch und reduziert den Service auf das Notwendigste. Aber ich
Bad im heiligen Fluss
schüttele den Kopf, auf gar keinen Fall gebe ich meine Fußbekleidung her und auf gar keinen Fall könntet Ihr den Gegenwert von 89 Euro für grad neu gekaufte Leicht-Trekkingschuhe zahlen.

Dann ist der Ochsenkarren endlich abgeladen und ich werde an meinen Zielort gefahren. Ich bin sehr müde und es reicht mir ernsthaft. Diese Kultur, so wie ich sie gerade in mich aufnehme, strengt wahnsinnig an.

Der Abend wird kühl, ich friere in meinem Zimmer und bin froh um meinen Schlafsack, meinem heimeligen Kokon, und wäre so gern in meinem eigenen Zuhause. Das Heimweh setzt ein, als ich schlafen will. Ein nie gekanntes, ganz elementares Gefühl, das mich einfach nur umhaut. Keine Ahnung, wie ich damit umgehen soll. Alles in allem war der Tag doch okay... Warum jetzt das?

Aus dem Tempel nebenan klingen beruhigende Mantras ins Zimmer. Langsam wird mir warm und ich schlafe irgendwann ein.

Ich bin also in Agra. Na toll. Da wollte ich erst nächste Woche hin. Beim Blick nach außen verliere ich allerdings sofort die Lust, nochmal herzukommen: Alles voller DAGL.

Ich war verloren - das Gefühl kannte ich so noch nicht. Ich missbrauche das Handy (das böse Roamingmonster lässt grüßen, ich freue mich leise auf die Handyrechnung) für die Suche nach einer Mietwagenstation. Die nächste von Sixt: New Delhi... Der Wahn. Eine übergreifende car rental-Website wirft in Agra einen dubiosen Anbieter aus für 125 Euro, normalerweise kostet das pro Tag um die 30. Ist aber auch keine Adresse angegeben. Grmpf.

Da hält der Bus am Straßenrand, wir sind offentsichtlich am Ziel der anderen angekommen. Der Guide erklärt was auf Hindi zum Taj Mahal und zu zwei anderen Monumenten, die die Gruppe ansehen will.

Unser personal guide

Dann taucht ein weiterer Guide auf. Er soll mir und Julie helfen. Immerhin das scheint irgendjemand organisiert zu haben, ich bin fast ein bisschen erstaunt. Ich frage ihn sofort nach einem Mietwagen, er sagt, der Bus bringt mich. Ich sage nein, der fährt ja erst heute Abend, ich will ein Auto. Er wiederholt, der Bus bringt mich. Wenigstens ein Taxi? Kein Durchkommen
UploadedFile20
mit meinen zarten Vorstellungen.

""first you hear my plan"", sagt er und legt den dar: Er will uns mit einem VIP-Ticket zum Taj Mahal bringen, während wir das ansehen, würde er für Julie ein Zugticket für den Zug nach Delhi organisieren, uns dann ""some other nice small places in Agra"" zeigen, dann gäbe es ein kleines Dinner, und ich solle wieder zu diesem Bus gebracht werden, der mich auf dem Rückweg dann wirklich in Vrindavan rauslässt.

Ich sage nochmal, dass ich nur eine Fahrt nach Vrindavan brauche, auch bereit wäre zunzahlen, obwohl ich ja den Bus schon gezahlt habe. Das ist aber nicht sein Plan, so ein Pech aber auch. ""I am guide to Agra, that is my work. You are my guests, I take care of you. You trust me. Only 300 rupees transport. I show you Taj Mahal, I bring you Vrindavan, I bring you Delhi."" Sagt er. Sag ich: ""I will go to the Taj next week, can't you get me a driver to Vrindavan now?"".

Er ist beleidigt, zuckt mit den Schultern und sagt: ""you get out, your choice"". Okay... Das ändert die Lage schlagartig.

Julie und ich beraten uns kurz und
UploadedFile21
sie will das Taj Mahal unbedingt noch sehen, ich denke, ok, dann hab ich eine Station auf der Liste schon abgehakt. ""does the bus really wait for me?"" frage ich (Mensch, Rauke, entspann dich mal, aber es geht nicht...) und ich merke dass der Guide die letzte Stufe vorm Bockigsein einschaltet: Er wird seeehr freundlich und ruhig. ""you trust me. no problem.""

Ich habe das Gefühl, bei der nächsten Frage direkt ausgesetzt zu werden, aber auch, hier noch was in Sachen Vertrauen lernen zu können. Und nachdem das heute früh am Ende auch gut ausging - warum nicht auch diese Situation?

Wir willigen ein. Julie braucht den Guide sowieso, um ein Zugticket zu bekommen. Und kaum hat er uns rumgekriegt, wird er zum freundlichen, lächelnden Begleiter.

In Agra

""you get out"" tönt der Busfahrer ungeduldig. Das machen wir und schon ist die Karre mit meinem Backpack abgefahren. Ohne den Guide finde ich den Bus nie wieder. Super. Wieder habe ich keine Wahl, und immerhin bekommen ein privates Tuktuk und der Fahrer ist ein wirklich netter Mensch.

Kurz freue ich mich aufs Taj Mahal, doch bei der Aufforderung ""you give me 750 rupees for premium ticket
UploadedFile22
taj mahal. you and you."" Schnell merken wir, Gast sein heißt auch wirklich nur, einen Guide zu haben. Wer erwartete, das sei eine Wiedergutmachung von der Busgesellschaft, oder gar eine Einladung zu irgendetwas, war komplett auf dem Holzweg.

Ich muss definitiv lernen, dass mein übliches Denkmuster mich hier nicht weiterbringt, merke aber dass mein Dickkopf sich auch nicht gängeln lassen will. Fremde Kultur hin oder her, ich mag mich wohlfühlen und so wird das gewiss nichts.

Der Guide kauft die Tickets, wir parken direkt neben dem Abwasserkanal am Straßenrand, Julie schließt die Augen und verkriecht sich soweit wie möglich hinter die Fahrzeugwand. Der Gestank dringt aber auch bis zu meiner Seite, dazu kommen Kinder und Bettler an unser Tuktuk. Der Fahrer hilft, sie abzuwehren. Blöder DAGL.

Taj Mahal

Das Taj Mahal habe ich fast vergessen. Erst als wir uns in die Schlange für ""foreign ladies"" einreihen, wird mir klar, dass jetzt happy sightseeing angesagt ist. Für die ganze Welt ist dieses Monument, ein Geschenk und schließlich Grabstätte für Mumtaz, die Lieblingsfrau eines früheren indischen Herrschers, der Wahnsinn. Hin und wieder blitzte das auch auf.

Das war schon schön, groß und erhaben. Ich hätte es nur
UploadedFile23
so gern in meinem eigenen Tempo und in halbwegs entspannter Stimmung gesehen! Vielleicht sogar im Abendlicht. Oder einen Guide genommen, der noch etwas dazu erklärt hätte (unserer musste ja weg, das Zugticket für Julie holen). Ach, meckermecker... 😉

Aber ehrlich gesagt, war es nicht ganz so überwältigend und zumindest an diesem Tag, zu dieser Stunde ein von unheimlich vielen Menschen überfüllter Ort, ein Tourispektakel, durch das man von Militäraufsehern auf vorgeschriebenen Pfaden durchgejagt wird...

Beeindruckend ja, groß auch, Zauber und Gänsehaut eher nicht... Ich war vermutlich echt nicht ""in Stimmung"". Aber ich hab's gesehen und mir reicht das auch so. Haken dran! Ich habe eine Station weniger auf dem Reiseplan, das ist auch okay.

Vertrauen ist alles

Ich war unserem Guide ziemlich dankbar, dass er uns betreut und gut auf unsere Sachen aufgepasst hat, die wir nicht mit ins Taj nehmen durften (Julie und ich hatten jeder ein iPad dabei, dann waren da noch meine Reisescheck-Quittungen, die im Zweifel auch was wert sind). Ich hatte zwischenzeitlich nur noch Kamera, Handy, Reisepass, Geld und Reiseschecks bei mir (im Taj kam mir zum ersten Mal der wohlig-warme Gedanke, dass ich damit einfach wieder nach Hause fliegen könnte).
UploadedFile24

Er hätte sich unsere Habseligkeiten locker schnappen und abhauen können, wir hätten ihn und den Bus nie wieder gefunden. Vertrauen ist alles.

Insgesamt aber war es ungeplantes Geldausgeben: 300 rupees für das Tuktuk, 750 Eintritt fürs Taj Mahal (mitnichten ein VIP-ticket, das war das ganz normale, teure Foreigner-Ticket), 350 für ein lausiges Essen in einem möchtegernguten Restaurant, 200 für den Guide. Und die ""other small nice places"" entpuppten sich als Läden, in denen wir einkaufen sollten.

Ich war in der Tourifalle gelandet, die ich hasse wie die Pest. Dann die enttäuschten und angefressenen Gesichter überall, als wir weder Schmuck, noch Wandbehänge, noch Figuren, noch Marmorzeug kaufen. Der Guide ließ die Schultern hängen, und tat mir fast ein bisschen leid, aber das half ja nichts.

Tourischwachsinn. Aber da prallten einfach zwei Unbekannte aufeinander, wem würde es helfen, das zu thematisieren.

Wieder am Bus

Tatsächlich brachte der Guide mich zum Bus und erklärte dem Fahrer, dass er mich in Vrindavan rauslassen sollte. Ich sagte, das sei ja nun abends und im Dunkeln, ob er noch jemanden dorthin bestellen könnte, der mich zum guesthouse bringen würde. Als er sagte ""no problem"", wusste ich irgendwie, da würde niemand stehen.

Ich hatte keine Kraft mehr, zu argumentieren und nachzufragen, also verabschiedeten wir uns und er fuhr mit Julie in das Gewühl von Agra.

Ich setzte mich in den Bus. Diesmal ganz vorne hin und ich würde genau aufpassen und zehnmal fragen und noch höllischer nerven als auf der Hinfahrt. Ich musste grinsen, die Armen... 😉

Halb acht abends. Wenn der Bus den Streckenabschnitt Agra-Mathura wieder vergleichsweise schnell fahren könnte wie auf dem Hinweg, müsste ich gegen 21, max. 22 Uhr Uhr in Vrindavan sein. Ich rief wieder im guesthouse an, dass es spät würde. Die Antwort ""no problem"" war nie so willkommen wie jetzt, aber ob das stimmte, wusste ich mittlerweile nicht mehr. Vielleicht stand ich dann auch allein im Nirgendwo.

Doch der Plan wurde schnell durchkreuzt, erst ging es in Agra noch zu einem Outlet, in dem die Reisegruppe einkaufen sollte. Das tat sie, etwa eine Stunde lang. Dann ging es weiter, nach kurzer Zeit noch ein Stop, ""sweets typical for Agra"" probieren und kaufen. Mir war mittlerweile alles egal und versuchte ein bisschen zu schlafen.

Wieder auf dem Highway

Juhuuu, endlich fuhr der Bus und tatsächlich bog er nach gut einer Stunde in Höhe Vrindavan ab. Doch schon im ersten Straßenzug eine Festgemeinde, man sang und tanzte, kleine geschmückte Wagen waren auf der Straße.

Ich hatte keine Laune mehr, das als sehenswerte lustige Abwechslung zu sehen, ich hatte nur Sorge, dass er umkehren und weiter nach Delhi fahren würde. Doch der Busfahrer hupte sich durch (da waren die Hupen mal echt sinnvoll!). Meter für Meter quälte er sich an den Festwagen vorbei.

Danach überquerte er langsam klappernd und wackelnd einen Bahnübergang, an dem die Schranke zwar geöffnet, aber das rote Licht noch nicht erloschen war. Ich bekam zum zweiten Mal an diesem Tag echte Angst und hoffte, das jetzt kein Zug anrauschte. Am Ende ging alles gut.

Wieder ein Halt. Ich zeigte dem Busfahrer die Adresse meines guesthouse, er nickte nur und zückte sein Telefon und stieg aus. Was auch immer er da telefonieren musste...

Gerade wollte ich meinen Rucksack aufschnallen, da stiegen wie auf Kommando die anderen Fahrgäste aus. Ich fragte einen der Fußballjungs, warum, er meinte: ""there is temple. we visit."" Ich ließ mich auf den Sitz fallen, nicht wissend, was zu tun war.

Der Busfahrer war nirgends zu sehen, und als er und alle anderen wieder einstiegen, meinte er ""vrindavan next place"". Aha. Hättste auch vorhin kurz sagen können. 22:40 Uhr und ich war immer noch nicht da, wo ich sein wollte.

Vrindavan!

Tatsächlich war Vrindavan nur noch 10 Minuten entfernt, und der Busfahrer fuhr genau bis zum Ortseingang, dem riesigen, schön heimelig beleuchteten Bhaktivedanta Swami Gate.

Grad wollte ich es wunderwunderbar finden, da hielt er an und sagte ""you walk"". Okay, muss wohl ...

Untypisch für meine bisherigen Erfahrungen mit Indien, sah ich tatsächlich keinen einzigen Menschen und kein Tuktuk. Ich ging etwas weiter ins Ortsinnere und hoffte auf eine Fahrradrikscha, aber ich sah für mehrere Minuten keine einzige. Ausgerechnet, wenn ich Begleitung wollte, gabs keine. Super.

Überhaupt war es hier ziemlich ruhig, nur sphärische Musik drang aus dem Tempel zu meiner rechten heran. Ich freute mich, dass ich wohl tatsächlich Ruhe fand, die ich mir gewünscht hatte.

Ich wählte mit dem letzten Akkubalken meines Handys das guesthouse an - Mailbox. Schluck. Darin mischte sich leichte Verzweiflung, weil ich irgendwo auf der Welt auf einer dunklen Straße stand und nicht wusste, wie ich zu meinem guesthouse komme.

Da war doch noch eine zweite Nummer... Ich wühlte nach der Buchungsbestätigung, als ein Junge mit einer Fahrradrikscha neben mir hielt, bei ihm drei weitere Jungs zwischen 10 und 14. Die Adresse kannte er nicht, also rief ich schnell die zweite Nummer im Guesthouse an, es ging jemand ran und beschrieb den Jungs den Weg.

Fünf Minuten später war ich endlich da! Das guesthouse mit Ashram war wunderschön, empfing mich warm und freundlich trotz meiner Verspätung, das Zimmer war gut, ich hörte von dem nahegelegenen Tempel Krishna-Gesänge, die wahnsinnig beruhigten.

Mir fielen sämtliche Steine vom Herzen und ein paar Tränen der Anspannung lösten sich. Ich schlief elf Stunden durch.

Taj Mahal - Porte Sud
13 février 2012_Agra

Me voilà déjà réconciliée avec l’Inde ! Le Taj Mahal est simplement malade, beau, grandiose, majestueux. C’est jusqu’ici le plus beau et impressionnant monument architectural que j’ai visité. Dire que c’est un tombeau… Et oui, un empereur a fait construire cette mausolée de marbre blanc pour sa 2e femme décédée en 1631, aidé par quelques 20 000 ouvriers qui y ont travaillé pendant 30 ans.

Les détails sont principalement composés de bas-relief dans le marbre, de pierres précieuses incrustées dans le marbre (même dans les surfaces courbes) formant des fleurs ou des récits du Coran (tel qu’autour de la porte d’entrée) et de dentelles de marbre. D’ailleurs, des maîtres sont même venus d’Europe pour sculpter celles-ci.

Petite anecdote : Phil et moi se levons à 6h30 am pour voir le levé du soleil sur le Taj Mahal, l’entrée du site ouvrant à 7h am. Mais les femmes n’ont pas pu entrer avant 8h am parce que c’est la prière musulman dans la Mosquée adjacente au Taj Mahal. D’ailleurs, on doit enlever nos souliers dans tous les temples (donc on ajoute des bas au papier de toilette dans la sacoche) et être habillé en long. Et
Taj Mahal - et moi
pas de démonstration d’affection, même si les hommes eux se promènent main dans la main !

Nous avons ensuite visité le Fort d’Agra qui est aussi très beau. Le souci du détail était encore au rendez-vous, en plus des singes ! C’était la première fois que j’en voyais autant en liberté, dans les arbres, sur le sol, ou grimpant sur le fort. Il y avait aussi beaucoup de petits perroquets vert lime (ou grosses perruches, comme vous voulez…). Pour beaucoup (trop) d’Indiens, ont faisaient aussi partis des attractions touristiques du site. On a dû être pris en photo 25 fois… Ils disent qu’on ressemble à des movie star … n’importe quoi ! Mais j’avoue que moi aussi je me suis gâtée, incognito, j’ai immortalisé plein de femmes en sari. Je développe vraiment une obsession pour ce vêtement en soie, tellement coloré et brillant.. je pars une nouvelle mode au Québec !

Demain nous mettons le cap au Ranthambore National Parc, pour une promenade dans la jungle à la recherche de tigres ! Première expérience de train demain, départ à 4h30 am ...

Bref, Bonne nuit !

LN

L'Indiennerie du jour : essayer de nous vendre
Taj Mahal - romantique !
un guide pour les trains 550 Rs alors qu'on l'a achete a 35 Rs.. n'importe quoi !

CIMG0683
We extended our stay in Hampi by another 4 nights. We had met so many nice people that we didn't want to leave. We also changed our plans to go to Kanha national park as it was too much effort to get there and very expensive. Hopefully we will see some tigers somewhere else.

When we booked our tickets to Varanasi everyone told us that it's winter in the north and that it will be cold. I asked the agent how cold and he told me European temperatures. We did get a bit worried because we don't have any suitable clothes. When I checked the forecast online it said it will be around 25C during the day and between 15 and 17C at night. It seems that anything under 35 is cold for Indians. The locals here walk around with winter jackets, hats/earmuffs and scarves - it's really not that bad - a jumper will do.

The journey here was very long and we left on 3 February by sleeper bus (9 hours) to Hyderabad and then took a train from there to Varanasi (28 1/2 hours). We arrived in Varanasi on 5 February. I was really worried about
CIMG0454
the night bus as I am not a fan of them and I try to avoid them by all means due to previous experience. This one was acutally quite good. It was a proper sleeper with beds, pillows and blankets and we did get some sleep. The train journey was good. It's long but we never get bored. The night was horrible though because two of the windows near our beds wouldn't shut and it got really cold. Everyone was wrapped up in their blankets trying to shut the windows and trying to sleep. We are still exhausted from the travelling.

We found a lovely room in a guesthouse with a balcony overlooking the Ganges. Exactly what we wanted and it was the first room we looked at. They only have one room and the restaurant that's above it is one of the best in Varanasi. Very handy! And we have wifi!!!!!!

Varanasi is a holy city for the Hindus and people all over India travel here to die and be cremated. The cremations are done at the ghats. The ghats are the stairs leading down to the Ganges. There are two burning ghats - a smaller one
CIMG0462
that's near ours and then the big main burning ghat. You have to be prepared to see things you might not want to see. Corpses get burned here 23 hours a day, every day. The people get burned on different levels with the higher casts on the top one and the lowest by the Ganges. They bring the dead down to the ghat, put them in the Ganges for a short while so they are covered in the water and then prepare them to be burned. The wood for this will be weight up on big scales. Some of the corpses are being brought down with their feet and heads not covered so it can be a bit of a shock. It is interesting to see though how openely people deal with the death and the cremations here in Varanasi. Only men are allowed at the cremations because women cry too much (so I was told) and in previous years the women threw themselves onto the fires out of desperation of losing the main breadwinner. The interesting thing is that the family members hardly show any emotions - there is certainly no open crying. Not everyone gets burned. Children, pregnant
CIMG0537
women and people who died of snakebites are put in the Ganges straight away. The ashes of all the burnt people also go in the Ganges. People try to make money out of it though. You can watch the procedures but it's very likely that a 'guide' will approach you and ask you to follow him to a place where you are 'allowed' to watch. You will get a little talk and then they ask you to make a donation in US dollars. This donation so they tell you (and the Lonely Planet says the same) goes towards the wood that the family has to buy for the burning. I don't quite believe this. You also shouldn't take any pictures, which is obvious but if you pay 10 Euros then you are allowed. Some of the 'guides' get quite agressive and ask you to move on because you already spent too much time watching or come up with some other made up story. If nothing works then they will try and get you to donate to one of the hospices where the people come to die. If that fails then they'll try the thing about the silk factories. It's pretty sad that people try and make money out of this.

I was glad that I went to the smaller burning that first - it's not as 'commercial' there and I did get some interesting information there without paying. This could be because I had to make a quick exit after realising that the wind started blowing ashes all over us.....

As you can imagine, the Ganges is very polluted but people still bath in it, wash their clothes and brush their teeth. At one place dead people swim around and in the other people use it for washing. It's pretty cross but they believe that because it is a holy river it will wash away a life of sins. Our guesthouse guy offered to wash our clothes but I declined his offer..... I am also avoiding the chai sellers on the river.....better save than sorry.

Once you walk away from the river you get to a maze of alleyways called 'galis'. It's very interesting to walk around them. They are like a bazaar but you don't get hassled like in Egypt or Morocco and you see all sorts of shops. It's very easy to get lost there and you end up walking in circles or in the completely wrong direction.

The first night we decided to go to McDonalds at the IP Mall. We really fancied one - but a McDonalds without beef just isn't right. Anyways, we ask an autorickshaw to take us there and he wanted far too much money so we took a cycle rickshaw. They are clearly not made for western people as we couldn't fit our bums on the seat next to each other. The guy also seemed to struggle quite a lot. We decided to walk back from there as it isn't very far but got hoplessly lost!

Varanasi is very interesting and it was one of the places I really wanted to go and I am very glad we did. It is very dirty though and the smell can get too much at times. You have the usual animals roaming the streets and the ghats and they just pee and poo everywhere but so do the people. I thought that the smell of the burning people must be horrible but you don't smell that at all. They put some powder in so it doesn't smell.

I can highly recommend to everyone who wants to visit India to stop over in Varanasi! Just don't get ripped off!

We are here until 9 February when we will take a train to Delhi for our last 3 days in India.

Bannerghatta to Fatehpur Sikri


Mirror mirror on the wall whose the most beautiful
Agra
As we prepared to depart Bannerghatta, I look back over our week here and feel some sadness that we are leaving. This was a pilot program and as such disorganised at times, the accommodation wasn’t perfect as we were confined to the lodge compound between 5.30pm and dawn which meant no visits to Bangalore or anywhere else for that matter in the evenings. The food was not bad and there was plenty of it, but at times it was a little boring and I tired of it by week’s end, still after all that we both had a great time. These Sloth Bears have been around human’s all their lives and as such are less aloof than the Sun Bear of Cambodia and often friendly despite their suffering at human hands. Finally the weather here is dry like Adelaide which we much preferred to that of South East Asia and we had a large group of volunteers to socialise with whereas at Phnom Tamao we were alone.

On our last morning we were woken by screaming kids at around 5.30am, asking the teachers to quieten them down was just a waste of time. Sue and Keith left at 9.30am to

The road to Agra
return to Sydney we followed at 11.30am due to the horrible traffic congestion we headed straight to the airport arriving around 2pm while the others who were staying another week went into town to shop and have dinner. The airport is modern and has clean toilets, check in was efficient but strangely they have separate departure gates for men and women, still we were on the bus to our aircraft by 4pm and arrived in Delhi on schedule even though our flight was delayed departing.

The climate in Delhi was much cooler so it was fortunate that our driver Jitu and his boss Asif were waiting for us at the arrivals gate; Asif speaks French with an English accent which is very peculiar. It took quite some time to find our hotel but eventually we arrived around 8pm and enjoyed the buffet dinner before Ruth had herself a hot bath. I woke early and headed to the gym to work out in the little exercise room, it always makes me feel better, then off to breakfast, where we gorged ourselves silly because it was included in the room price and we had no idea when we would eat again.
The stunning tomb of deceased Mughal Emporer Akbar
Agra


At 9.30am we loaded up the car and set off for Agra, after nearly four hours of chaotic drivers, rubbish, more rubbish, animals wandering everywhere while enshrouded in a smog cloud hundreds of square kilometres in diameter we finally arrived. The first think of note we saw when entering Agra was the wonderful red sandstone and marble tomb of Akbar, the greatest of India’s Mughal Emperors. It was a stunning compound which included beautiful gardens, stunning gate houses and the tomb itself made of red sandstone and marble inlay was spectacular. There were also some very cute chipmunks and a small heard of blackbuck antelope living in the gardens.

The hotel was our next port of call Jitu suggesting one that was average but clean enough, they bragged of the great views of the Taj Mahal from the roof so I went up to have a look and was attacked by a couple of Rhesus Monkeys, this wasn’t why we didn’t stay here that was the fault of the hotel manager who tried to charge me an exorbitant price for his rooms, I called him a cheat and stormed out. We eventually checked in to a much more
Beautiful islamic arches
Agra
reasonably priced place down the street then headed straight out to the Taj Mahal, you can only go so close in a vehicle so Jitu parked in the car park nearby. Here we were told we would have to get a rickshaw which was Rs200, another guy got in the front with the driver which seemed strange at the time, the rickshaw then travelled a couple of hundred metres down the road and stopped at the ticket office where the guy in the front guide started following me to the ticket office, I told him to get lost, we purchased a very expensive ticket to get in and then returned to the rickshaw where we were told we would have to walk the rest of the way, what a scam we could have walked in the first place for nothing. We arrived at the entrance of the tomb complex the impressive thirty metre high gatehouse a short time later.

The first sight of the Tah Mahal once described as “a tear drop on the face of eternity” is breathtaking it’s like a jewel glittering in the sun, but then you notice the thousands of people crawling all over everything
The size of the tomb is impressive
Agra
like ants and remember how much crowds can irritate, still not even all those ignorant Indians pushing their way into the foreigner’s line bothered me very much this day as I was just as eager as everyone else to get up on that marble plateau and see the tombs interior. I slid the paper covers over my shoes so that my sandals wouldn’t damage the marble and joined the small foreigners queue to the left of the mausoleums entrance, photography is not allowed inside but that did not deter the Indian’s in the least, as they clicked away, such ignorant and stupid people.

This amazing example of a grieving Emperor Shah Jahan’s love for his dead queen Mumtaz Mahal is depicted in the colourful floral inlays, the carved marble lattice and the many other stunning carvings inscribed in its walls. The interior is also intricately carved but it was also unpleasantly crowded and hot and I was keen to see the Cenotaph of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan and get out into the “fresh” air. After walking around the building admiring the lovely view of the Yamuna River and the forty metre high minarets at each of the buildings four

Agra
corners we strolled back the way we had come through the ornamental gardens (charbagh), stopping from time to time to steal occasional glances of the tomb before passing through the equally awed persons taking their first glance at “the embodiment of all things pure” (Rudyard Kipling). We then passed through that wonderful gateway and the splendour of the Taj Mahal was lost as we returned to the madness of India.

On arriving back at the rickshaw I attempted to pay the driver the agreed price, as we had decided to stroll back to the car, his response was to demand double, I refused and walked off with Ruth at my side. Everybody in Agra has tried to cheat me at least once, nobody will answer a question or offer assistance without sticking out a hand for payment, I was really angry with our driver for not warning us about these scammers.

The next day we rose with the dawn and were at the Red Fort by 8.30am, that was a great move as the place was empty and we had it pretty much to ourselves, the fort has walls up to twenty metres high and 2.5 kilometres in

circumference. The structure was originally built by Akbar for military purposes in 1565, but was later transformed into a palace by Shah Jahan using his favourite building material, marble. After passing through the Amar Singh Gate the only current entrance to the complex we passed by the Pearl Mosque on our way to the unbelievable ornate and stunning palace complex. The beautifully carved buildings and the stunning views of the river and the Tah Mahal in the distance were also a wonderful surprise, for over an hour we wandered through a stunning maze of beautiful buildings. When we finally finished being totally awestruck we walked through the exit gate all smiles to be confronted by an example of India’s uglier side, a terribly disabled man begging near the entrance gate, I gave him some money as we passed.

It was now time to leave Agra and visit the ancient fortified city of Fatehpur Sikri which lies about forty kilometres west of Agra, built by Akbar it was for a time the capital of the Mughal Empire. Our driver dropped us at the bus station where we had to board a bus to the complex, the bus passed through the
Intricately carved marble lattice
Agra
Agra Gate before depositing us at the ticket building where we paid for our ticket before entering the Pachisi Courtyard to be greeted with the lovely red sandstone Treasury building and the Astrologers Kiosk with its carved serpentine ceiling. We then visited the ornately carved palaces, one of which belonged to each of Akbar’s three wives, the stables and then on to massive Jama Majid entering via the Shahi Darwaza or the Kings Gate. Here I entered the marble tomb of Shaikh Salim Chishti a Sufi saint honoured by Akbar and the adjacent tomb of his grandson Islam khan, Ruth waited outside with my sandals. The Tomb of Chishti was intricately carved and quite attractive, I thought it was worth a look until someone hit me on the head with a stick as I headed for the exit, probably because I didn’t give them any money. We then crossed the courtyard exiting though the Buland Darwaza or the Victory Gate admiring the massive bee hives hanging from the ceiling arches before boarding a bus back to the car park and our vehicle.

AC Tier 2 Sleeper Class
Mum - beautiful, Taj - crowned, Mahal - palace.

So, Mum Taj Mahal, beautiful crowned palace. Understand ?

But first, the train journey. Approx 600km overnight, 12 hours in an AC Tier 2 Sleeper Class, price of ticket, about 12 quid.

On this particular train, this was the best class available.

Ahem.

Beds are arranged in compartments of four ( two bunks ) down one side, and two lengthways down the other. Curtains separate you from the corridor.

So, how was the trip ?

Well, I'm glad you asked me that. It was . . . . interesting. We met some nice people, and we met some mice people. The nice people were two Chinese girls who were travelling in India for a couple of weeks and spoke very good English ( though only one was sleeping our compartment, the other was further down the train. The fourth person, an Indian gentleman, didn't join us until about midnight ). The mice people (mice really) were small and scruffy, with long hair. In fact, these were the scruffiest mice I have ever seen. I said to Moi perhaps they were hippy mice. When I first
Our Beds for the Night
saw them scuttle across the floor, I shouted “mice” and the two Chinese girls screamed, jumped up on the bunks, put their shoes back on and promptly went to bed. I was tempted to keep shouting mice just to see what happened, but didn't.

So, we bunked down for the night (both top bunks were ours). No sleep really, but restful listening to the clackety-clack of the train. Later, I could smell a strange odour and heard some small squeaking noises. Perhaps it was the hippy mice smoking ganja and breaking out into fits of mouse-hilarity. But no, it turned out to simply be the Indian gentlemen below me, breaking wind and gently snoring.

Wind forward 12 hours, 5am we arrive and are met at the station. A short while later, we are checked into a really nice hotel, shower and snooze. On waking, we could see the Taj Mahal from our window !! Fantastic.

Turns out the Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays ( the mosque there is still in use, and Friday is Islam’s Sunday ), so we were taken to a 16th century abandoned city 25 km out of Agra. All in red sandstone,
Toilet Feet
this is an amazing place. Built by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1570, it was abandoned only 12 years later due to lack of water. He was very tolerant of other cultures and religions and so the place is influenced by Hindu, Islam and Christian design features. Of great interest to me was a red stone where convicted murderers would be executed by having their heads stamped on by an elephant.

Next day we visited the Taj Mahal. It is true. No picture can do it justice, you just have to come here to experience its beauty. What an amazing sight. You go up close and there are intricate carvings and semi-precious mosaics all over it. Inside ( no pictures inside please ) is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal ( the third wife of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan ) which is even more intricately decorated. Beautiful floral designs made up of 100 semi precious stones inlaid into the white marble, about 3 inches across, adorn the whole thing. Each individual one took 50 days to complete and there’s loads of them. It took 22 years to build and involved over 20,000 workers. Apparently, Shah Jahan also wanted to build
View from our hotel window
an identical black one across the river for himself but died ( well actually, was overthrown and imprisoned by his own son for 8 years first ) before it was really started ( just the foundations remain ).

Spent some time sitting and soaking it up. Then on to see Agra red fort (interesting) and another monument (mini-Taj, also interesting) but nowhere near the beauty and majesty of the Taj itself. One last look from across the river then back to the hotel.

There’s lots of monkeys in Agra (simian and rhesus). At first it was a novelty, but you start to get rather passé about them after a while !!

Anyway, this is our last day in India. Tomorrow, we fly to Katmandu, Nepal. How to sum it all up ? Some poetry perhaps:

-o-

Oh Mother India,
Home to tea and rubber
Curried eggs and monkey’s legs
What are you to me ?

Oh Mother India,
Home to silk and flying carpets
Burning ghats and useful cow pats
What are you to me ?

It is almost as though
You are some strange third
Fatehpur Sikri
world.
Where poverty thrives in the shadow of palaces
And unusual Gods have unusual phalluses
What are you to me ?

Oh Mother India,
Home to idli and gulab jamun
Diddly, widdly, fruit and salmon.
What are you to me ?

All these things and more.

Would I return ?

Yes, I would.

Idli

-o-

And so as the sun sets on the first leg of our intrepid journey, how would I summarize these first 10 days?

Moo cows.

(Cue Indian music, repeat and fade)

Post script

Worst joke of the trip so far:

When driving through one of the towns, we came across a herd of baby goats in the way. The driver peeped his horn, but they didn’t move out of the way. “It’s not surprising”, I said, “they’re only kids”.

Best quote of the trip so far:

When walking up to Buddha’s cave, both Moi and I were quite out of breath when we reached the top. We were talking about this later and saying we really needed to get fit. “Perhaps we should walk up more
Honey Bees
hills”, I said. “Yes”, replied Moi, “Nepal, that should be hilly”.

Yes, I imagine Nepal will be a bit hilly.

Just thought I should let you know, I did try the steamed idli (diddly).

Q: So, first of all, what is it ?

A: Well, my siblings-in-law reliably inform me they are made of lentils and peas and are delicious. In which case, I'm not sure these are the same things. Don't know then is the short answer.

Q: OK - so what do they look like ?

A: Breast implants.

Totally white, convex disc shaped, about 4 inches in diameter. Rather like the flying saucers we used to get as kids.

Q: OK - so what do they taste like ?

A: Breast implants.

( In which case, I rather hope that they are made of the medically approved silica gel, the last thing I would want is to have to have my idlis surgically removed ).

For those of you who have never tasted breast implants, the nearest alternative I can think of is memeory foam ! ( Hey, have I just invented something here - ""memory breasts"" that retain the shape of your fingers after you've squeezed them?).

Anyway, I think you're supposed to have them with curry. I had them with honey. (If the Americans can have syrup on their sausages, I can have honey on my idlis - oo-er).

I don't think I'll be having them again.

P.S. Stool report - while we're on the subject, thought you might be interested to learn that our stools are still relatively normal, well formed with a firm consistency. I say relatively normal, that is apart from a particularly long, smooth one I did the other day that I swear swam away under its own steam (so to speak). Moi didn't seem too impressed when I came out of the bathroom, beaming and proud, saying: ""I've just done an eel"".

It seems our strategy is working. Sticking fastidiously to the rules (ie. cook it, peel it, or f*ck it) and disguising ourselves as vegetarians. Oh yes, that and cleaning our teeth with Coca-Cola and biscuits for toothpaste.

Agra
The Taj at sunrise
After the disappointment of Ranthambore, we took the train to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. Given all the hype we hoped that it too wouldn't be a let down. On the train we made friends with two cute kids, to whom the train seemed to be a big adventure playground, with them swinging around from bunk to bunk. Spending time drawing, colouring and reading with them, helped the journey pass quickly and really brightened up our day. They were soon calling us Auntie-ji and Uncle-ji.

Based on our experience of Jaipur, we decided to do things the easy way round in Agra and hired a rickshaw driver for the whole day. He picked us up at 5.30am and we headed to the Taj for sunrise. It was an extremely misty morning, and when we first glimpsed the Taj it appeared to be floating on a cloud. It was an awesome sight and every bit as beautiful as we had imagined. We were really glad we got up early to be there for sunrise, as even though there were hundreds of people there, it didn't feel too over crowded. We did see some amusing sights though...

From the Taj
Agra
we went on to Agra fort, and then to the Baby Taj and then in the evening we went to the gardens on the Yamuna river, from which there was an amazing view of the back of the Taj at sunset. This made the perfect end to our day.

After our busy day sightseeing, we had planned a relaxing evening before catching our 13 hour night train to Varanasi. However, our plans were derailed when we found out that our train was no longer passing through Agra and that we would have to travel 60km by taxi to another town to catch our train! Luckily we arrived early, as it took us 40 minutes to locate the right platform. We finally boarded the train and tucked ourselves in for the night, expecting to arrive in time for lunch by the Ganges. Unfortunately, our peaceful sleep was disturbed by a very loud American tourist demanding to know from us when we would arrive. Apparently the train had been stationary for several hours overnight, explaining our good night's rest. From our own quieter investigations, we learnt that the train was about 6 hours late, meaning we would be arriving in Varanasi
Agra
Built 1632-1653
for dinner, instead of lunch.

Varanasi, located on the banks of the Ganges, is a holy city for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Pilgrims come to the city to bathe in the holy river to wash away a lifetime of sins and to bring their relatives to be cremated on the ghats. It was amazing to see the pilgrims submerging themselves in the freezing cold water at dawn, especially given the fact that the river is incredibly polluted and in some places septic. In fact, samples of the water have shown it to have 1.5 million faecal coliform bacteria per 100ml (water safe for bathing should be less than 500 per 100ml!).

We enjoyed early morning and dusk boat trips up and down the river, watching the Ganga Aarti ceremony, lighting lotus candles and adding them to the hundreds of others floating past. The morning boat ride was an eery experience, as the river and town were shrouded in a thick fog. As a result, we could only hear, but not see, the mornings activities such as laughing yoga, bells from the temples, music from hawkers selling
Agra
Built by Emporer Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his third wife, who dies during the birth of their 14th child
CDs on the river and dhobi-wallahs pounding clothes to within an inch of their lives in the name of cleanliness on the washing stones. Based on our found knowledge of the state of the water, we chose not to have our clothes washed here...

Other than these boat trips, most of our time in Varanasi was spent relaxing and hiding away from the frenzy of India in a lovely cafe, eating delicious muffins and carrot cake and sipping freshly brewed earl grey and coffee. The cafe also had some tasteful handicrafts, unlike most of the tat we had seen in the streets and bazaars of other cities, so we decided to buy a few presents to send home to boost our flagging Christmas spirits. Another draw was that it had the cleanest toilet we had come across in all of India!

On The Way To Bodh Gaya
Phew !

We're actually in Agra now, with a beautiful view of the Taj Mahal from our hotel window.

But first, I wanted to tell you a bit more about Bodh Gaya.

If New Delhi is the London of North India, then I suppose Varanasi could be construed to be similar to the Holy City of Liverpool, then Bodh Gaya is the Clitheroe. There the similarity ends (if it ever started).

Not that I am suggesting that Clitheroe be a central site for holy pilgrims from all over the world, I'm talking size comparisons really.

The main site in Bodh Gaya is the Mahabodhi Temple which is built on the site that Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree when he achieved enlightenment. The tree (or at least a tree which is allegedly related to the original) is still there and Buddhist pilgrims come from all over the world. Some even come from as far away as Bilsborrow (though not convinced they're proper Buddhists).

The temple itself is mindblowing. A huge structure, 100-odd feet high, with ornate carvings housing a statue of Buddha. I have never seen anything like it in my life and it was
Buddha's Footprints
just amazing to be there and see it. In fact, the whole site is amazing, espcially at night when the whole area is lit up and you can hear the sound of Buddhist chanting. For me this has been one of the highlights of the trip so far. Truly mind-blowing and we returned a number of times to sit under the Bodhi tree and take in the atmosphere.

Outside the temple, there are lots of beggars, children, old people, crippled people. It is difficult to know what to do. We are told (by the guides) to ignore them as if you give money to the children, you propogate the idea that begging is a viable way to survive and they will do that rather than study. You also hear of adults purposefully crippling children to use them to beg, so again you don't want to propagate this. Also, there's just too many of them. Anyone who does give something just gets mobbed. Ignoring them just feels wrong (especially given the 8-fold path of Buddhism ie right attitude, right mindfulness etc etc) but you are left with no choice.

We were taken to an orphanage for the poorest children
The Bodhi Tree
and orphans from the area. Basically no more than a concrete shed with three bare concrete rooms. There were about 15 kids there who sang some songs for us. We gave them a generous donation (though still not sure if we were scammed, some investigtive journalism to do when we get home methinks) but it felt like the right thing to do under the circumstances.

The next day we saw some other sites, mainly temples, but one site that stood out was an 80-foot statue of Buddha. Fantastic.

Hotel was a bit crappy - not so clean, food a bit challenging. Didn't like it. Our guide was a nice enough guy ( I think ). Quite young, English not so good. For example, I asked him how old the Mahabodhi temple was and he said 26,000 years ago (so, when Mammoths roamed the Earth). Another example, we were walking down to the temple for evening prayers ( I know, I know ) and I noticed a bright star quite low down. As Jupiter was already high in the sky, I was wondering what it was and mentioned it to Moi. He asked me what I was talking about
Mahabodhi Temple
and I asked him if he knew. He said, ""Yes Sir, that's where the driver goes for a wash and does his toilets"".

Enough said.

But, he knew his way round. He also took us up a mountain to a cave which is again where Buddha stayed for 6 years and is also a place of pilgimage and worship.

But the place that will stay with us the most is the Mahabodhi Temple.

Next day we drove back to Varanasi to board an overnight train to Agra (arriving at 5:00am this morning). Now that was an experience in itself, but will be the subject of another entry.

Jaipur Pigeons
Me: ""Oh my Goshhhhh look they're so pretty!"" Mom: ""Shannon, if they shit on me, I swear to God I will kill you.""
Namaste 😊



It was not without reservations that I decided to go back to Jaipur and bring Mom along – those who read the blog from my last time there will know that it was not exactly my favourite city, and for reasons that I cannot quite put my finger on, other than that the hassle there seems to eclipse the hassle in other cities (yes, even in Pahar Ganj) and there is just a weirder vibe there that didn't sit well with me. It was, I think, the only city that I didn't feel connected to last time. But with the Jaipur Literature Festival on, and some pretty big-name and terrific authors there, I was ready to give the city a second chance and I learned why I was meant to go back, in the end...

Another 18-hour train journey, from Mumbai to Jaipur, that actually started off much more promisingly than other journeys, mainly due to the fact that our car was full of teenagers on a school trip, giggling and running from car to car, berth to berth, switching seats and saying “Hello” to us, rather than middle-aged men staring at us
Hawa Mahal
The palace the Maharaja of Jaipur built so his wives and mistresses could see the city without having to leave purdah (it might have saved him a couple dollars if he just let them out of the palace...)
unashamedly. The giggling got especially hysterical when a roll of toilet paper that Mom MADE me carry fell out of my purse and rolled down the centre aisle of the car – hahaha! But later that night, when I was awoken in the positively and legitimately bone-chilling cold at 3 a.m. (we were very ill-prepared for the temperature drop when we moved up into Rajasthan) by the giggles and chatter, and found that every single teenage boy on that trip was crammed into the girls' berths across from us, I was not thinking it was so great – I kept in mind, though, that Indian teens very rarely get unsupervised time together, and especially an overnight trip like this, so I kept my patience in check when I asked them to please be quieter or move somewhere else, and they were very nice and apologetic. I was, actually, happy to see loads of flirting and interacting going on and it was super sweet, and we enjoyed a sunrise chai with the girls, trying to warm ourselves up by wrapping our hands around the steaming paper cups.

Arriving in Jaipur, we managed to find a cheap guesthouse that was
Dr. Chopra
At the Lit Fest!
admittedly prison-cell-like, but it was a great price, and had hot water for 3 hours every morning (which is a huge bonus!), and I as usual unloaded every single bit of everything in my backpack, which for some reason I can't help but do every time I arrive somewhere and makes Mom so nuts that now when we go somewhere she designates a certain surface as “Shannon's” and one as “Mom's” in order to minimize the disorder. The day after we arrived we went to the first day of the Lit Fest and met up with Nick, an employee from Salaam Baalak Trust in Delhi, as well as two of the City Walk guides, and it was so awesome to see them all again outside of Delhi. The boys were taking part in a youth workshop at the Festival called Democracy Dialogues, talking about all the different issues relating to the pursuit of true democracy in India that I'll bet was really interesting (I couldn't go due to my not being a youth anymore, unfortunately). Mom and I went to a talk by Chetan Bhagat, a super SUPER popular young author here, whose popularity is pretty much equal to that
Annnnd Oprah
Just doing her thing.
of the author of the Twilight series of books (I may be reaching here, but he's pretty wicked). He talked about what inspires his stories, which are incredibly relevant to young adults inIndia, like corruption and working in the IT/call centre industry, and how he mixes these storylines up with a love story in order to make them readable. It was really interesting anyways, but even more so since I have read a couple of the books he was talking about.

Unfortunately, Mom got sick that night and stayed that way for the next few days, which was even more devastating since the following morning OPRAH was being featured at the Lit Fest and Mom was really, really, really, really looking forward to seeing her in person. I actually did not particularly care for her, but to appease Mom I went to the session, arriving only 2 hours early because I figured it'sIndia, who the hell knows or cares about Oprah here? Well, apparently lots of upper class women do, or at least the 2 very nice women I was sitting on the ground at the front of the stage with do, because they were going mental waiting
Next Level Absurdity
A goat, dressed up, waiting for the marble shop outside the Taj Mahal to open. It is almost too funny.
for her to come on, and when she did... I have to say, I was actually really impressed! I found her really likeable and really approachable, and being questioned about her impressions on India, she echoed so many of the things that I observed and continue to observe and absolutely LOVE about life here – the way that yes, traffic is chaotic, but there is an underlying flow to it that everyone here just gets into; that people here LIVE their spirituality and religion, every moment of every day and in everything that they do; that Indians respect and take care of their families in a way that is truly unique and exemplary; and that there is a sense of being a part of something bigger and more important than the individual here, that is difficult, I think, for someone coming from a Western background to accept at first but which I find very, very comforting after having spent so much time here.

The whole experience was pretty surreal – I sat in front of and met the freaking KING of Jodhpur, I bumped into William Dalrymple, one of my favourite authors, and sat about 3 people away
Taj Love!
from Deepak Chopra who gave a talk after Oprah did. Salman Rushdie was supposed to be there, but word on the street (or word on the rutted, potholed, red-dirt roads) is that some underworld Mumbai Muslim gangs were threatening to murder him if he came to India, so sadly he did not make it, but all the other authors were really angry about what had happened and many read passages out loud from The Satanic Verses, the book that caused him such grief and which is banned in India, in protest (these authors are now looking at trouble from the police because I guess when a book is banned in a country, it is illegal to read out loud from it as well).

Mom continued to be really, really sick – like the sickest I have seen her, ever, and so I was pretty much on my own in Jaipur which was fantastic, really, since I love that city so much (only kidding, hahaha!). I did, however, meet a really interesting woman named Kim out at dinner one night and we became friends for 3 days, and I brought her to the Lit Fest with me one day
Freaking Cold.
And see how happy I am about it?
and we just had those intimate, really great talks that people tend to have when they're travelling because you never know if you'll ever see the person again, and travelling creates this shared intimacy between people that I really love and thrive with. Kim lives in Jaipur with her boyfriend, who is a taxi driver here, and we were able to talk a lot about what it means to be a woman in India, and a Western woman in particular, and what it is like for her, dating an Indian guy and how his family deals with it and everything that goes along with that – I learned a lot, and I also got that it's really hard for her being here on her own, not having any girlfriends around, and that was when it hit me: maybe, this time, being in Jaipur and getting stuck there for an extra couple days because Mom was sick was not the end of the world for me – maybe, (gasp!), just maybe, this part of the trip was not about me at all – it was about meeting Kim and being able to be a girlfriend for her and sharing the time that we had together. It was really nice for me too, but I think it meant more to her to have someone there, finally, to talk to. So I was happy in the end that we wound up staying in Jaipur, although we did miss out on our camel safari in Jaisalmer that I was really looking forward to – maybe next time!

We came toAgra on the bus and it was a pretty decent ride, by Indian standards – the bus driver only stopped once, at a shop in the middle of an industrial wasteland, to buy himself two jars of mango pickles. I am not kidding, I can't make this stuff up. We had a good laugh about that before the bus carried on to Agra, and arrived without incident to a guesthouse where possibly the most lovely man on the planet is the proprietor, and thinks it is just FANTASTIC that I am here with Mom and keeps talking to us in French (he also thinks me speaking Hindi is just terrific too, and although I am absolutely awful at it, I don't stop trying!) because we're from Canada: “Comment ca va, Maman? Bonsoir, les filles!”. Pretty amazing.

We visited the Taj yesterday morning, and I was slightly worried that I would have a sense of “been there, done that” when we walked in, but nope! It was just as moving, just as breathtaking, just as spectacular as I remembered. My eyes filled up with tears, yet again, I was really emotional, yet again, and I was overwhelmed with the beauty and truly spectacular feeling that is the Taj Mahal, yet again. It felt weird, too, being with someone else there and sharing those feelings but it was really good! We got in again at sunrise, before too many people came, and I am again so happy that we did because it really lent an air of magic to it – at that hour, before the sun is entirely up, the Taj looks like an idea, like a dream, just painted or imagined in the distance. It really is a stunning piece of architecture, and the spirit in which it was built is amazing, like this man loved his wife THAT MUCH that he created this space for her (and to all those naysayers who insist that it wasn't built out of love or the cynics who point out that Shah Jahan had a ton of wives: shhhh! Just appreciate the beauty!) and I feel like I am getting very gushy about it, so I will stop now, I promise!

The rest of the day we just wandered around Agra, and I was reminded again of how much I love this city, for, again, no reason that I can pinpoint but it doesn't matter – what matters is that I find so much joy in being here and in sharing it with Mom. We went into a shop to buy a postcard from a 12 year-old boy and wound up walking out with two marble tea light holders (one of those incredibly smooth salespeople that I apparently cannot resist), and I visited the restaurant where three lovely little boys worked last time I was here that I ate at pretty much every meal of every day – two of them are still there, the littlest one having gone to Mumbai with his father. I've been thinking about them since I was here last time, worrying about them, and am glad to see that they seem to be well, but am still not super happy about the fact that instead of being in school they're working in a restaurant. I always find that a hard thing to see here, but I know that it is reality that some families need their children to work and that is going to be the case until the government really starts cracking down and makes school affordable for everyone (not to mention fixes all the other social problems) – who knows how long that will take or if it will every happen, but I always will keep hoping and praying that it does. In the meantime, at least these boys are well fed and seem happy and can speak excellent English and the oldest one remembered me from 2 years ago which I found really touching.

We're off now, onto the next destination, but are sending lots and lots of love home and to anyone else who is reading this 😊 I appreciate all the messages and positive words of encouragement about this blog, please know that it is because you are all reading it that I keep writing and it warms my heart to know that I can share little bits and pieces and small insights into this beautiful country, my adopted second home, with anyone who is reading these words! Really, it means so much.



XOXO

Rafiq - Driving Artiste
Well, just stopped off in Varanasi on our way from Bodh Gaya to Agra. Another 5 hour drive this morning and we're now waiting in the Hotel Radisson before we board the overnight sleeper to Agra at 17:45 which should be . . . . interesting. Also, the laptop is bust ( 14 day old HP Netbook ! ), so we will have to resort to hotel Internet and cyber-shacks for the time being. No piccies with this entry as the camera is in the car (and I'm not sure where the car is right now !).

Bodh Gaya was mind-blowing, for a number of reasons. But, before we get to that, I thought I should tell you a little about what we have learned about driving in India while it's still fresh in my mind.

Driving in India involves a different conciousnous altogether from driving in the UK. For example, I'm still not sure whether they drive on the left or the right, it seems to be up to you. In addition, the use of the horn is entirely different too. I reckon our driver must have blown his horn say once every 15 seconds for the whole journey, which makes a total of 1200 times for the whole journey.

The blowing of the horn has many different meanings in India. Here are just a few:

1. I'm behind you.

2. I'm in front of you.

3. I'm at the side of you.

4. Get out of my way (trad)

5. I'm getting out of your way.

6. I wonder what pressing this does.

7. Namaste.

8. My horn sounds like this.

9. Does your horn sound like this ?

10. It's quite sunny today.

11. Moo cows.

12. I haven't heard my horn for a few seconds, I wonder if it is still working.

They use it to tell the world where they are at regular intervals, I imagine rather similar to how dolphins communicate, when in a shoal of traffic.

With that in mind, here are a few questions that illustrate correct usage and behaviour for Indian road etiquette:

1. You are driving down a dual carriageway with a separate central reservation, when all of a sudden, you notice a large truck blaring its horn, on your side of the same dual carriageway travelling in the opposite direction in your lane. What do you do:

a) Accelerate, maintaining your course

b) Blare your horn

c) Swerve out of the way at the last minute only if it looks as though they're not going to chicken out first.

d) All of the above

e) None of the above

2. You are driving in a busy city when you come to a busy roundabout. You want to go right, what do you do:

a) Indicate right, wait for a gap in the traffic, then join the flow.

b) Blare horn to make a gap.

c) Dive straight into the traffic, not bothering to even go the right way round the roundabout, ploughing straight in the oncoming traffic, blaring hormn continously.

d) None of the above

3. You are driving down a busy street, when a pedestrian steps off into your path. Do you:

a) Blare your horn maintaining your current course of direction and speed.

b) Swerve to avoid the pedestrian.

c) Make an emergency stop.

d) None of the above.

Answers:

1. d) 2. c) 3. a)

How did you do ?

If you scored 0 or above, you are now eligible for a full Indian driving licence. This allows you to drive a car, motorbike, tuk-tuk, bus, HGV or elephant throughout India.

Don't get me wrong, our driver a was a good driver (the guide explained that driving in India is an art), we haven't hit anything at all, its just a differnet mind set.

Anyway, nearly time for the next bit of the adventure so better go. Will provide an update on Bodh Gaya when we get to Agra (Internet-access notwithstanding).

So colorful
Before ever deciding to go to India, our friend Kendra said this city, Varanasi, was life changing and a must do if we ever traveled to India. Once we decided to go to India we knew we had to see this city.

So what is it about this city that is so crazy? A few facts first: a holy city for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains (3 major religions in India), one of the oldest continously inhabited cities in the world and probably the oldest in India (per Wikipedia). The Hindus believe if they have their funeral here it is a direct road to Heaven and all followers must make a pilgrimage once in their life to dip in the Ganges River.

We witnessed multiple funerals while we stopped at 1 of the 2 burning ghats. What is a burning ghat? In the Hindu religion they cremate all of the dead and they do it on the river banks.

I told Pete if he didn't want to witness this life changing experience he could meet me later as this was something I really wanted to do. Pete joined me in my 30-45 minutes of watching the funeral process. We
Flower Ceremony
witnessed a woman carried down the stairs on a bamboo stretcher covered of course in beautiful fabrics, dipped in the holy river, then burned on a stack of wood. We saw many bodies burn over the 3 days we were in Varanassi but only watched the whole process of a few of those who had passed on. This is the only city in India that has funerals 24 hrs a day.

I noticed it was only men at the funerals and no woman, only the one's passing by along the ghat (river bank walkway). In the Hindu religion, men aren't allowed during the birth of their children and woman are not allowed at the funerals. Also funerals usually only happen between sunrise and sunset, where Hindu weddings only happen after sunset.

Many marriages are still arranged to this day and we got to hear 1st hand about it as our leader Danesh's marriage was arranged by his grandparents. Before he was born his grandparents made a promise to with another family that if they had a boy and the other family had a girl that they would marry one day and that is exactly what happened.

Some
flower ceremony/sunset cruise
other highlights in Varanasi: Open Hands, a coffee shop and bakery, that has crafts, silks and clothing which is must see if you visit; as their prices are amazing and the quality is the best we found in India. Too bad this was our 2nd too last city in India otherwise I would have purchased a lot more here (near Assi Ghat). Sunset boat cruise with the flower ceremony where you say a blessing or make a wish and then set the flower/candle into the river and all your wishes are too come true. Visiting where Buddha gave his 1st sermon after his enlightenment.

We stayed 2 nights at Hotel Divya which had a great location near Assi Ghat but only had hot water for a few hours a day. The food next door at Haifa Hotel was a great value and good.

Buddhist Temple at Sarnath
Today we visited Sarnath. This is a deer park just north of Varanasi and is where Lord Buddha gave his first sermon after receiving enlightenment. There's a beautiful Buddhist temple here, but the most dramatic sight here has to be Dharmakh stupa (a ""stupa"" is a mound-like structure containing Buddhist relics) which marks the very spot from where He gave the sermon. For Buddhists, this is one of the most important Buddhist sites and people come on pilgrimages from all over the world.

Practicing Buddhists will walk round the stupa clockwise 108 times (the number 108 comes up a few times in Buddhism, one of them being the number of defilements, or torments, Buddha had to overcome to attain enlightment). Not being fully fledged Buddhists, we only walked round 8 times, so we've still got another 100 to deal with !! Some of them were going round at a cracking pace (particularly Dave).

The site itself was very peaceful (despite the Buddhist tractor and the Buddhist naughty boys) and we took some time to reflect and watch the world go round (or rather, the Buddhists go round).

P.S. Forgot to mention, last night I had ""Battered Curliness in
Buddha Giving Sermon
Syrup"" for pudding. I was intrigued to find out exactly what it was. It looked like curly pieces of batter, but battered what ? Well, I can tell you, it was simply battered curliness. There was nothing inside, it was just curly batter. Still not plucked up enough courage to try the Steamed Idli for breakfast. Perhaps tomorrow.

On The Road To Agra
who's got the biggest headache....
Very early start and left Delhi at 07.30....streets very quiet so even more dangerous as vehicles shot across junctions in the mad belief they were alone on the road.

It was an interesting journey in our charabanc, lasting five and a half hours, avoiding various obstructions including wandering cows, buffalo, a political meeting (at least two thousand men across both carriageways), a crashed bus, and of course the usual maniac cyclists, pedestrians, tractors, et al.

Drove through NewAgra, ViaAgra, to OldAgra..

Checked into Tridant, shot straight out again to the Taj Mahal. Not much we can add to anything previously said about the Taj Mahal........ other than the length of the queues to get in.

Next Agra Red Fort. This is where Shah Jahan, the creator of the Jahan (Mosque in Delhi (see Day 2) and the Taj Mahal, was incarcerated (imprisoned) by his son for eight years until his death. His daughter decided to bury him in the Taj Mahal next to his second wife for whom he had built this wonderful memorial

.........

Don't forget we look forward to your comments!

C'était un intéressant voyage dans notre car, une durée de cinq heurs et demi, évitant les divers obstacles, y compris l'errance des vaches, buffalo, une réunion politique (au moins deux mille hommes à travers les deux chaussées), un autobus s'est écrasé et bien entendu les habituels maniac cyclistes, piétons, etc.

Après arrive à l'hotel Tridant, .. à nouveau pour le Taj Mahal. Nous ne pouvons pas rien à plus ajouter que était dire précédemment sur le Taj Mahal........ autres que la longueur des files d'attente pour l'entrer!

Prochaine arret Agra Fort rouge. C'est ou Shah Jahan, le créateur de la mosquée à Delhi (voir Day 2) et le Taj Mahal, a été incarcéré par son fils pendant huit ans jusqu'à sa mort. Sa fille a décidé de lui enterrer dans le Taj Mahal à côté de sa seconde épouse, pour qui il avait construit ce merveilleux monument

Taj Mahal
We were headed to Agra and our group leader, Danesh, had warned us that the accommodations in Agra were going to be very, very, very basic. We were all worried what this meant since we’ve stayed in some pretty bad places already. As we arrived at the bus station we saw the bus that we were supposed to take. There were three seats on one side and two on the other which is one more seat that normal. Waiting around we saw one man lean out the window and vomit out all over the side of the bus. Elyse likes to come up with catchy names for each mode of transportation and naturally this instantly became the vomit bus to Agra.



We all looked at the group leader and said you might as well just book us a private van now. It was getting late in our trip and we all wanted a little upgrade here and there. Yes, we were on the basic tour but it’s all a matter of interpretation of what basic is for each person. This was India basic which is well below our American and Australian basic. Leaving the station we decided to
Public bus to Agra
see how much the tour company was paying for these bus tickets; turns out the price was a whopping $1.00 for each ticket.



The van was comfortable and we were relieved not to have to ride the vomit bus. For the last ¼ mile or so we had to walk the rest of the way to our hostel because petroleum powered vehicles are banned near the Taj Mahal. There had been some discoloration of the Taj Mahal which was contributed to pollution. In the past 10 years over 72 factories have been shut down to due preserving the Taj Mahal and reducing the air pollution.



The streets were lined with the touristy shops and the common chaos you would normally find on the Indian streets, dogs, cows, garbage, etc. Our hostel was in a great location and had a really nice courtyard. It was setback from the street and had a very relaxing atmosphere. The rooms consisted of a bed and bathroom and that was it not even an outlet to charge our electronics.



The power was out for a lot of the day and hot water was only available for
or pay $10 each for a private van
four hours, two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. The rooms were indeed basic but not as bad as I had imagined. Later I would truly see how run down the place was when washing my hands the sink literally fell off the wall and water began gushing everywhere. Fortunately it was when we were checking out so it was going to be someone else’s problem.



While in Agra we spent the first day checking out a rug factory where Elyse and I were thinking of buying one as a nice memento. We selected two that we wanted to save so that we could take a day to consider the price. There were several indications that the place was only geared toward tourist, which means you are for sure going to get ripped off. Later, I would find on my trading website from other factories in the same city that these were overpriced by 30%. The following day we returned and I tried to negotiate and let the sales guy know that I wanted to buy one but at the going rate for the area. No deal was made so we walked away.
we decided on the van, we had enough




There are two main tourist attractions worth visiting in Agra, obviously the Taj Mahal and the other is the Red Fort. The Taj Mahal is a lot bigger than I imagined. It was a beautiful setting which is supposedly the most photographed building in the world. There were four entrances divided by gender and then again by Indian Nationals and Foreign Visitors. As a foreigner you pay 37.5 times more than the Indian counterparts. Entrance fee: 750 rupees = $15 for foreigners and 20 rupees= 0.40 cents for an Indian National seems fair right? This was standard all over India for any attraction fees as well as paying to use your camera.



Elyse cruised right in and waited for me for about 15 or 20 minutes while I stood in line.

There are a three main gates and several other buildings that make up the Taj Majal grounds. The building in the middle of the courtyard is the one most are familiar and is spectacular. I’ll let the photos do the talking. We arrived around three and stayed for sunset then headed back to our hostel. Along the way we bought our magnet
Handmade wool rugs
that we typically get in each country.



The Red Fort was a great attraction as well. We ended up getting a tour guide who walked us through the fort and explained to us the history and pointed out things we would have missed without him. It was well worth the money to pay for this service. We spent a few hours touring the grounds and taking photos.



Afterwards we headed back near our hostel and Elyse and I went and sat at an internet café. The owner lived in the US for about 15years and we had a nice conversation about India and listened to his opinions on the political and social topics as a native Indian. The ongoing theme from nearly all Indians who we spoke with was a genuine dissatisfaction with the government and overall corruption on nearly all levels. According to this man the power outages were simply a ploy by one party to undermine the other party and to ensure less power outages if the people were to elect that particular party in the upcoming elections.



Stayed 1 night at Hotel Sheela – great location near Taj
design
Mahal East Gate Entrance but rooms were not up to our standard.

1: Dawn on the Ganges 67 secs


Devotees On The Ganges
Well, considering that Varanasi is India's holiest city, there's an awful lot of guns here. A bit disconcerting last night with a couple of people wandering around the hotel lobby carrying machine guns. I dunno, perhaps they're holy machine guns ?! They are police (or army, or both), but sometimes they're dressed so casually it's hard to tell.

Also a bit wierd that to get into many of the temples you have to go through electronic security and be frisked. Maybe its holy electronic security ?!

Dawn on the Ganges was amazing. It's a different world here. I feel as though I'm walking around with my gob open, just gawping at everything all the time. The sites, the sounds, the smells. I was a bit spooked at first it was so different, but starting to get into the swing of things. It's so wierd, people lving in abject poverty side by side with designer and mobile phone shops. Driving along in our air-conditioned 4x4 while a guy outside carries dried cow pats on his head to sell as fuel at the market !!

After the Ganges, a walk through old Varanasi, tiny streets, bustling with people and the
A Varanasi Ghat
occasional cow (or is it bustling with cows and the occasional person?).

Then back for breakfast. I didn't fancy the Steamed Idli so I had a local dish known as ""Beens-om-Turst"". By 9:00am felt like we'd done a full day already.

Later more temples, specifically a Shiva temple and a Hanuman temple (which was overrun with monkeys, wasn't allowed to take any pictures though).

How to capture it all in words ? Perhaps some more poetry:

""Oh Varanasi, Holy City of Shiva,

On the banks of the Ganges Reever (sorry),

Incredible sllks and Indian cottons,

Essential oils and monkey's bottoms""

Day 8 13/01/12
We get the tuktuk to the bus station and jump straight on the bus to Fatephur Sikri. It costs just 27Rs. The bus has seen better days but its comfortable enough and it gets us there without breaking down. Neither of us has any idea where to get off but we figure we just get off when the rest of the non-Indians do. We pass through the Indian countryside but the waste and decay of the Indian cities follows us here. All along the road there are signs of Indian culture. Westernised advertising with charming spelling mistakes and misinterpretations. Rubbish strewn along the sides of the road. Decaying buildings serving as shelters for the homeless. We arrive at Fatepur Sikri via a huge red stone archway and enter into a crazy, bustling village. We are dropped at the far end of the market street so we walk a short way to the entrance of the mosque. Outside are numerous tourists and touts intermingled. We manage to deflect the attention of most but upon entering Ben is hooked. A man claiming not to be a tour guide but a member of staff says that he asks for no money. I try to politely get rid of him but Ben naively wanders after him. I walk around talking pictures and bump into Ben later having been sold a carved marble elephant that he never wanted and in the midst of being convinced to make further purchases from the man who says he worked here. After a struggle I manage to get away but he very nearly reeled me in too! Even as we walk away the man is following me with arms full of carved creations. He becomes more and more aggressive in his sales technique but we eventually lose him. However, by this point I have attracted the attentions of a young tour guide named Dannes who is just ten years old, has never been to school but speaks six different languages. He is polite and helpful and so I decide he can tag along and I will give him a little something for his time. He asks only for the ticket stub from my entry into the palace her and for Agra fort if I have it. He says he can sell them for around 50Rs but I tell him I don't want to part with them as I wish to create a book when I get back home. He seems to understand but still he asks if I can give him the ticket. After suffering fairly severe temple fatigue both Ben and I are ready to leave. Dannes waits patiently outside for our tickets but I reiterate my wish to keep it and give him 50Rs instead, with which he seems genuinely disappointed. I am so confused. He asks if i will swap my nice new, flat ticket for one that he has that is all bent up. I say no, I want to keep my ticket and he walks away dejected but 50Rs better off. Still, I feel terrible! I call him back and swap tickets, I figure it will be a more interesting memory this way. His face is illuminated!! We go our each separate ways, pleased with the encounter. I get back to the guesthouse with just enough time to work out where I am headed next. I finally decide that I am not prepared enough for the cold of Dharamsala and so I go on to Pushkar after Delhi. I have just enough time to book my next train to Ajmer which is the following morning at 4.30am. I get to Agra train station and find that it is the worst place so far for staring which I find so strange given that it is probably the biggest tourist destination in all of India. I hook up with an English couple sitting on the platform and chat with them whilst we wait for the train together. We are hounded by children asking for food and each feel terrible when we can give them nothing. We talk about how we deal with the poverty on India, especially when it comes to the children. I feel that I have grown a heart of stone in India as I put on the blinkers when I see them but I think and hope that this just a coping mechanism. If it got to you every time you would literally go through India in floods of tears as the are so many in need. I arrived into Nizamuddin and get a tuktuk to New Delhi where I have been recommended to stay in the Hotel Vivek. I book a night but stay for just a few hours. I watch TV and gain some peace from the hectic streets of Delhi. I dont bother to sleep as I will have to get up again at 2.30am to catch a taxi to Old Delhi train station. Day 9 14/01/12 There is a sweet man at the hotel who brings me a hot masala chai first thing and helps me to my taxi. It's icy cold this morning and the streets of Delhi have a thick freezing mist hanging over the ground. There are few people awake on the streets but so many sleeping, under thin blankets on the sides of the roads. It brings me to sadness. I arrive at the station I try to get a hot drink from a cafe called 'Continental' but the counter assistant won't serve me. He kept saying that the machine wasnt working. It was. I was so cold and really very tempted to use my recently acquired Hindi swear word but managed to refrain and instead went to the cafe outside who gladly gave my a hot chai. I proudly paraded passed the idiot at the Continental as I wandered over to my platform. I was travelling first class but there's not much difference between this and AC2, just a few more inches on the width of the bed. Arrived in Ajmer around 1pm and was instantly hounded outside the train station by rickshaw drivers shouting 'Pushkar bus stand, pushkar bus stand' at me. '3km, Pushkar bus stand'. The clerk at the enquiries office inside the train station had told me that I should just have to cross the road and catch the bus from beneath the clock tower so I assumed the rickshaw drivers were merely exaggerating the distance to gain some business. And so, in my best high and mighty, know it all strut I pass right by all the rickshaw drivers and wait on the other side of the road. I wait. And I wait. I ask a few bus drivers if they're going to Pushkar but each shakes his head and waves a hand vaguely in front of him. I wait a little time longer until a man approaches me to say that I am in the wrong place so I start walking in the direction of the numerous vague hand gestures. My bags grow heavier and heavier with every step and the straps started cutting into my shoulders. I look to jump into a rickshaw but find the street is one way, the wrong way so I continue to walk. I walked for about 3km in and finally arrived hot, sticky and in pain only to find that I could have hopped on the rickshaw from the train station for 5Rs (about 6p). Doh! I did meet a very nice street dentist along the way who sat up against a red brick wall on his three legged stool with his array of false teeth all dirty and coated in grime and laid out next to a variety of interesting looking creams, liquids and powders. I wandered up to the empty bus but was told that I could not board without a ticket. After waiting ages in the queue I had had enough of the locals pushing in ahead of me, my bags weighing me down and the man behind the counter who had seemingly gone to lunch. I just got on the bus which was now, of course, full. I was, however, welcomed to squeeze in with a large Indian family at the back who made some room for me to sit by juggling their children around. The girls chuckled as I struggled to get my bag off and almost took out one of them as it swung around. Got to Pushkar and to the Akash Hotel, loved it immediately. The staff are great, John doesn't say much but Deepak is very friendly. Met his fiancée Eva from Germany after assuming she was a tourist here. They were flying kites on the roof as today is the kite festival. I wandered through the market and bought a number of things. Could easily have bought so much more but could not fit it in my bags. This place reminds me so much of Gastonbury Festival, it feels so familiar. There is such an array of coloured clothes, bags, jewellery, ornaments etc that you could spend hours walking through the markets and could easily spend a lot of money. Maybe I will buy another bag. Watched the sun set over Pushkar lake at the sunset cafe. Ate well then headed back to get an early night. Slept well.

1: Drive from the airport . . 68 secs


Blimey - Varansi, holy city of Shiva, oldest city in India, banks of the Ganges, where all drivers have a death wish.

Starting to get a taste of the real India now - the journey from the airport was an experience in itself, you have to have the blessings of the Gods to arrive in one piece. Lots of poverty. Feel a bit wierd sitting in our Radisson suite somewhat insulated from it all. Big fat bloaty English blobs dripping in opulence. Shall we have the lard or the dripping for dinner dear ? ( Actually, we're disguised as vegetarians in India - but you take my point!)

Arrived mid-afternoon (flight delayed again, not due to screaming boys this time, but Air Force practicing for Republic celebrations on the 26th Jan) then spent the rest of the afternoon trying to get WiFi working. Bit flaky - IT support couldn't get it going and gave up. (I perservered but have had to cheat so don't know how long I've got before I get chucked off).

Anyway, tomorrow a dawn boat ride on the Ganges, and a tour of Varanasi.

First impressions ?

Moo cows.

Spotted Owl
Our day started at 6:45am when the alarm sounded in Jaipur as we met in the lobby at 7:20am. We ordered room service to be delieverd at 7am, which is when the restaurant opened. Pete and I both knew it probably was going to be an issue due to timing so I called room service at 6:55 to make sure our breakfast would be delivered so we had time to eat. We ordered cornflakes with bananas and toast so it wouldn’t be much prep time for the kitchen. Well at 7:10 our breakfast arrived with clumpy milk. We got our bags and headed to the restaurant and asked for different milk in order to eat our cereal. Needless to say we ate our food quickly and were in the lobby by 7:23am.




Our bus had more leg room than our last bus and was only about half full as this bus required everyone to have a seat. Other buses we have taken had the entire aisle filled with standing passengers. Our bus ride was supposed to be 6 hours but was a little over 4 hrs long, including a 15 minute rest stop for some snacks,
Kingfisher
chai and a bathroom break halfway.



Danesh advised us in Jaipur that there was nothing to do in our next town except go to the bird park. When we pulled into the bus stop I knew I would only be going from the hotel to the bird park and back. The poverty and trash here in Bharatpur was incredible and really wears on the soul. I am so thankful that Pete and I have traveled a lot before coming to India.



We ate some lunch and relaxed for an hour before heading to the Keoladeo National Park. This bird sanctuary was declared a National Park in 1981 and in 1985 declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We got to see many different types of birds while riding a cyclo rickshaw through the park. There are over 370 species of birds that have been recorded in the park including lots of migratory birds from all over Asia. The park does have the poisonous Indian Cobra and Viper but they hibernate during the winter so we didn’t witness them.



We spent 3 hours on our tour and we hope you enjoy
Picture 037
the photos. It was the most peaceful and natural place we have experienced in India (away from the hustle/bustle, poverty stricken streets) On our way out we saw a jackal but didn’t get a photo as it moved to quickly, everything else we got photos of.



Stayed 1 night:Birders Inn –considered “Most Posh Place we stayed” by our guide still no heat in all of India so far.

Pete's point of view-This happened to be our nicest hotel of the trip which has a very nice garden courtyard. At night we light a fire in the pit in the middle of the courtyard and sat around eating our dinner and talking with owner of the hotel. It was a pretty good experience as well. Later he sent one of his employees out to buy us Kit Kats. I think it was more of a display for the owner to show that he could order people around more so than the simple act of getting us candy, either way we were happy.

New observations:
- people like to spit
- it sounds like most of the locals have smoked 5 packs of cigarettes for 80 years (or lived in front of an open fire all their life - there is a lot of coughing going on)

- pollution is all around

- there are no garbage bins to be found

- dying in Varanasi is good because you can reach moksha (= the liberation from being a subject of the cycle of death, reincarnation and rebirth)

- foreigners are subjects of some serious price discrimination



Dear greetings from the spiritual and dusty Varanasi (or Benares as our parents like to call it and/or Kashi as the locals call it). After a 30h train ride through India (which was comfortable and relaxing for the first 25 hours and just plain boring for the remaining 5h) - but overall, very undramatic) we arrived in Varanasi, the most religious city of India. We went by Rickshaw which stopped close to the Uma Guesthouse (which turned out to be Rudra Guesthouse) where we got picked up by the owner of our guesthouse, Lalu. He then brough us to the right place which is located in the old part of Varanasi, closed to the Ganga River (Ganges) and the Prayag Ghat. The climate is colder here than in Mumbai, we've sort of realized that we did NOT really pack for this kind of temperature. But oh well, we will survive.

Varanasi is a city which is more than 10,000 years old. Along the Ganges there are several amazing buildings and ghats (=which are generally used as a bathing spot but also for cremation of the bodies which are later burned), built by great Maharaja's (= kings) from different cities in the past. We have been staying in the Old Part of Varanasi which is basically a mixture of old alleys (in which you can easily get lost!), cow/dog/monkey/etc.etc. poop, guys on mopeds honking their brains out, sleeping dogs, corps (true story!), salesmen, garbage and red paan (people chewing betel leaf with areca nut and lime paste, and katha brown powder paste) spit. Now this might make you think that we're not reeeeally enjoying our stay here - but here's the thing - Varanasi is truely beautiful. When taking the previously mentioned remarks into consideration - add a pinch of humor on top - and you'll be fine.

The guesthouse where we are staying is giving 20%!o(MISSING)f their revenue to their school Learn for Life Society. This is a project which helps children from poor families to get an education, all pro bono. As a traveller you are always welcome to help out - so we are. On our first day in Varanasi we visited the school and met Lalu's wife Arti, which is basically our idea of the ultimate power woman. She made us the best Chai tea we've ever tasted (and we have the recipe!) and told us all about their project. They also have a bakery close by which is called the Brown Bread Bakery where some of the revenue also goes to the school project.

Unfortunately there are some clouds on this Indian sky. This project started out as a collaboration with a German guy called Michael. According to the story which Arti and Lalu shared with us, Michael came to India at the age of 18, leaving a dark past behind after being convicted for possession of narcotics. He came to India to do some social work and was taken in by Arti and her family since he basically came here with nothing, knowing no one. Together they founded Learn for Life Society, being able to use their different advantages to create a well-functioning and sustainable project. Unfortunately, the collaboration did not work out, and now Michael opened a new Brown Bread Bakery on the other side of the street using the same sign, same name (Learn for Life) and the same logo. The reason for this break-up was because Michael embezzled money. He's obviously arguing the same thing.

To make a long story short, Arti and Lalu put great effort in trying to make us take action because we're from Germany. We would really like to help them, at least make sure that the money which is meant to go to their projecis placed here.

So - if you want to know more about the project that we are talking about - please check out the folllowing homepage: www.rudraguesthouse.com There Arti and Lalu will tell you more about their amazing project.

We actually wanted to contribute a bit more, so we held an English class at the Learn for Life school last Thursday. The kids are so amazing and it's so nice to see how eager they are when it comes to learning and how happy and energetic they are - just like kids are supposed to be. It was a great pleasure being there and spending time with the kids and their teachers, an experience which we will never forget.

Then the first stomach flu made its apperance. Not too bad luckily, only one of us got sick (poor Anna) - and she was fine the day after, after sleeping for 16 hours. Yes - travelling can be exhausting and sometimes you (obviously) need a break.

So, this being our final day in Varanasi, we're going to go and see the Benares-Hindu University which is located not too far from the Old Town. Then we'll start to head to Varanasi Junction to get our train to Agra - which is our next stop, famous for 'the Taj'.

Uh, and by the way, we actually made a little video from our tour on the Ganga River. Enjoy (and sorry about the abrupt end - Anna's phone ran out of battery).

(Psst - fun facts about the Ganga River: Samples from the river show the water has 1.5 million faecal coliform bacteria per 100mL of water - sometimes there isn't even any Oxygen left. Additionally, it is filled with chemical wastes, sewage and even human and animal remains which carry major health risks by either direct bathing in the dirty water. Around 2,000,000 people bath in Ganges every day.)



Again - enjoy.

Love love - A & C

January 19th 2012
Published: January 19th 2012


A long while since my last blog. Alot and a little has happened since then!!

First off we left the chilly heights of the mountains and made our way back to Delhi. We made a visit to the 'Zoo' to pass the time. Now being in India the 'Zoo' is not much more than a park with cages, these cages more often than not being empty, full of rats or unlabelled so that no-one has the foggiest what the animal inside is. We did get to see some Tigers and Lions and other awe-inspiring animals (even if their habitat had a lot to be desired for).

Onwards from here to Khajuraho. This quaint little town is home to some rather erotic sculptures, namely the 'Karma Sutra' temples. Very imaginative I give them that!! We spent a few days here visited a few times by a mouse, who probably lived in our room loooong before we did. After seeing the main temples there is not a great deal to do except see more (less splendid) temples. So we hired bikes and went to see the 'less good' ones.

Our next plan was to visit a National Park, see some tigers, ride and elephant, spy on rare wildlife. Great! So we prebook our accommodation with the tourist trust and made our route to get there. A highly stupid route. Instead of getting the train for one hour we decided to get the bus for five and waste time like this rather than waiting at the train station. The bus we were meant to get didn't show. After another hour the next came. And it was relatively empty. Result! That was untill we got to the next town when about 100 people crammed on making the bus about 4 times over capacity. Ciaran was used as a table for people's fruit and veg (as he couldn't fit his knees into the actual seat). We finally got to the train station (nearing 11pm) to find our train delayed for 4 hours. And it was cold, there were cows all over the gaff and morale was low!! Finally our train pulled into the station. Or so we thought. Several people assured us this was our train!!

Finally we get some sleep, only to be awoken 3 hours later in Allahabad. Not a national park. So some 6 hours to wait for a 8 hour train or something of the like we jacked in the idea of the National Park and made for Varanasi. And it turned out to be a bloody good thing to!

Varanasi. Not much more than a dirty river we found out on our first day. I say this but I am sure that in better circumstances I would have felt different. We spent the day walking up the ghats and seeing the different sights to behold. Including the very interesting/disturbing/amazing cremations. The auspicious ceremonies take place continuously throughout the day. We paused to watch a complete one. Turns out that there can be an element of humor as the son (possibly) of the deceased lit one final cigarette and placed it in the mouth and then dowsed him with whiskey. Nice.

Our second day in Varanasi took a turn for the worse. As some of you are aware my stomach did not take well to India. Not at all. No other way to put it really but I had the shits. Again. After 6 weeks of my stomach doing on/off gymnastics a trip to the hospital was needed.

To the horror of the consulting doctor I should never had let it persist for so long and was admitted for tests and such straight away. I was given the 'VIP' bed in A&E (which was a curtain to hide me from the other patients who no matter how ill they were loved a good stare!) The nursed tried to get an drip in me however my veins had other ideas. Mum you'll be glad to know that I could never be an intravenous drug user it would just be too much effort! After one of my quick toilet dashes I cam back to find that the VIP area had been taken over by a billion nurses trying to revive the woman (who I am sure was dead, bless her) on the bed next to me. Great start!!

I was then transferred to the ward, accompanied by my new husband according to the hospital records ?!?! Poor Ciaran. The delightful room I stayed in was complete with window, flat screen tv and numerous blood stains on the wall. The best part about it was that it hadn't been cleaned from the previous occupant, blood in the bin, piss in the pan and sick in the sink. However the toilet was unscathed. Joy!

And so began my week long stay in hospital. I was originally supposed to be in for two but that was soon prolonged. Ciaran moved in, made friends with the troop of monkeys that lived out side the window of my room, he even went out to feed them pizza that I couldn't eat.

The nurses were very nice and helpful, the doctor was hard track down to find out what was going on. I was being given about ten different medicines and not a clue why. Luckily when my mum rang I asked her to google what they were for so we had some kind of idea it was more than a dicky tummy. The nurses were extremely noisy. At any given time of the night or early morning two could walk in and start a conversation, share a joke and once launch into a full blown argument. And they couldn't understand why I slept until 10 (fuckers kept me (and Ciaran) up most of the night)

The thing that got me through the ordeal was BBC entertainment (Rick Steins Mediterranean Odyssey) and AXN (Total Wipeout and Minute to Win it). But the thing that nearly finished me off was the food. The plain, cold rice that I had to eat and the soggy toast. On that alone I could have flown back for my Christmas dinner! Thanks to everyone who called and texted to keep me sane. And to Ciaran for putting up with me/the food/the bad tv.

After a zillion antibiotics I was released (with a billion more). 22nd of December, just in time for Christmas! For those of you who want to google it I had amoebic dysentery caused by E Coli and Entamoeba Histolytica. Niiice!

But I am all good now. Morale of the story, go the doctors earlier! And stop moaning about the NHS. Seriously we take that shit for granted!

After about 16 days of living in a tent and hours of taxi rides, we were very happy to have arrived in Agra and found that the 'cheap' hotel we booked online ended up being a 5 star hotel. It was very nice to be able to get some R&R in our room and actually have a nice WARM shower! While in Agra, we visited the Taj Mahal. Enjoy the pictures!

I boarded the train in Varanasi Junction station at 5.20pm, where I had arrived early so I dumped my backpack on the floor trying hard not to think about what I was putting it in. They spit a lot in India and it's common to see red splatters of paan (chewing tobacco) all over the streets. I sat next to a little boy selling guava. I smiled at him and he looked back at me with confusion all over his face. The children in the orphanage had taught me the Hindi word for smile which is 'hashna'. I said this to him and he looked so concerned at my knowing some Hindi. So much so that he then ran away to some older men and jabbered something in Hindi. The men laughed at him and it seemed he was asking them to help him move his stand but they found it amusing that he was scared of a little westerner. He found another boy to help him move the stand, literally, about two feet further away from me and he seemed somewhat more comfortable with this but still looked at me as if I would leap up and murder him at a moments notice. I found it all very funny but I wondered why he was so afraid of me.



Soon after, my train arrived. I, along with every other white person on the platform, wandered up towards the AC2 carriage. I find that, unlike the last when all my roomies were Indian, I am this time surrounded by westerners. A couple from America and a lady from Australia. We all get off at Agra Fort which is due in at 5.55am the following morning. We chat for a while but then I resolve to catch up on my blog and listen to Bon Iver on my iPod. I get an early night but sleep very little. On the top bunk in the AC carriage it is freezing so I wake several times. People chat quietly in various languages throughout the carriage, men wander up and own and I think at one point I kicked someone in the head mid stretch.



I arrived in Agra Fort almost on time. It is still dark but the whole train station is alive with activity. Indian women carrying their modern luggage perched upon their heads, taxi touts outside the doors, people commuting and grabbing a chai en route. India is bustling even at the time of the morning.


I called the hostel who sent a tuktuk straight away to pick me up. As soon as I get to the guesthouse I experience my first Indian sleazebag. The manager of the guesthouse, Yusuf, who is the owners son at just 21 wraps his arm around me and strokes my sleeve until I tell him that this is not ok. But even then he continues to make comments like 'I give you double room madam, you want to share? You want to share with me?'. I make a point of mentioning immediately that I have a husband in the UK but this doesn't seem to deter him in the least. In fact, he seems even more persistent. I suspect he is this way with all his female guests and I ignore it as best I can. It's almost 7am by the time Yusuf has stopped pouring over me and showed me to my room. I close the door and relax for a while but cant sleep as the rest of India is awake and noisy. It's noisy out on the streets, it's noisy upstairs where they are doing building work on the roof and it's noisy out in the corridor where other guests have stirred and ventured out in search of breakfast. By 9am I'm bored so I ask Yusuf if he can arrange a tuktuk just to Agra Fort. Haseen arrives outside just a few minutes later. He shows me a book full of comments from previous guests. All seem very positive and so I agree to let him drive me around for the day. We agree a price of 600Rs (about £7) and we set off to see the baby taj. The tuktuk ride is freezing cold as the mornings are bitter in India at this time of year. On arrival I get a stern talking to from Haseen and am told that I should not accept any food or drink from strangers, I should not allow men to show me around as unofficial tour guides will often pose as staff but will then try to extort money from you afterwards. I enter the grounds a little on edge after the plethora of warnings, expecting to be grabbed and harassed at every turn but I find the place to be very peaceful with few people at all. I enter through the main archway and am confronted by an imposing building. At this moment I am grateful that Haseen has brought me here first as I think it would be disappointing to have seen this after the Taj Mahal which, let's face it, most if not all architecture pales into insignificance next to. From here you can see across the river to the hustle and bustle of the rest of Agra but here I am able to grab a few moments peace. I walk alongside the wall that separates the structure and grounds from the river and look down. A small boy is walking along the waters edge. He glances up and his face illuminates to see a big sack of western money staring back down at him (that's me, and that's how I feel, not all but some, Indian people see me sometimes). He sees my camera and shouts up to me 'picture, picture?' I take a shot of him smiling and waving frantically. He asks then for chocolate, I don't have any. He then asks for a pen which I throw down to him. Then he asks for money so I say no as I had already given him my last working pen...which in hindsight was stupid. I should have just given him the 2Rs he was asking for (about 3p). I finish up and head back to Haseen, where he waits just outside the gates. Next he wants to take me to the back of the Taj Mahal. We chat about his family and he asks me that old indian favourite, am I married. I explain that I have been with my fiancée for 7years and we hope to marry soon. I expect judgement but what I get is mild envy. Haseen explains that he thinks it is a wonderful thing to be able to know your partner before marrying them. He is Muslim and his parents chose his wife for him. He says with a big round smile 'but I am lucky, I have a beautiful wife, a good wife'. They have three children, two daughters and one son and he is very happy. We pass a 'laundry' on the way to our destination. It's a feast for the eyes. Hundreds of beautifully vibrant, coloured saris laid out on the dusty road to dry in the sunshine. I wonder if it ever occurred to them that laying freshly cleaned clothes out on a dusty road is counterproductive, as we pass by. We arrive and Haseen directs me down an old track. I walk for a few minutes, passing some children and a man with a camel on the side of the road. The area is wooded but the track is open to the increasing warmth of the sun. I reach the end of the path where there are a few men sat to my right, here in what feels like the middle of nowhere, still there are men just sitting around, seemingly doing nothing. I reach a barbed wire fence and a tired, old metal gate. The fence stretches out as far as he eye can see in both directions and beyond is the Taj Mahal. It is magnificent. In the haze of the morning it looks almost like an apparition. I take a bunch of pictures and head back to the tuktuk. On the way I am accosted by two boys selling postcards. One clings to the others arm, who guides him along the road. The boy is blind, his eyes milky white. I speak to them in my basic Hindi and as soon as I do, the charade of selling is dropped and they now speak to me more like a human being and less like a walking dollar bill. We chat about where they come from and they ask me about my life. In hindsight I wish I had bought a few postcards from them and as I write about the experience, I find that I am upset that I didn't. You get so constantly harassed in parts of India, always there is someone wanting something from you and so you become blinkered and shut off to people in many ways. These boys weren't begging, they didn't ask for anything but for me to buy a postcard and in fact as soon as we started chatting even that stopped (unlike many others who will hound you until you give in or run away). I wish I had bought a postcard or two. Have I become so thick skinned that cannot even see when the time is right to give? The cause is most often worthy but it is impossible to give to everyone. They waved goodbye to me as we drove away, with wide smiles. Haseen next dropped me off at Agra Fort and then headed home for lunch. I had an hour and a half in the fort which was a fascinating place with wonderful views over to the Taj Mahal. I felt that all my sightseeing so far was all building up to the Taj. I sat in the courtyard of the fort to eat lunch when I spotted a large red monkey over the other side with a fairly severe limp. He had spotted me too. He started moving towards me slowly and almost as if to pretend that he had no intention of robbing me of my lunch. I put the food away pretty quickly and moved to the other side of the courtyard. He nonchalantly wandered over to where I had been sat, as if he hadn't even seen me or my food. He wandered off and out of sight but it turned out I had no idea who I was dealing with. This monkey, despite his physical ailment turned out to be like ninja cat of the monkey world!! Every time I glanced up from my food he was completely still but each time, a few steps closer to me. I was being stalked. I decided to abandon lunch and instead photographed some Muslim men in brilliant white full length tunics who stood out beautifully against the red brick of the fort. Soon after they decided to come sit with me. My basic Hindi didn't get me very far with them and they did not speak English at all so we sat in silence until I went to leave. All of a sudden a camera appeared and they asked to have a photo taken with me. I could hardly say no after snapping away at them paparazzi style with my zoom lens!! Finally, about two hours before sunset, I arrived at the Taj Mahal. After another safety talk from Haseen I started on my way towards the Western entrance gate. It was buzzing with people. Many, many Indian tourists and a few westerners where queuing to get in. I bought my ticket at the horrendous price of 750Rs for foreign visitors. NB. Indians pay about 20Rs to gain entry. When I came to join the queue for security I was horrified to find four separate queues. Foreign females, foreign males, Indian men and Indian women. Now at this moment I was both glad to have paid the extra as the queue for me was almost non existent but at the same times ashamed to see that the queue for Indian women was about 150 deep. There is no preferential treatment for these ladies as foreigners and Indian men are invited in before them. It was shameful. That night I met a few of the visitors at the guesthouse; a group of brash Australians who talk loudly and smoke whilst everyone else is eating, a Dutch girl who seems incredibly highly strung and speaks about a hundred miles an hour and a slow speaking American named Ben. I order my dinner twenty minutes after him so he is a little perturbed when my food turns up first but we chat about the places we've been. He's heading to Fatephur Sikri in the morning and asks if I want to tag along. My train isn't until 4pm so we agree to meet at breakfast and leave for about 9am.

Day Five 10/01/12



I woke early as is usual when the rest of the world wakes around you, banging and clattering, shouting and singing, ringing and chiming. There has been chanting and bells every morning I have been here. I assumed it was a group of people getting together for a morning singsong but this morning I ventured out early to get some snaps before Mayur arrived and found that it is in fact many people separately worshipping their chosen gods in their miniature shrines on the street. When I arrive back at the hostel I meet Mehdi and Sahi, a brother and sister from Iran. I mention that I plan to go to Sarnath today and they ask to tag along. I'm glad of the company and it turns out they are both into photography so I get to nerd out all day on cameras, lighting and composition etc. Sahi actually teaches photography and so I get a few handy tips along the way.



We head first for the massive Buddhist stupa of red brick. Immediately we all notice how much cleaner it is within the gated grounds. There are very few people within the gardens, which are well kept and we find that it is very refreshing to see some nature again. Next we head to the new 'giant' Buddha statue that has been completed just this year.



This is a Buddha of biblical proportions, I mean Godzilla like and no photo could do justice to the size of it. Once again the grounds are clean and well kept. I approach the statue to take pictures of the shrine at its base only to see a small Indian man running towards me flailing and shouting. I see then that there are many signs around about requesting that shoes be removed before stepping up to the shrine as is the custom in all temples here, so I should have known better. I apologize profusely and Mehdi thinks its hilarious.



The next stop is the one I am most interested in. The stupa that has been built over the space where Buddha gave his first sermon. At the gates where we pay for entry there are beggars, children asking for food, mothers with babies and small boys selling statues of Buddha. I thicken my skin and attempt to walk through but a little girl comes up to me with the biggest eyes I've ever seen stretching her pinched fingers to her lips. I crumble immediately and give her a nutbar from New Zealand that I have in my rucksack and she seems very happy with her purchase. I motion to her to share with the little boy stood next to her and bobbles her head but who knows. I wish I had enough food to give to them all but India is starving at ground level so I could never give enough. I find myself not left with a positive feeling from my small act of altruism but with a sensation of guilt that nothing I could do would ever be enough.



Mehdi gets the tickets and as they are Iranian, they are often mistaken for Indians by Indians so he tries his luck and says to the man in the ticket office ""one westerner and two Indians"" and he gets two tickets half price!!



The excavated structure is fascinating and the monument build over the place where the sermon was delivered is mammoth. It is fully enclosed as the space was seen as so sacred that no person should ever tread upon it. We spend an hour or so here whilst our rickshaw driver (Mayurs cousin, supposedly) waits outside. I say supposedly because Mayur claims to be related to so many people that he is either embellishing the truth or he is actually related to all of India.



There are Hindi couples who sit on benches very close together and holding hands within the Buddhist grounds. This is not allowed outside in the Indian world so they must relish coming here where public displays of affection are not frowned upon. I am asked by several groups of Indian men if they may take a photo with me. At first I say no and they are always very respectful but seem genuinely disappointed so I agree later on and find that they are very happy to have their photo taken with a 'scruffily dressed, unwashed for two days, hairs a complete mess' western girl. Take that one home to show the folks, I don't think?



We make a quick stop at the Japanese temple before stopping in at a restaurant that serves me a can of pineapple juice that is well passed its sell by date and Meti a glass for lemon soda water with some 'free stuff' in it. We each get a bad feeling about the place and decide not to eat here. And so we head to the orphanage via a kite shop where I buy fifty kites for the children including the best type of string for about £12. In india the children (and often the grown ups) play with kites and the idea is to battle the other kites in the sky. You must wrestle your kite against the others by intertwining the strings and eventually the strongest string will cut that of the opposing kite. There are two main types of string, plastic and glass based. The glass based is the strongest and cannot be cut. I bought a whole reel of the glass based string.



While we waited for them to place it on to 25 separate reels, we wandered up the market street even though we were advised not to by our driver as this is not a tourist area. However, we had no problems whatsoever. I find Indian people do not hassle you half as much as the books suggest, not in Varanasi at least. But then I haven't yet been to Agra so I may be speaking too soon? But the people in Varanasi have been kind and helpful and often are just that. Many are just curious and do literally just want to tell you about their lives, their cities and their country. It is the minority who are seeking to scam you out of your money.



At Kutumb Orphanage, the concert was wonderful. The children put on a great show of dancing and singing and here was tabla playing and a traditional hindi devotional song. However, we could not stay long as we had not eaten all day and so we went in search of food. Mehdi and Sahi took me to a place they had discovered the previous night. Just off one of the busiest main market streets in Varanasi was a mini oasis of calm. We walked through a darkened arched alleyway into what felt like another world leaving the carnage of the high street far behind us. They served traditional Indian food as well as stonebaked pizzas and pasta. I opted for Indian and chose the palak paneer, saag zeera and some garlic naan. It was gooooooood! The backdrop of the restaurant was a beautiful Nepalese style temple complete with a dozen or so cows and bulls plus monkeys clambering above.



We rushed back to the hostel to charge Sahi's camera battery before heading to the Puja ceremony. This time I caught the end and so with the two nights viewing I manage to see the whole thing. I stood right in front of the pedestals where the Brahmins stand and was showered with orange carnation petals. We then jumped in a boat and took a short ride to the burning ghats to see the cremation fires from the water. We managed to find our way back to the hostel where there was a traditional concert of music and dance going on in the small reception area. I listened from my room next door. It was beautiful.



Day Six 11/01/12



This morning I woke early to get a morning boat ride with Meti and Sahi at 8am. Having had a pretty poor nights sleep for the past three nights I was somewhat zoned out. We hop aboard our boat with our little skipper called Deepak. He is probably around 15 and small framed yet he is able to row this huge 20ft boat unaided. Unsure of how his English is I mutter ""a little man for such a big boat"" to which he replies ""yes madam but full power, full power, 24hour, no toilet, no shower"". We all fall about laughing. He takes us to the burning ghats nearby. No photos are allowed here but we steal one or two of the architecture as it is so beautiful and so very ancient looking. The thick layer of black soot probably adds to this.



The Ganges is beautiful at this time of the morning. It's eerie but incredibly peaceful and calm. Don't get me wrong, it's still as septic and disgusting as any other time but it's incredibly still. There is a heavy mist that has been sitting over Varanasi for as long as I've been here. This is common in winter and is creates a real sense of atmosphere. It's barely possible to see to the other side of the river and row boats appear out of the fog, quietly pass us by and are gone again. I enjoy the moment though seeing people bathe in it, ritually dipping in it, brushing their teeth in it, washing clothes in it, going to the toilet in it all niggles at me in the back of my mind but in this moment I just appreciate that this is every day life for many of these people. We are taking many, many photos between us as this is so far removed from anything we do or see in our neat and tidy, sterile little lives but to these people, this is all normal.



I take a moment to grab a photo of a man washing his laundry in the river and wonder what he is thinking as he looks up at me. At the end of the day, my capturing this scene is akin to someone photographing me putting my dirty clothes into the washing machine at home, which is as uninteresting as life gets.



We are taken to the second burning ghat where they run the cremations using a machine. Deepak enlists Mehdi to help him with the rowing which is fairly disastrous as they are completely out of time but is much to the amusement of Sahi and I. We jump off here and choose to walk back along the ghats. I start speaking to a Swedish guy called Gustav who has been traveling since 2010! He joins us for breakfast and then he is gone. I love this about traveling; the random acquaintances made along the way. No email addresses were exchanged and we didn't get to surnames. We just had breakfast together and then said goodbye.



At breakfast, incidentally, a very large monkey came and sat next to our table, perched upon the railing next to us overlooking the ghats. But the cheeky creature was more interested in peoples breakfast than any views. He quickly realized that we had no food left but soon spotted another poor victim who had two very tasty looking pieces of toast sat at the edge of his table and before he had time to respond or even know what was happening the toast was gone and the monkey was perched high above enjoying someone else's breakfast. It was hilarious. The restaurant owner said that the monkey was the god hanuman who does not steal from women and so this is why he did not take from our table. He failed to notice that we had finished our breakfasts already, which may also have had something to do with it?



After breakfast we headed back to the hostel to get packed up and ready to leave. Along the way we took many pictures of morning life on the ghats. Men being shaven with cut throat razors whilst sat on the floor, three generations of women washing each other in the river, sadhus sitting completely zoned out in tune only with god, a man who is said to be the human form of Ganesh (the elephant god), children selling postcards, men repairing boats with a heavy smell of bitumen hanging in the air. We stopped and chatted to a few people about what they were doing and many were more than happy to speak with us. One man wrapped in rags was perched atop a set of steps, I photographed him which he seemed to enjoy, so much so that he followed us along the banks for a while, not asking for anything, just interested in what we were doing. As we watch life happening in front of us a man approaches carrying a quiver of woodwind instruments. Mehdi stopped him to chat and tried a few out, the seller played and it sounded beautiful, Mehdi played and it sounded like heavy tar. But it gave us a good opportunity to take some great photos.



Back at the hostel I tried to figure out what to do after Agra as Dharamsala is under three feet of snow with no power at the moment. I'm hoping things improve so I can continue on there but need to work on a backup plan. I'm thinking I could head to Rishikesh at the foot of the Himalayas but could also stick with my original plan and go on the Pushkar but getting a train now at such short notice is proving difficult. Let's see what happens...

Street Food
Leaving Nepal we cross the border into India. We stop at the side of the road for lunch and after a short walk down a muddy street I opt for a samosa and some dhal from a little man making them on his stall...After past ""Delhi Belly"" experiences I am a bit reluctant but too hungry to care right now!...They are actually delicious and cost just 5 rupees (about 6 pence!) and no bouts of illness (yet!)



After a 2 hour hold up at customs and a very long bumpy truck drive we arrive in the holy city of Varanasi. Myself & Cassie decide to break away from the group for dinner and go to a restaurant down the road - there's a few westerners in there so we figure it must be ok. We get chatting to a group of Ozzies who then take us to a lovely little outdoor cafe with fairylights and the most amazing apple pie & icecream! A little gem in this otherwise dirty, poor, squalor of a city. Of course many parts of India are poor and dirty but Varanasi seems to be to an extreme...



If they say
Street Food
the streets of London are paved with gold, the streets of Varanasi are paved with shit...quite literally, of all kinds...Dog shit, goat shit, cow shit, human shit...It's not pretty but I try to see (& smell!) past this initial assault on the senses.



We randomly meet another Ozzie guy in the street named Michael who seranades us with his Guitar - I natuarally request the Home & Away theme tune and we all have a bit of a sing song; there's a lot of westerners here and they all seem to be into Ashram Yoga...all dressed in the typical Indian Traveller attire including baggy harem pants with the crotch down to their ankles and the signature bindis or orange Sanskrit graffitied across their foreheads. I wonder how long it will take until I'm cloned into this ""traveller"" style!...Though I am tempted to take the piss and scrawl the word ""Twat"" across my forehead in swirly writing...



We get up early for a sunrise boat ride on the River Ganges to see the burning of the dead - The Ganges is considered to be holy and it's a Hindu ritual to both bathe in the
Varanasi
river to rid your sins and also to cleanse the dead before they are cremated on the burning fires. There is no real sunrise as the fog is too thick which makes the whole thing quite eerie. An old man climbs aboard our boat and hands out candles in mini flower baskets which we lay on the surface of the water to sail down the river - I'm not sure of the significance of this but it earns him 10 rupees a go. It's hard to see what is going on at the Ghats where they burn the dead but I'm not sure that's a bad thing...

Later Cassie, Becky, Phil & I take a walk down the river - I say walk but's it's more like a hop, skip & jump to dodge the piles of poo on the pavement...Also avoiding the hawkers trying to sell us a boat ride, head massage, necklaces, postcards and loads of other shit we don't want!...Not to mention dodging the dozens of street dogs and street cows that are all hanging out on the Varanasi version of the Thames South Bank. The sun is shining now and there's a breeze in the
Basket of Candles
air so there's an abundance of children flying their kites over the river - I am also dodging kite strings!...The children oblivious to the chaos around them...

We pass more people bathing or meditating and I see a man meditating with two others. He has a face like the elephant man...it stretches right down to his waist! It's the oddest thing I've ever seen and I try not to stare. I feel awful for him but thankfully for him Hindu religion means people see deformities like this as a sign of a God so therefore he is celebrated and worshipped instead of ostracised.

We reach the last Ghat on the river which is by far the busiest. Hundereds of people are crowded round to see the bodies, wrapped in orange cloth & marigold flowers, being carried down to the river, cleansed in the holy water and put down on hot coals to burn. It is actually quite tasteful if a little eerie, but not as bad as what I'd expected. The stench however is terrible but then the whole of Varanasi smells so bad it is hard to determine one vile pong from the next. As Cassie did
Candles
point out ""The only good thing about Varanasi is that you can fart and nobody notices cos the whole place smells anyway!""



Mid morning we visit some temples but our guide fails to turn up so we have no idea what we're looking at. However, to be honest I'm too concerned about my Converse trainers being pinched from outisde! Thankfully overly-enthusiastic-Phil is guarding our shoes for us so they are safe.

A short visit to a silk factory (bit of a busman's holiday for me) ends in a hard sales pitch from the owner who shows us some beautiful wall hangings...But no I'm not going to pay $250 for one when I can get the same thing in the market for a tenner. Luckily for him there are plenty that are gullible and willing in my group and we leave him with a smile on his face and a wedge in his pocket. We take a tuk tuk back, weaving in and out of the street cows & dogs, children, goats, beggars, bikes, cars, shit and more shit to arrive back at the hotel - step out and slip...Yep my precious Converse right in a pile
Old man handing out candles
of poo!



Varanasi very nasty but an experience I'll never forget!

Day Four - Varanasi



09/01/12



I was woken throughout the night by monkeys jumping on the roof, crying puppies and people vomiting violently somewhere in the hostel.



Had a very hot shower and tried really hard to convince myself that the water came from somewhere other than the septic Ganges. Mayur confirmed that the local water does come from the septic Ganges but reassured me that it goes through a purification plant first. Not much reassurance at all really when you see what they put in the Ganges and knowing how famous the Indians aren't for having clean water??



So Mayur was on time at 9am and we set out for the brown bread bakery to get a take away breakfast of banana and honey cake which was pretty good. We jumped in the auto rickshaw and headed to the Dhurga Temple. A female goddess that rides on the back of a lion and who's temple is painted blood red all over.



Next stop was one of the oldest temples, the Manas Temple. And finally to the newest temple. I can't actually remember all the names at the moment but I will look it up...



Around 11.30 we arrived at Kutumbh. Mayur hadn't mentioned that it was in a slum so I had no time to mentally prepare myself. As soon as I got out of the autorickshaw three very small children greeted me with smiles and English 'hello madam, how are you?' I responded with 'namaste! Tum kaise ho?'. They laughed and ran away. We went right to the top of a building clad in marble and quite richly decorated in comparison to the shanty buildings outside. A door opened up onto a huge rooftop from where you could see the entire slum. It was exactly as you would imagine. It made my heart feel heavy but then I met the children of the orphanage who did nothing but smile, laugh, play and love to learn. I met the staff helping out here; Maneka, Jess, Nicole, Pam, Jane, two Michelles, Linley and Sandra from the night before. I spent the day with the staff and kids who made me realize that these children don't need nor do they want pity. They are happy with what they have and anything else is a bonus. That's not to say that they should be forgotten. They still need help to ensure that they can get the education and assistance they need to become the people they truly wish to become. Ten year old Mancy hopes to become a doctor. When I get back to the UK I intend to do as much as I can for this organization.



I stuck with Jess and Nicole who came with me and Mayur to the Puja Ceremony which takes place every day at 6pm on the ghats at the waters edge. Hundreds of people come to see the ceremony which is a beautiful display of dance, music, fire and incense. We watched most of it before heading down to the burning ghats where the human cremations take place. My guide, Mayur, decided against it as he felt that he and us would be suffer more hassle from touts than if he were not with us and so we continued alone. We were hassled by just one guy who tried to tell us about the burnings. We asked him not to as we had been warned that these men ften demand money for their services afterwards but he became really quite angry at the supposition that all Indians were just out to get your money. We had said nothing of the sort and I refused to be bullied. He backed down eventually but it was a little uncomfortable for a while.



We ate tonight at the Lotus on the water front which was great and I can recommend it strongly as a safe place to eat with good food and a great view over the Ganges. We made our way back through the streets of old town Varanasi in the dark which made it more difficult to to avoid the piss streams and piles of shit. We wandered passed tiny kiosks selling all sorts of weird and wonderful things but I am trying hard to resist the urge to buy anything until the last leg of my journey. Though I did treat myself to some fruity shower gel which I put into use immediately when I got back to the hostel.

Day two in India - En Route to Varanasi

07/01/12



Another bad nights sleep with people talking until late and then again early this morning. My back was in pieces from the taxi ride home from Colaba yesterday so I couldn't get comfortable and I'm panicking a little that I might not be able to carry on. It has gotten better through the day. I woke early to the sound of birds squawking and dogs howling below. It seems that the streets belong to the animals at this early hour.



Breakfast at the Anjali Inn was omelette and toast with beautifully spiced Chai. It was good. My taxi arrived on Indian time about 30mins late but I made it to Lokmanya Tilak Terminal well in time for my train. I checked the list for my name but could not see it so ran back to the enquiry desk to check I had been booked on. I was told it was all ok and that I was booked into carriage A1 seat 38 so I made my way towards the train on platform one. There are literally hundreds of people milling about at the station, all seemingly oblivious to my tired expression and sweat dripping down my face as they all proceed to block my path at every possible opportunity.



I get to the train, thinking that the upper class carriages will be the closest. I was wrong. I quickly realise that this is the longest train in the world and my carriage is about half a mile away. Luckily I have plenty of time to get there which is lucky because it takes me a while. I finally clamber aboard pouring with sweat and find my seat. My Indian roomies don't seem to understand why I am so hot but then I guess this is winter for them. They're also not carry around 25kg of stuff on their backs. I push my backpack up onto my bed and climb up after it. The man opposite then proceeds to stare at me sweating and huffing for at least 15mins before I hang a sarong up to hide from it all. India is a fantastic place but it can get to be too much sometimes. I read my book, watch a movie and catch up on my blog notes. I have the best nights sleep in a while, gently rocked by the swaying of the train on its tracks, the murmur of Indian voices and the quiet bellowing of some Indian music playing on another passengers phone. The sominex helped also.



Day Three in India - Varanasi First Impressions



08/01/12 I wake the next morning at around 10.30 am to find the the majority of my long journey is over. It has been comfortable and pleasant (though, unfortunately, the toilet shares neither of those attributes). I ask my Indian roomies repeatedly if how I find out which stop is my station Benares, or Varanasi in modern Hindi. They give constantly vague answers but see my concern and eventually say they will let me know when we are at Benares. I am grateful to them but still worried that I may miss it. We try to converse in english but even though the man I am speaking to says he speaks english and he probably really does believe that what he is saying is english, it definitely is not. I can pick out some words but the majority sounds like a hybrid language. Maybe it's Hinglish? I feel terrible that I am unable to understand or speak his language so I set about trying to learn some Hindi...which is a very very difficult language it turns out. In some cases there are five words to say just one English word!



I somehow manage to get off the train at the right station and am again surrounded but hundreds of people pushing to get on the train. I am squeezed out the other end to find that I am the only westerner as far as the eye can see. I crossover the platforms and see monkeys sat atop the station roofs. My train has arrived late so I call the hostel to see if the driver can pick me up now. After calling the wrong number several times, I eventually get through but have absolutely no idea what the man at the hostel is trying to say to me. I manage to grab 'driver' and 'two minutes' but nothing else so I wait. I get a call from another man who says he is waiting at the information office so I try in my panic stricken state to find the information office. I ask for directions but am pointed to the postal information office where I wait for ten minutes before another phone call. I manage to understand that we are not in the same place. I am in the wrong place. By this point I am close to tears with the constant gawking and the heavy weighted language barrier, plus my bags, plus not knowing where I am going. A group of young indian lads tell me I should go to the tourist information centre and tell me how to get there. I find the man who had called me and he introduces me to my driver. Relief is quickly followed by a certain level of caution as my driver is the most shifty looking character I've ever seen outside of a movie.



We walk to the rickshaw where he interacts suspiciously with other men, laughing, shaking hands and making mysterious exchanges. This is probably all very innocent but to me and my paranoia it looks bad. We drive through streets so dirty that the shit rises up the sides of building and seems to completely engulf the people walking in it. If Mumbai was a post apocalyptic city, Varanasi has no words to describe it. I wrap my sarong around my head so as to avoid attracting too much attention and we arrive as close to the hostel as is possible in the rickshaw. We have to walk from here. My guide hops off the rickshaw and stands watching as I struggle with my bag. We set off at his breakneck pace and I try to keep up as we meander through streets so narrow we struggle to pass by people on the other side. There are open doors that allow you a view into nothing but complete darkness beyond and miniature temples decorated with plastic figurines of chosen gods. The streets are filthy and I find myself pushed up against the walls as motorcyclists push passed. Despite all this I find I am in wonderment of this place.



It feels although I am walking back in time to a place that the rest of the world has forgotten. Eventually I see a sign for the hostel and am relieved that I have not been led by this shifty driver to my death in the dirty streets of Varanasi. I clamber up mountainous stairs and my guide, who sees me struggling, reaches out his left hand to help me. I grab it and in that moment try hard not to think about where it has been. I sit and wait.



Indian check in procedure is unlike anywhere else I've been. You just have to sit an wait whilst they do whatever it is that they are doing, sometimes you fill in a form, other times they are cleaning your room, other times you all just sit around chatting together until they feel that the moment is right to show you to your room. In this instance I met a Polish couple who were waiting for their taxi to the train station. I am ashamed to say that it felt good to speak to westerners and I asked how they liked Varanasi and if they had any tips for me while I'm here. They warned me of the wood touts who try to ingratiate themselves with you by telling you about the burnings but then demand money for their services. A young lad gathers my attention and asks if I would like to see the roof. 'Why not' I reply, wondering why he would want to show me the roof before showing me my room but I go along. The rooftop allows views over much of the old town of Varanasi and even down to the Ganges but the mist does not allow for a view to the other side. Thousands of small kites fill the sky and the boy tells me that there is a kite festival on the 14th January. The kites will have to fight in the sky for first place. The idea is that they have to intertwine with the other kites and cut their line. The stronger the line, the better. The boy introduces himself as Mayur. He is 18, studying economics at college and speaks excellent English. He seems embarrassed when I tell him this, he is embarrassed that he does not speak it as well as the English. He has never been taught it in school, he has learned only through the westerners that come to stay at the hostel. I am impressed. Finally he shows me to my room where I dump my bags and head bad to the reception area where Mayur waits to tell me about Varanasi. The streets are like a rabbit warren and I fear that if I ever leave the hostel that I will never find my way back. Luckily Mayur doubles as a tour guide and offers to show me around. I ask him for how much and he says that if I think he has done a good job then I should give whatever I think suitable. So we arrange to meet here at the hostel in the morning at 10am for a tour of the main Varanasi temples.



After mentioning to Mayur that I was interested in volunteering, he introduces me to Sandra whis works for an NGO helping children in the slums of Varanasi. We arrange for me to visit the orphanage after my temple tour in the morning to see what they do and to help out if I can.



I get an early night after dinner and fully expect to be woken several times...

The Taj Mahal - Agra, India
The Taj Mahal: Worth the Trip?

Everyone has seen the picture perfect postcards. We all know the worlds iconic travel images. This one has been called the most beautiful building in the world. On the day that I’m headed to the Taj Mahal, I decide to ponder on whether or not the journey to see this monument is really worth the trouble. Does this really live up to the hype? I’ve heard some say yes and I’ve heard some say no. I realize that asking a perennial tourist if any travel experience is worth doing is a little like asking a drug addict if they think the crack they’re about to buy is good value…but, I have a lot of time today to ponder the question and I vow to attempt to find an honest answer. Between 40 and 60,000 people a day (about 25% foreigners) visit this remote pinpoint in India. Are they disappointed? Thrilled? Moved? I would know for myself in a few hours.

There are many things to see and many experiences worth having in India. But the first question I ask myself is, “Would anyone have discovered the other wonders of India if the Taj
Scenery on the drive
Mahal had not drawn them here in the first place?” It also makes me wonder how many people would visit Egypt if there were no pyramids, how many people go to China because of the Great Wall?

The Taj Mahal and the Pyramids of Giza, which happen to be gravesites on steroids, are the most visited places in each of those countries. A quick poll of my fellow travelers says that no, Egypt and India would not be such frequented destinations without those big ticket draws. My tour guide agrees. Without the Taj, India would not have so many visitors and few would have learned of the other reasons to come here. Taj means crown and apparently this is not just the crown jewel of Indian tourism, it is the cornerstone on which the entire industry has been built. But the question is still whether or not it is worth the journey?

I can remember clearly the awe I felt when I gazed upon the massive pyramids, but the outskirts of Cairo is comparatively easy to reach. The Taj is much harder to access. The majority of foreign visitors to Agra are from the United States and the
Almost There
UK. It is an 8 hour flight from London to Delhi and a 14 hour flight from New York to Delhi (not including layovers). Once in Delhi, you’re still looking at about a 6 hour drive, depending on traffic, to get to the Taj. This is not a nice, scenic drive. It is a stop and go situation on bumpy roads that wind through streets lined with stark views of poverty, piles of trash, and the incessant sound of beeping horns. There are no fancy rest areas or beautiful vistas.

I chose to join a tour. There is a decent train from Delhi, but then you are at the mercy of taxi drivers and self-appointed guides begging for your business. Also, during the drive, the well-informed man on the microphone is telling us all sorts of interesting things that I might not have learned otherwise. Even in this relative comfort, around hour three my butt is sore and my neck is starting to cramp up. I’m wondering if I should have taken the train and braved the men who want to separate me from my money. By hour six, I am tired, sore and a bit carsick. It is
The Entry Gate
an overcast day with bad light and does not promise to be “worth it”. Finally, after a full 7 hours of driving, we arrive at our hotel for a quick wash-up and we head to the main attraction.

We have easy entry with no lines or hassles and suddenly I like our guide again. He whisks us through the process and we’re faced with an entry gate that would make an impressive monument by itself in most other countries. Just as we’re passing through the gate, the sun breaks through the clouds. Suddenly, first viewed through an archway, there it is bathed in white sunlight – the Taj Mahal. I am actually a bit choked up when I see it. I am definitely filled with awe to the point where it takes my breath away. I am immediately taken by the simplistic beauty, the massive size, the perfect symmetry. Mostly, I am moved by the gesture of building such a indescribable structure solely to honor a deceased loved one. How could any person possibly have been loved this much?

In that moment, the previous hours fade away and my answer is clear…it IS worth it.

However, I
Wow!
wonder if it is just me who is feeling this way. So, once again I poll my fellow travelers. There is a young couple from Italy. He actually becomes quite agitated when he answers, full of passion. “Without a doubt it is worth it. It is perfect, the most beautiful thing in the world. It shows what man can do. It is art. The real shame is that when we show the pictures to our families, they will never be able to feel what we feel standing here. This memory can only be carried inside.”

So, I guess millions of tourists aren’t wrong after all. I have frequently said, as I stood in long queues outside of the Eiffel Tower or the Coliseum in Rome - sometimes tourist attractions are tourist attractions for a reason, they are the things worth seeing. It goes beyond traveling thousands of miles for that perfect photo op. Every religion has their pilgrimages. Perhaps visiting these timeless monuments are the pilgrimages for all humanity. They show us the best in human innovation, passion, design and engineering. They show us what is possible and cannot help but inspire us. At the same time, standing before
Up Close - see the size!
these timeless structures gives us a connection to our collective past. So, although travel in India is not everyone’s cup of chai and I would not recommend cashing in the kids’ college fund to undertake these pilgrimages, anyone with the desire and means will likely not be disappointed. When you find the moments in life that take your breath away, they are most certainly worth the journey.

Nepal is AWESOME..and I don't mean in a wanky American sense of the word, I mean I'm totally in AWE of this amazing country!..As soon as I was landing in the plane and saw the vast landscape of mountains I wished I'd booked more time here! The overland tour I booked from Kathmandu to Delhi starts on the 29th December which means I have two nights and only one whole day to explore! So to make the most of it I hire a guide and a driver (blew my budget for that day!) and headed up into the mountains. It is so beautiful! I had a ""mini"" trek across the hills then headed into old Kathmandu to explore the temples which are equally as impressive.

So after spending all day with my guide, I must admit I started to tire of the small talk, I was relieved to get to my next hotel for the night to meet the group I'd be travelling with for the next 2 weeks. The man on reception tells me the girl I'm sharing a room with is already here so I go up to the room to meet her, to which I am greeted by Cassie; ""Hi, nice to meet you...I'm so sorry I didn't know I was sharing - the room's a mess and I've just done a poo in the toilet...but come in!"" - Needless to say I found this hilarious!...We spent the next hour chatting away - both nearly 30, single women, feel completely out our depth without our heels & make-up, but with a silly sense of humour...this is going to be fun!

Then we go downstairs to meet the group co-ordinators - Jenny & Phil. Jenny's an American girl and has one of those really annoying voices..? That go up at the end of every sentence..?...She proceeds with an introduction to the trip - telling us every possible bad thing that could (and has previously) happened..(ie truck breaking down, Phil getting electrocuted...etc..etc) and also talks about toilet stops...(while holding a shovel in her hand)...I'm sorry, I'm all for roughing it but I ain't shovelling no shit! Thankfully there has been no need for this as yet.

Then there's Phil - ""over enthusiastic Phil"" as I like to call him. Which he very much isn't. A fellow Yorkshire man, he loves his Yorkshire Tea, but hates travelling (strange for a man in this job I did think) and he HATES India...in fact his very words at our first group dinner were ""I went to India expecting it to be shit, and it is shit.""...Well nothing like getting us excited! But I'm happy to form my own opinion. I've since discovered that his mundane, relaxed, carefree attitude to everything is absolutely perfect for driving this big truck around the crazy streets!

So the ""Truck"" that we ae travelling in is a big white and orange thing, not the most comfortable but its BIG, MEAN and has a really loud horn!...It's also called ""Kristina""...of course little resemblance to myself...but I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere..

Anyway, from Kathmandu we head out to Chitwan National Park and arrive at Rhino Lodge around lunchtime. A lovely little guesthouse on the river. We take a dug out canoe down the river and spot lots of crocodiles...the sun is shining, the birds are singing, it's so peaceful and I doze off for a moment - what a perfect afternoon.

The next day - New Years Eve. After a lazy morning, we take a jeep down to the river where the elephants are bathing. Three of us (myself, Cassie and man named David on our trip) all climb on the back of the Elephant in the water. We're all clinging on to each other like mad to try not to fall off, at which point David takes the opportunity to hold on to my bum! Dirty old man! Though at that moment in time I was concentrating on not falling off and getting crushed by the elephant!...He did apologise later. Anyway the elephnat then sprayed us with his truck a few times before dumping us in the water. It was an amazing experience!

The afternoon was then more Elephants!...We rode them out into the National Park in search of Rhino - and saw one!...It was a truly special moment, with the stunning safari scenery and the snow capped Himalayas in the background. We then watched the last sunset of 2011 over the river, ate, drank & danced under the stars around the fire to bring in the new year - perfect! 😊

PS. Will upload photos when I get a fast enough internet connection!

Morning bathing ritual
Geo: 25.282, 82.9563

Jan 1-2 Agra to Varanasi

Train- 3AC – interesting experience. Two extra people per cabin at this level and therefore much more cramped. We did manage to get some sleep but what we thought was a 9 hour train trip turned out to be 13 hours. Not sure if the train was delayed along the way (we did stop a long time at a couple of places) or if I wrote the arrival time down incorrectly. No matter, we arrived in Varanasi safe and sound. Got an auto-rickshaw to our guest house – Sahi River View Guest House. We are right on a minor ghat-Assi. A Ghat is a narrow street, leading to a set of steps descending to the western bank of the Ganges River. The Assi Ghat is a good location, much quieter than further up the river and the bigger Ghats. I definitely would not want to be along one of the burning Ghats – the smoke would be really bad and there is likely activity at these 24 hours.

We did walk all along the Ghats yesterday and saw several of the burnings/cremations underway. It is such a holy ritual for Hindus. I felt a bit uncomfortable
Weighing wood for burning pires
– not because of the cremations but because we are outsiders and this is such an important thing. I don't know enough about Hinduism to totally understand but I do know that to be die means you will past directly to heaven – no need to be re-born and keep trying to get there. It is called 'moksha' which means liberation from life and death. What I don't know is why that is – i.e. who decided this was the case? If anyone knows the answer to this, please share. Otherwise, I will research it more and add the info when I have it.

Tid bit: Varanasi was once called Kasha which means City of Life. It is thought to date back to 1200 BC and in the 8th century Shankaracharya, a reformer of Hinduism, established Shiva worship the principal sect. The city was looted and mostly destroyed by Aurangzeb (he was a very bad guy) so most of the buildings, even in the old city are about 200 years old – relatively new for India.

We searched and searched for the Brown Bread Bakery restaurant because it was an ‘our pick' in the LP guide. We asked directions from several people
Cricket, cricket and more cricket
and while left and then left again were clear to them, the streets in the area we were in were narrow alley ways chock full of shops and it was very easy to miss a ‘left'. We tried a rickshaw (man-powered) who insisted he knew where it was but he took us to the Mona Lisa German Bakery (interesting name) so we had him take us back to where he picked us up. WE did finally find the BBB** and it was not worth the effort we put in to finding it. The LP guide we are using is from 2009 and I think the BBB has probably seen better days. It looked very worn and it was not very clean so we decided to head back to our guest house and eat there. Right before we got there, we saw a sign for the Pizzeria Vaatik Café and decided to check it out. It was a pleasant garden balcony overlooking the Assi Ghat and we had 2 of everything – 2 pizzas, 2 black teas and 2 slices of apple pie for dessert. It turned out to be a very ful-FILLING event. We found our way back to our
Ash Man
guest house and crashed for the night.

***On our second day in Varanasi we accidentally came across the real BBB. Turns out there are several copy cats and their name is very similar. I am sure the new version of LP has noted this. Richard had an XL coffee lassi and I had tea and chocolate cake with ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce. Yum!

Day 2 - Varanasi

We took our time this morning with a leisurely breakfast and checking email. Then we headed out again onto the streets and alley ways of Varanasi. The sun was out so everything looked very different. It is amazing how much difference a little bit of sunshine makes. We walked along the Ghats again and headed up into the old city at the Manmandir Ghat. We found the Dolphin Restaurant which on the roof of a very nice guest house. As we were ascending the steps someone ignited a firecracker. I was only a few feet away from it and besides being WAY to loud, it scared the sh…. out of me. I was upset and the staff at the guest house was very concerned. I think they shoo-ed the perpetrator away. We ascended the
Washing clothes
god knows how many flights of stairs to the rooftop and enjoyed a lovely lunch. Once again the food was delicious. We ate a lot and lingered in the warm sunshine before heading out again to wander. It is very easy to find yourself going around in circles in these small alleyways. You start to realize it when you start passing the same shop keepers. It's fun and I am guessing the shop keepers are rolling their eyes thinking how dumb western tourists are. We haven't had a lot of hassle here from touts and hawkers contrary to the warnings I have read. The boatmen only ask once or twice and then leave you alone. The beggars are a big more persistent but we have seen worse. The kids selling postcards and flowers are cute and fun to talk to. We chatted with the same little boy we bought postcards from yesterday and a young girl who liked the bag I had (from an Ayurvedic store where I bought face cream that will get rid of all my wrinkles in 2 weeks!). I gave her the bag and she was very pleased.

We are now back at the Shahi and are
Drying laundry
relaxing until it is time to go eat again!

Taj Mahal
FROM VARANASI WE BOARDED A TRAIN WEST in the direction of India’s pride and joy, the most famous symbol of this immense land, the Taj Mahal. This first experiment of using the large and complicated Indian rail system was essentially…a train wreck. We were completely clueless as to how the several tiered ticketing system worked. Just before midnight we climbed aboard the sleeper car, which in the eerie darkness resembled a scene out of a science fiction movie. The steel metal bars and blue berths were overflowing with unfamiliar faces and huge black eyes that peered out of the darkness at me. Of course, they were just the outward expression of inquiring minds but at the time they seemed intense and unkind. We had booked our rail tickets online but not having access to a printer, we had no proof of our purchase. This ended up causing quite a mess. The first conductor that approached us could not find our names on his list so he asked us to move back to a different sleeper car, which meant another round of penetrating stares. Just as we were settling in to our new spot a second conductor came around. He could not
Travis and I
find our names either, so again we moved. After a long uncomfortable wait both conductors convened around us and just at the pivotal moment when they were to send us to the treacherous back lurches of the train (where we would have to squeeze between the sweaty haunches of unfamiliar men for the next ten hours) when I asked to see their paper with list of passenger names. I looked down at the paper and instantly the big, bold letters jumped out at me, “Claire Staley, W Travis Staley.” Our names had been there in plain sight the entire time. Similar situations have occurred at other times during our travels - I assume people are just unfamiliar with our names and therefore don’t know how to spell them or what they look like on paper. Once at a hotel someone checked us in under the name “KATHY.” I hope the real Kathy wasn’t pissed when she showed up and saw that her room was booked. Even though our names had been found, not all was solved, as one of our berths was far away at the other end of the train car. Not wanting to separate in this new, unfamiliar
Early Morning Light
environment we both climbed into one of the bunks with ALL of our luggage and attempted to lay down and sleep in this impossibly cramped space. We laid down, limbs tangled in most uncomfortable ways. I used Travis’ feet as a pillow and he used mine as his. Ten hours later we arrived in Agra limbs aching.Thus began our rail journey across India.

Our stop in Agra was quick. We did very little the first day other than sit at the restaurant and watch the hordes of mischievous monkeys bounce around from rooftop to rooftop trying to steal food from the nearby restaurants. Our restaurant even had it’s own “monkey control” - a guy with a large bamboo stick who stood close by as we ate and chased the monkeys away every time they dared to come near. A few kilometers away, the outline of the milky, white Taj Mahal rose out of the rooftops. We woke up early the next morning to get to the Taj for sunrise. Unfortunately, even at this early time there was still quite a lot of tourists. Despite this it was lovely to see this monument that has been embedded in our collective
Exploring Agra Fort
minds through endless photographs, movies and tales. We spent the morning wandering leisurely through the grounds; taking in the serene fountains, gardens, and of course the mausoleum itself where Emperor Shah Jahan and his second wife, Mumtaz Mahal, are buried. That afternoon we attempted to go shopping at a bazaar but the constant fear of being hit by a car and the deafening horns were so intense that we gave up and instead visited Agra Fort, a red sandstone fort constructed by the Mughal emperors in the 1500s. It had beautiful dark corridors, large open courtyards, and stunning views of the Taj across the plains.

Aside from the Taj Mahal and the fort Agra did not have much to offer – it was a typical dusty Indian city – full of cows roaming the streets and the usual chaos. Our time there, however, happened to coincide with a large Muslim festival so the streets were full of families celebrating in all forms of rivalry. This made the experience more fun – there was singing, dancing, drumming and music blazing out of loud speakers. It was really fun to see the Indian people in this heightened state of joy, and
Gardens
for the first time I felt like I could connect with them. Their smiles and laughter dissolved any and all cultural differences we may have had. As we were walking through the streets one evening a little boy accidentally swung a neon sword in my direction and came inches from hitting me. I jumped back in surprise. His family looked up to take note of the situation, and upon seeing who I was, erupted in hysterical laughter. They swooped in and surrounded me on all sides, roaring in laughter and begging me to take photos with them. Of course, I obliged.

PUSHKAR:

After Agra we traveled to the small, Hindu pilgrimage town of Pushkar (navigating the trains more successfully this time). The tale of Pushkar is so beautiful that it would be a sin not to share. As the story goes Brahma (one of the three main gods of Hinduism) dropped a lotus flower on the earth and from it’s seed, Pushkar appeared. I wanted to visit Pushkar based solely on this tale - how could you not want to visit such an idyllic setting for a story?! Even though Pushkar is now a bit touristy, the story
Chillin'
still fits. The highlight of the town is the large blue lake that sits in it’s center, surrounded by multiple temples and ghats. On our first day we were lured in by it’s calm waters and decided to go closer to investigate. As we walked towards the water two men approached us and handed us flower petals. One of them asked Travis to follow him while the other lead me a couple feet away in the other direction (men and women are frequently separated in India so this did not cause concern). I sat down with him at the edge of the water and he explained to me that he was a Brahmin priest and he would like to lead me in a blessing for my family. He began chanting something in another language and then had me repeat the words after him. The foreign syllables tasted strange and sticky on my tongue. Next, he translated the words into English, and again I repeated (good health, good mother, good father, good marriage…). Finally, he had me name all of my family members. It felt really special to say each of their names out loud in this holy place thereby offering
Old Rangji Temple
each of them an individual blessing. Finally, he showed me how to throw the different colored petals into the water and ritually wash my hands. Once the blessing was finished he asked me if I would be willing to make a donation to him and the other Brahmin priests. I knew this was coming of course (nothing is free in India, even things you don’t want) so I told him that I would talk to my husband and we would decide on an amount. I walked over to Travis and discovered that he had already left a donation with his priest that was intended for both of them. I kindly explained to my priest that we had already left a sizeable donation and this would have to suffice. He quickly explained that these donations would help us acquire merit and give us good karma. My karma is different than Travis’ karma, he insisted, therefore we must both leave an offering. Although I don't believe in acquiring good karma by paying people off, I do believe in supporting the communities we visit, so we forked over more cash. It was slightly irritating, but none of the sights in Pushkar cost any
Old Rangji Temple
money so we just regarded the donation as our entrance fee to the city. The next few days slipped lazily by - we slept in late, drank lassis and chai, and watched the sun set from rooftop cafes.

Starting along the ghats
Veranasi is a holy city where people come to be married and to die or have their bodies burnt, and I can see no other reason to come – it is the pits.



Taxi from the airport should be about 400 rupees but you may have to pay 500 depending on how many taxi drivers have dropped people off and are looking to go home.



The centre places of tourism are the Ghats (steps) which, for about a 2 miles stretch, come down to the Ganges. There are several things going on; washing of clothes, men washing and most importantly the burning of bodies. Some are brought hundreds of miles to be burnt here. There are two burning sites, one can burn 50-60 bodies a day and the second one considerably more as bodies are burnt 24/7. Bodies are washed in the Ganges then taken ashore and laid on logs with more logs laid on top of them, then set alight. Most of the body is burnt but what is usually left are the hips of women and the chests of men, these are then thrown in the Ganges or taken by boat to the
